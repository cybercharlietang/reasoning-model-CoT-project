    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\nWait, 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break that down. 29,000 * 3 = 87,000. 524 * 3 = 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier. It looks like each layer is following the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which in this case is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n9/2 = 3A\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier terms to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I consider the entire expression as 3*a_9, then:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly, both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a general formula for the nth layer. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Solving the recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me write each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where each L is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's compute each one step by step. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, L2 is 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me keep going. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9. So, the final computation is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. I can break this down: 29000 * 3 = 87000, and 524 * 3 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me recalculate each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and the numbers add up as expected. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nPlugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1 into the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 should be 13.\n\nFormula: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without manually calculating each layer. That's pretty efficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that the entire expression is a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, if I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, it's 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, it's like a continued multiplication and addition.\n\nBut since I've already found a formula for a_n, and verified it, I think I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But the original problem is 3 times that Layer 9. So, do I need to multiply this result by 3? Let me check the original problem again. It says: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So yes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Therefore, the final result is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute this step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if that's the case. Let me define a recurrence relation. Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation might give a formula for a_n, which could save computation time. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find D first by setting a_n = D, so D = 1 + 3*D, which gives D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, and the particular solution is -1/2. Therefore, a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2= 4.5 => C=4.5 /3= 1.5= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, both methods give the same result. I think this solidifies that the answer is indeed 88,572. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through Layers 1 to 3 again: Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3:29524*3=88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}:3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Perfect, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 2 equals 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 equals 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093.

Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That confirms the result. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and moving outward, each layer's value is calculated. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3. The step-by-step computation confirms that the final value is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct, but let me verify with another approach because sometimes when you have multiple layers, there might be a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nWait a minute, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me think about this as a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier terms to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all the layers I computed earlier. That's a relief; it means my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572. So, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the entire expression using the formula. Since each layer n corresponds to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9, so:\n\nTotal expression = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used two methods: step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, both leading to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, but wait a second, I just noticed that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, is Layer 9 the correct outermost layer? Let me count the number of layers. Each time there's a new layer, the number of (1+3(...) increases. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another. Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each step adds a layer:\n\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the initial 3. So, yes, Layer 9 is correct, and then the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29,524=88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try another approach by expanding the expression step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting after the initial 3, the first parenthesis is at position 1: 3(...\n\nThen each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, actually, when I count the opening parentheses, it's 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, a_9 is indeed the correct outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59,048\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, same result.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me check the formula again. The formula I derived was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4.

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. Let's break that down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. I think that's right. Each step seems to follow logically, and I didn't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and there are nine layers of 1 + 3 inside each other, right? But when I started counting, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost 1 + 3, which is correct. So, when I compute Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524, that seems right. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3. So, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total value would be 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to double-check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572 (correct)\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was the innermost part, but actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*next layer). So, perhaps I should have started with Layer 1 as the innermost 1 + 3, then Layer 2 as 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)), but wait, no, the structure is each time 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe my initial approach was slightly off.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how I labeled the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, the first 1 + 3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Wait, but let me check: when I compute Layer 9, I get 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's correct. So, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but in this case, a = 3, so let's compute the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nCompute L_1 through L_9 using L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nL_1: (3^2 -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=4\nL_2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=13\nL_3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=40\nL_4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=121\nL_5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=364\nL_6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=1093\nL_7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=3280\nL_8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=9841\nL_9: (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=29524\n\nYes, all match the earlier computations. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is correct. To recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n- Each layer can be computed step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n- Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allows using a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer directly.\n- Both methods lead to the same result, which is 88,572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\). Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the total is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations again because the layers went up to Layer 9, but I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, each time I computed a layer, I was moving one step out, so Layer 1 is innermost, Layer 9 is outermost, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, getting 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Let me check each multiplication step again:\n\nLayer 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Let me confirm this multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute 29524*3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if I interpreted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, I computed one layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. The formula approach also confirms the result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\). Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by computing the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Therefore, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3 times Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Therefore, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3 times Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1,092. Then, 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. So, Layer 6 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1,093, so 3*1,093 is 3,279. Adding 1 gives 3,280. Therefore, Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3,280, so 3*3,280 is 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 is 9,841. So, Layer 8 is 9,841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9,841, so 3*9,841 is 29,523. Adding 1 gives 29,524. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29,524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, I need to compute 3 * 29,524. Let me do that: 3 * 29,524. Hmm, let's compute that step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go back and verify each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can find another equation by considering n=0, but since n starts at 1, maybe we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29,524=88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, let me see: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, 177,147 - 3 = 177,144. Then, 177,144 divided by 2 is 88,572. Yep, that matches my earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that makes sense. It's a pretty large number because each layer is multiplied by 3, leading to exponential growth. So, starting from 4 and multiplying by 3 each time, it's no surprise that after nine layers, the number is in the tens of thousands, and then multiplying by another 3 at the end gives us over 88,000. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute it another way: 29524*3. 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's digit-wise multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation gives a general formula for each layer, which we then apply to find the value of the entire expression.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 2 equals 13. Now, moving to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. I wonder if each layer is following a certain formula. Let me try to compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, no, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Now, moving outward, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2):\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so each time we compute a layer, we take the previous result, multiply it by 3, add 1, and that gives us the next layer's value. Let me try to find a pattern here or maybe a formula so I don't have to compute each layer manually, which would take a long time.\n\nWait, so each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That seems like a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n.\n\nLet me think about this recursive relation. It looks similar to a geometric series. Let me write it down:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps I can compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLet me compute a few more layers.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot.

Now, the original problem is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 9 as we computed. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me break it down properly.\n\nWait, 29524 is 29,524.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524.\n\nLet me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000.\n\nBut since it's 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 3*476.\n\nCompute 3*476:\n\n400*3 = 1,200\n\n70*3 = 210\n\n6*3 = 18\n\nSo, 1,200 + 210 = 1,410 + 18 = 1,428.\n\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check by another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit.\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression had nine layers inside the outermost 3. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the one just inside the outermost 3. So, 3*(Layer 9) is indeed 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by computing each layer again step by step, just to make sure I didn't make an error in any layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, earlier I wrote 1093, but 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem starts with 3(1+3(...)), so it's 3 times Layer 9, which is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's see:\n\nIf I have a nested expression like a + 3(b + 3(c + 3(...))), it can be represented as a + 3b + 3^2 c + 3^3 d + ... up to n terms.\n\nIn our case, each layer is 1, so starting from the innermost, each term is 1, and each time it's multiplied by 3 as we go outward.\n\nSo, the expression can be written as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) = 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWhich is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))).\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to model this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me consider that each layer adds another term. Let me try to model this.\n\nEach time we go a layer outward, we add another 1 and multiply by 3. So, for n layers, the value would be:\n\nSum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k * 1, but I'm not sure if that's exactly correct because each layer is built upon the previous one. Wait, perhaps it's a sum of 3^k where k goes from 0 to n, but let me check.\n\nWait, let me think of it as each layer contributing 3^k * 1, where k is the number of layers. But in our case, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, so perhaps the total would be 3*(3^9 - 1)/ (3 - 1), but let me verify.\n\nWait, the standard formula for a geometric series is Sum = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn our case, starting from the innermost layer, each term is 1, and each time we go outward, we multiply by 3. So, the innermost term is 1, then 3*1, then 3*(1 + 3*1), etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as each layer contributing 3^k * 1, where k is the depth.\n\nWait, but in our case, when we have 9 layers, each time we have an additional multiplication by 3. So, the total would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me count how many 1's there are. Wait, each layer adds a 1, so with 9 layers, we have 9 ones, each multiplied by 3^k, where k ranges from 0 to 8, but then multiplied by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, maybe the total is 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Let me check that.\n\nBecause each layer adds another 3^k term. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1, then 3*1, then 3*(1 + 3*1), etc., so each time we're adding 3^k * 1, where k is the number of layers from the innermost.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, the innermost is 3^0 *1, then next is 3^1 *1, up to 3^8 *1. Then, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k *1, which is a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, ratio 3.\n\nThe sum would be (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841.\n\nWait, that's exactly Layer 9, which we computed earlier as 29,524. Wait, no, Layer 9 was 29,524, but here, the sum is 9,841. Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the sum inside the outermost 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))) with 9 layers. So, the sum inside is actually Layer 9, which is 29,524. Wait, but according to the geometric series, it should be 9,841. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of terms. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if I have 9 layers, each adding a 1 and multiplied by 3 each time, then the total inside the outermost 3 would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1))), where there are 9 ones. So, the sum would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, which is a geometric series with 9 terms, starting at 3^0 up to 3^8.\n\nSo, the sum would be (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, which is 3*9,841 +1? Wait, no, because Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8, and Layer8 is 9,841, so Layer9 is 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, the sum inside the outermost 3 is 29,524, which is 1 + 3*(sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^7). So, perhaps the inner sum is up to 3^7, not 3^8.\n\nWait, maybe the number of layers is 9, but the exponents go from 0 to 8, which would make 9 terms. So, the sum inside the outermost 3 is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, which is 9 terms, so sum is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9,841. Then, the outermost 3 multiplies this sum, giving 3*9,841 = 29,523. But wait, that's not matching with our earlier computation where Layer9 was 29,524. Hmm, I must have a confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the outermost 3 is multiplying the sum, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which itself is a sum that includes multiple layers. So, maybe the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*(9,841) = 29,523. But earlier, when I computed each layer step by step, I ended up with 88,572, which is 3*29,524. So, there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that perhaps my approach using the geometric series is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not accounting for the fact that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is different from just adding 3^k *1. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me denote S(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, S(1) = 4\n\nS(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nS(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nS(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nS(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nS(7) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nS(8) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nS(9) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so according to this, the sum is 88,572, which is 3 times S(9). But earlier, when I tried to model it as a geometric series, I got 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9,841 = 29,523, which is different.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach with the geometric series was wrong because each layer is not simply adding 3^k *1, but rather each layer is built upon the previous one with the recursive formula S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1). Therefore, the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier, leading to the total expression being 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for S(n). Let me try to find it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is S(n) = 3*S(n-1), which has the solution S_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution S_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is S(n) = S_h(n) + S_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition S(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nS(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nS(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nS(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nS(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, S(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9 layers inside the outermost 3, so S(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, S(9) = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again by using the closed-form expression. Since the problem is 3*(S(9)), which is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. That's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence relation, and finding a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write this out step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layers 1 through 9 are correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, but when I added up earlier, I got 88572 as well. So, maybe my initial thought that it was wrong was incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let me break down 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that maybe I made a mistake, but it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I consider the entire expression as 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let me consider the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3) ... )))\n\nEach time, we have a 1 plus 3 times something. So, when expanded, each layer contributes a power of 3. Let me see if I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(3 +1) =1 + 3^2 +3^1 = 1 + 9 + 3 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13 =1 + 3*(1 + 9 + 3) =1 + 3 + 27 + 9 =40\n\nWait, but that seems a bit convoluted. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, as we saw.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWhich is (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's nested, so perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=10, but adjusted because of the initial 1s.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which, when expanded, would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to some term.\n\nWait, actually, each time you have a 1 multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers. Let me try to see how many terms there are.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another power of 3. So, for 9 layers, we might have 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure. Let me check with the formula.\n\nWait, from the formula, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(Layer 9) is (3^{11} -3)/2. So, that's equal to (3*(3^{10} -1))/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, that's 3^{11}/2 - 3/2. Hmm, but 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147/2 is 88573.5, and subtracting 3/2 (which is 1.5) gives 88572, which matches our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me consider that each time we have 1 added, and then multiplied by 3. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be thought of as 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to n terms, where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so maybe it's 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so when you expand it, it's more like each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 10, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the entire expression manually to see the pattern.\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLevel 3:1 +3*(Level2)=1 +39=40\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=121\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=364\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I had before. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure I didn't make any mistakes, let me compute it using the formula I derived earlier.\n\nThe expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways now. Each method I use leads me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000) = 60000, 3*(9000) = 27000, 3*(500) = 1500, 3*(20) = 60, and 3*(4) = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. I think I did each step correctly.

Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12.

So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me try to compute a few more layers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me do that step by step: 9000*3 = 27,000; 800*3 = 2,400; 40*3 = 120; 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final computation is 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake along the way. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, I wrote 1093 earlier, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Let me verify that multiplication again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. Hmm, but wait a second, I just realized that the original expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which we calculated as 88,572. But let me think again about the structure. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, we compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So, the steps seem correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this without computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524. So, the pattern here is that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but L_1 is 4, not L_0. Maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see. If I set L_0 as the initial term, then L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. But in our case, L_1 is 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*L_0 => L_0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, L_0 = 1. Then, the general solution for L_n would be L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Substituting a = 3, b = 1, L_0 = 1: L_n = 3^n * 1 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Let me compute that: L_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^5 = 243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243. 200*200 = 40,000; 200*40 = 8,000; 200*3 = 600; 40*200 = 8,000; 40*40 = 1,600; 40*3 = 120; 3*200 = 600; 3*40 = 120; 3*3 = 9. Wait, that's too tedious. Alternatively, I can compute 243*243 as (240 + 3)^2 = 240^2 + 2*240*3 + 3^2 = 57,600 + 1,440 + 9 = 57,600 + 1,440 = 59,040 + 9 = 59,049. So, 3^10 = 59,049. Therefore, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I broke down the nested expression layer by layer, computed each layer step by step, verified each computation, then recognized a pattern that allowed me to use a recurrence relation formula to find the nth layer value, which confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

It's easy to make an error with large numbers.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer's computation again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. It might be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n9/2 = 3*C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, this formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 = 59048.\n\n59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then:\n\nTotal expression = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, 177147 -3 = 177144.\n\n177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only 9 layers, the step-by-step approach was manageable, but using the formula is more efficient, especially if there were more layers.\n\nWait, just to clarify, how many layers are there? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n...\nUp to 9 layers because there are 9 sets of (1+3(... before the last 1+3).\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(... So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and building outward up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(... So, the formula with n=9 gives us Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula approach correctly models the problem.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nIf I denote each layer as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, which we solved earlier using standard methods, leading to L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, using this formula, we can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient.\n\nBut since I've already computed each layer step-by-step and verified the result with the formula, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n- By computing each layer step-by-step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the value of the innermost expression being 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and finally 29524 for the outermost layer.\n- Multiplying this outermost layer by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n- Alternatively, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9, gives L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives the same result, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe outermost layer is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.

Now, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's 40. Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, that's getting big quickly.

Let me check: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute step by step: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given the small number of layers (only nine), computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to recall a formula, especially since I'm still getting comfortable with these kinds of problems. Wait, actually, now that I think about it, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. This seems to follow the pattern: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we've already computed to see if it holds. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that's the answer. I think I'm confident in this result because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same answer. It's always reassuring when different methods lead to the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested structure from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I broke it down earlier, I got 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12, which is 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So both methods give me 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let's go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. I can compute this as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Let's continue this process step by step.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression starts with 3 times the first layer. So, after computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, do I just multiply that by 3? Let me check the original problem again: It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So yes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the total value would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9524 = 28572, so adding them together: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, that seems too big. Let me verify the calculations step by step because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and compute each layer again carefully.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again: Each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, so the numbers are growing exponentially. It's possible that the result is indeed 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step, writing down each intermediate result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, it's a recursive expression where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the sequence goes:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 layers, but the way it's written, the first multiplication by 3 is outside all the parentheses. So, maybe I should check how many times the 3 is being multiplied. Let me count the number of 3( terms in the original problem.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, each opening parenthesis is preceded by a 3(, except the very first one. Let me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another 3(\n3. Another 3(\n4. Another 3(\n5. Another 3(\n6. Another 3(\n7. Another 3(\n8. Another 3(\n9. Another 3(\n\nWait, so from the first 3(, there are 8 more 3( inside. So, actually, the number of layers is 9, but the outermost is 3*(...), and then inside that, there are 8 more layers. So, maybe my initial count was correct: 9 layers, with Layer 1 being the innermost 1 + 3, and Layer 9 being the outermost expression before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, if I have n layers, the total expression is 3*(a_n), where a_n is built from n layers of 1 + 3*... So, in this case, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1 + 3( inside.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the number of opening parentheses is 8, because each 3( introduces a new layer. So, the innermost expression is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the total number of layers is 8 + 1 = 9? Wait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time you have a 3(, it's a new layer. So, the first 3( starts the expression, then each subsequent 3( adds another layer. So, how many 3( are there in the expression? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. Then inside, 3(\n3. Then 3(\n4. Then 3(\n5. Then 3(\n6. Then 3(\n7. Then 3(\n8. Then 3(\n9. Then 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times 3(, but the last one is 3(1+3), which is the innermost. So, actually, the number of layers is 9, each adding another 3*(...). Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial computation was correct: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term of this sequence. Since each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms:\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2713\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2713\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2713\n\nFor n=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2713\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few terms. So, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2713\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that the formula is correctly applied. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 59049 * 3 = 177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used the recursive approach, derived a formula for the nth term, and verified it with known values. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By calculating each layer step by step or using the derived formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find that the innermost layer \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step was computed correctly. Let me verify Layer 9 again: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I did each step correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Let's define each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where each L is equal to 1 + 3 times the previous layer. But wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me think. Wait, no, because each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, which is L1: L1 = 1 + 3 Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 Then, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on until L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, yes, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), starting from the innermost. So, L1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, and so on until L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, to compute this, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 and moving outward to L9, then multiply the final result by 3. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, compute L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing L9, which is the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, let me compute that.\n\nTotal expression = 3*L9 = 3*29524\n\nNow, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing L9.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...), so each layer is an additional 1+3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\n2. Then, the next is 1+3(1+3).\n\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)).\n\nAnd so on, until we have nine layers. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3, then another 1+3, etc. So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3 nested inside each other. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer is 1+3(...), the second is 1+3(1+3(...)), etc. Let me count the number of times we have 1+3 inside each other.\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, it's:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until we have nine layers. Wait, but in the original expression, how many 1+3 terms are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The last 1+3 is layer 1.\n\n2. Then, the one before that is layer 2.\n\n3. Continuing outward, each time we have another layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3, so from the innermost to the outermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nSo, yes, nine layers. Therefore, my earlier calculation is correct, with L9 being 29524, and the total expression being 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me write down each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, all correct. Now, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any errors in my calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by computing each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12.

Let me check how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 1+3, each subsequent 1+3 is nested inside. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so each layer is an additional 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3 around it. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... Up to Layer 9, because the expression has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). So, yes, there are 9 layers, each computed by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me tabulate this to keep track:\n\nLayer | Calculation | Value\n-----|-------------|------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\n\nSo, after computing each layer, Layer 9 gives us 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 3 * 29,524. Let's compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that subtraction: 90,000 - 1,428. 90,000 minus 1,000 is 89,000. Then minus 428 more is 89,000 - 428 = 88,572. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n---------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, hold on, in my initial calculation, I wrote 1093, but 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers check out, and the final result is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Let me start with the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let's go to Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Wow, that's increasing quickly. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me try to compute each layer step by step up to Layer 9. Let me make a table to keep track:\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply that result by 3. Let me check that again. The original problem is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) where the innermost is 1+3. So, yes, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 *3 is actually 88572. Let me verify: 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the total expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if I can apply that here. The initial condition is a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging n=2 into the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B =13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B =4 and 9A + B=13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 =>6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2. Now, substituting A=3/2 into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B =4 =>9/2 + B=4 => B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's value. After computing up to Layer 9, we find its value to be 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. Adding them gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding these: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the expression without computing each layer. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. As we found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} and so on, but I think the way I did it is correct. Let me just confirm the arithmetic once more, because with such large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer by carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying the result using a recurrence relation approach. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, moving to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40 So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 Let me compute 3*40 first: that's 120. So, Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 121 times 3 is 363. So, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 Let me calculate 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Therefore, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 Let me compute 3*1093.

So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations. So, the final result should be 88572. I think that's it!\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, okay, let's keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280.

    "text": " Let me write each layer as a variable to make it easier. Let me define L1, L2, ..., L9 where each L corresponds to the value of that layer. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that seems manageable. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's jumping up quickly. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on. The original problem is 3 times the outermost layer, which is L9. So, the total expression is 3*(L9). Since L9 is 29524, then 3*29524 would be the result. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our initial conditions are integers, so maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence in terms of a geometric series. Let's try expanding the terms:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nWait, hold on, that seems different from before. Wait, no, in L3, it's 1 + 3*L2, which was 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is correct. But when I expanded it, I got 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, which is 40. Similarly, L4 would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, which is correct. So, each L_n is equal to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^{n-1}. Wait, let me check that.\n\nFor L1: n=1, sum is 1 = 1. But L1 is 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so maybe it's a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps the general formula for L_n is (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but L1 is 4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test:\n\nn=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. That matches L1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. That's L2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. That's L3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for L9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. If I let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers. But since each layer is similar, maybe I can find a relationship between E and itself, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here because E is specifically nine layers deep. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each time we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, when we expand each layer, we get a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nFor example, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, each L_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but wait, no. Wait, L1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, L2 is sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 =13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors when computing 3*29524. Let me compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n24 *3=72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple ways, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed and used in the next. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows the use of a formula to find the sum efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1), compute each subsequent layer using the formula:\n   - Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1))\n\n3. **Use the Geometric Series Formula**: Recognize that each layer is a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed L1 to L9, I ended up with 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be correct. Let me confirm the calculations once more:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I did everything right. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached, which is then multiplied by 3. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... Wait, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123, so 2400 + 123 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is... Let's see, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, then 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for C and D. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D = 3C + D. Also, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant D. To find D, we can set a_n = D, then D = 3*D + 1. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3C => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11} which is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524 = 88572\nWait, that seems pretty large, but considering the number of layers, maybe it's correct. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\nThen, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\nWait a second, but when I count the layers, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So my previous calculation up to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it using the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Wait, no, actually, in our earlier calculation, Layer 1 was the innermost, so perhaps the numbering is from the innermost to the outermost. Let me clarify: If Layer 1 is the innermost, then Layer 9 is the outermost. Therefore, the value at Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form solution, confirming that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364 is 1092, so adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 1093*3. Well, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the step-by-step computation from the innermost layer outwards gives me the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   Compute the innermost expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 1:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 2:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 3:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 4:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 5:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 6:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 7:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   Use the result from Layer 8:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Expression:**  \n    Multiply the result from Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me recompute Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that more carefully. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, it's probably faster to compute each step as I did before. However, for completeness, let's try to find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 =4, and the outermost is Layer 9, which would be a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the final result would be 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The outermost layer is multiplied by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
