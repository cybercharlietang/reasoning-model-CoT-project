    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4, which would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, that's 1 + 3*40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4), so that's 1 + 3*121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5), which is 1 + 3*364.\n\nLet me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6), so that's 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). That's 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), so that's 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9000 first, which is 27000, then 3*841 is 2523. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me verify that calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524*3 directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nNo more digits, so write down the carried over 2.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my layers. Let me check each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds upon the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the results are used in the subsequent layers. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   Compute the innermost expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   Substitute Layer 1 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   Substitute Layer 2 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   Substitute Layer 3 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   Substitute Layer 4 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   Substitute Layer 5 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   Substitute Layer 6 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   Substitute Layer 7 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost):**  \n   Substitute Layer 8 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times the Layer 9 result. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again: 29524 *3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 *3 = 60000\n- 9000 *3 = 27000\n- 500 *3 = 1500\n- 20 *3 = 60\n- 4 *3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, that was 1 +3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step might be more straightforward. Let me try another approach to confirm. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4. Then, a_{n}=1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_1 through a_9. Let me list them:\n\na1 = 1 +3 =4\n\na2 =1 +3*a1=1+12=13\n\na3=1 +3*a2=1+39=40\n\na4=1 +3*a3=1+120=121\n\na5=1 +3*a4=1+363=364\n\na6=1 +3*a5=1+1092=1093\n\na7=1 +3*a6=1+3279=3280\n\na8=1 +3*a7=1+9840=9841\n\na9=1 +3*a8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the previous result. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence relation? Let's see. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say D. Plugging into the recurrence: D =1 +3*D => D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply initial condition a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a9, n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step to see if I made any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, all the layers check out. So, I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing L9, I need to multiply it by 3. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 29524 * 3. I can compute this by breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding them up step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication because I might have made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, I can compute it directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is what I got before. So, maybe I was correct. Let me confirm using another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I miscalculated one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total is 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total is 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{part} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Each layer was computed correctly, the formula was applied, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem.

Let me calculate 3*13, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. So far, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or if I need to compute each layer step by step. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1093*3. Let's break that down: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me recompute Layer 9: Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. We can compute each term step by step, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, that aligns with my previous calculations. Alternatively, this recursive relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's plug the general solution into the recurrence to find A and B. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 3A + B = 4, and since B = -1/2, we have 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that: a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it matches. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 =3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2 =9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2 =29524. Correct. So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and ultimately compute the entire expression. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe it's better to compute from the inside out, so I can substitute each layer into the next one. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. So Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the entire expression equals 88,572. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " Maybe I can write each layer as a function of the previous one. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3 * L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3 * L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me write this down more formally. Let me define a recursive relation. Let's say L_n = 1 + 3 * L_{n-1}, where L1 = 4. So, starting from L1, each subsequent layer is calculated using this formula. Let me compute each layer step by step up to L9. L1 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, when I computed up to L9, which is 29524, does that mean the entire expression is 3 * L9? Because the outermost layer is 3 times the ninth layer. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, yes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer. So, if L9 is 29524, then the total expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers. Let me verify each step. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me explore that approach to confirm. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, that's 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and going up to Layer 9, which is the one inside the outermost 3(...). So, yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me think again. Each time, I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then multiplying by 3 at the end. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in computing 3^{10}. Let's compute 3^10 step by step: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This is similar to a geometric series, but each term is nested. Let me see if I can represent this as a sum. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with nine layers. Wait, but I think we've already computed this as 88572. Alternatively, since we have a closed-form expression for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 = 29524, and E = 3*L_9 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form solution L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Define Layers:** Let L_n represent the value of the nth layer from the innermost. Thus:\n   - L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Continue this up to L_9.\n\n3. **Recurrence Relation:** Each layer follows L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\n4. **Solve Recurrence:** The general solution for L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n5. **Compute L_9:** Plugging n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. **Final Expression:** Multiply L_9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can create a table where each row represents a layer, and I compute each one step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1093*3. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a minute, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So the total expression evaluates to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the multiplication for Layer 9 again because that's a big number. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. Then 29524 *3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each preceding one adds another layer. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then Layer 2: (1+3*(Layer 1)). Then Layer 3: (1+3*(Layer 2)), and so on until Layer 9. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc., up to 9 layers because there are nine sets of parentheses. So yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time adding a new layer. So my calculation of 88572 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear equation. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n*a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, starting from a_1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So the general formula for a_n would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me test for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write down the first few terms: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3 =1 +3*13=40. a_4=1 +3*40=121. a_5=1 +3*121=364. a_6=1 +3*364=1093. a_7=1 +3*1093=3280. a_8=1 +3*3280=9841. a_9=1 +3*9841=29524. So the sequence is 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so the solution should be of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSo 3A =4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the formula gives a_9=29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n represent the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, then Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nFor example, Layer 4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches.\n\nLayer 5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3 times that is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me write each layer and compute its value as I go. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute it again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I should do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n________\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Write down 7, carryover 2.\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should result in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me do it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNow, there are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 2? Wait, no, 29524 is 5 digits, so after the 2\u00d73, we're done. Wait, but 2\u00d73=6, plus carryover 2 is 8. So, the digits are 8, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that would be 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. Okay, so my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check again to be absolutely sure. Maybe I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 in another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method to cross-verify. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nGreat, so the closed-form formula works perfectly with the values I calculated earlier. That gives me more confidence that my step-by-step computation was correct. Now, the problem asks for 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3  \n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3  \n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12  \n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572  \n\nYes, that still adds up to 88572. Alternatively, I can compute it directly:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n---------  \n88572  \n\nStarting from the right:  \n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8.  \nSo, the result is 88572. Perfect, that matches my previous result. So, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.

Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So the total expression evaluates to 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it might make sense. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the outermost 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Maybe if I compute each layer and substitute it into the next one, I can work my way outwards. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let me break it down: 3*29,000 is 87,000. 3*524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, that seems high, but let me check again. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me verify each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth layer instead of computing each one step by step. Let me consider that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works for all layers up to n=9.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(L_9). But according to the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), and each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(previous layer). Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Let's see: Each time we have a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer out adds another 1+3*(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 1+3(...) terms, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, because each time we add another layer, so the total number of layers is 9. So, L_9 is the outermost layer, and the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, that would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, but just computed each layer step by step, I still arrived at the same result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nSo, I think I've solved it correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost layer is \\(3 \\times 29524\\). Calculating this:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding those together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280, correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524, correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, as I had before. Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe I should check each layer again to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might make the computation easier without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Because 3^{n+1}/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That seems correct.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for each layer up to n=9.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression, which is layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects me to compute it step by step, so let's make sure I didn't make any errors in the step-by-step computation.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression as a geometric series, maybe I can find another way to compute it. Let me try that.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nBut actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous layer.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but each term is 3^n, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the closed-form formula, I can use that to compute the result directly.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since it's straightforward.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572 as the final answer, but let me just verify once more.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n3*3=9 +2=11.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see:\n\nIf I expand the expression, each time I have 1 + 3*(...), so expanding each layer would give me a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's try expanding a few layers to see the pattern.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 3*3 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2 was 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is the sum up to 3^2.\n\nWait, but Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1 = 4.\n\nWait, so perhaps each layer n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^n.\n\nBut wait, for Layer 1: n=1, sum is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, sum is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is equivalent to 1 + 3*(sum up to previous power). So, perhaps each layer is the sum of a geometric series.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series up to n terms is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, the sum is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I think the way I did it before is sufficient.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3\\) times the result of Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Wait, 4, 13, 40... Hmm, not sure about a numerical pattern yet. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3; so 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, that seems pretty big. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Let me check 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did each step correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Because the outermost part is 3 times the whole thing.\n\nSo, the final step is:\n\nResult = 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let me break it down:\n\n3 * 29524 = 3 * (29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524\n\n3*29000 = 87000\n\n3*524: Let's compute 3*500=1500, 3*24=72, so 1500+72=1572\n\nNow, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, is that correct?

Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is defined by L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but wait, that formula is for when the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. However, in our case, a=3 and b=1, so the homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L9 is when n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the given problem with 9 layers, the innermost value is computed and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the next nested term. This can be represented as \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   The recurrence \\( L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1 \\) has the general solution \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the Innermost Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer, \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Iteratively Compute Each Layer:**\n   Using the recurrence relation, compute each subsequent layer up to \\( L_9 \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer \\( L_9 \\) by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, 3 times 29524. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way.

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and each time I'm just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression, maybe? Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nFirst, the recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1\n\n-2*L_p = 1\n\nL_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula seems to hold. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince our outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 manually to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, L_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations.\n\n1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Defined each layer as L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\n3.

    "text": " Maybe I should start with the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let's define each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is the Layer 9 expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire value would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me calculate that:\n\n29524 * 3:\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524*3 more carefully:\n\n29524\nx     3\n------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but maybe I made a mistake in the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the answer should be 88572. But wait, I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1 and Layer 2\n\nThen, 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 3\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is at the end, then each preceding layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parentheses.\n\nLet me try to count the number of layers by the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 9 layers of 1+3(...) and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But let me check again because sometimes when I'm counting layers, I might miscount. Let me try to compute each layer again step by step to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut I'm a bit concerned because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 9 layers seems like a lot, and the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression because computing each layer manually might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a_9 where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just cross-verify using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression.\n\nWait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and we've already solved it using the method above, so I think it's correct.\n\nLet me check the value again:\n\n3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed each layer step by step, I got 29524 for Layer 9, and then 3*29524=88572. But when I count the number of layers, I think I might have miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3 followed by another parentheses, so starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each time you add another layer, so from 1+3 up to 9 layers. So, the formula using n=9 gives a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to model this. Let me consider the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider that each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I define E_k as the value of the expression with k layers, then E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, with E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculations. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the number seems quite large. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that might give me the same result without computing each layer.\n\nAs I derived earlier, the general formula for E_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, the expression is multiplied by 3 and adds 1, so after 9 layers, the value would be something like 3^10 - 1 divided by 2, but I think that's similar to what I've already done.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer adds a power of 3. Let me see:\n\nE_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nE_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\nE_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n...\nE_k = 3^k + 3^{k-1} + ... + 3 + 1 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nWhich is exactly the formula I used earlier. So, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, and each time I arrive at the same answer. So, I feel confident that the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should compute Layer 1 first: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, that's 13. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, that's 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524*3. Breaking it down: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3 = 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems quite large. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I went too fast through the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to see if I messed up any numbers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, reading from the top: 6, 8, 8, 5, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, 29524*3=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just verify once more. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see if this is a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer and see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me avoid computing all nine layers manually. Let's start with the innermost layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2: 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. I can compute this by breaking it down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly.

Let me write down each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I'm wondering if I did each layer correctly. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so I think I accounted for all of them. Let me recount: starting from the innermost, each time I have a 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another multiplication. So, 9 layers in total, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression without having to compute each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, right? So, maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula should still hold. Let me recall the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. For a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n-1} * L_1 + b*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. But in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K.\n\nApplying the initial condition, say at n=1: L_1 = 4 = C*a^1 + K = C*3 + K. But K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor Layer 1 (n=1): (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2 (n=2): (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3 (n=3): (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4 (n=4): (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5 (n=5): (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6 (n=6): (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7 (n=7): (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8 (n=8): (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9 (n=9): (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nWow, so the formula works perfectly. Therefore, each layer n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to confirm that I get the same result. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, compute 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also worked fine. But recognizing the pattern and using the formula saved me time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miss any layers, let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the initial 3: each \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each with an opening parenthesis, which matches the layers I computed. So, I didn't miss any. Good.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I started with Layer 1 as 1+3, which is the innermost, and then each subsequent layer added another 3*(previous). So, I think I accounted for all 9 layers correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let me see if that makes sense. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to express it that way.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. Let me denote S as the sum inside the innermost parentheses. Wait, but actually, each layer is built upon the previous one, so maybe it's better to model it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, if I write it out, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers. So, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is a sum that can be represented as a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms.\n\nWait, but actually, each term is not just 3^n, because each term also adds 1. So, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, starting from 1 and going up to 9 terms, but with each term being multiplied by 3^(n). Hmm, maybe I can express the innermost sum as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try to write the entire expression in terms of a sum. Let's denote the innermost expression as S_1 = 1 + 3. Then S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1, S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2, and so on up to S_9. Then the total expression is 3*S_9.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, each S_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and the total expression is 3*S_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, then divided by 2 is 88572. That's the same result as before. So, this alternative approach also gives me 88572.\n\nWait, so is there a general formula for such expressions? It seems like when you have a nested expression of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + ...)), it can be expressed as a geometric series. In this case, a=1 and b=3. The number of layers is 9, so the expression inside the outermost 3 is S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as starting with the outermost 3, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the expression inside is S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I can generalize this. If I have n layers of 1 + 3*(...), then the innermost sum S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_n, which would be 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn this problem, n=9, so it's (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've verified this result multiple ways: by computing each layer step by step, by using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula for a geometric series, and by generalizing the expression to a formula involving exponents of 3. All methods lead to the same result, which is 88572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, I can compute 3^{11} manually:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144, and 177144 divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all possible ways to compute this. I can't find any errors in my reasoning, and all methods converge to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2.

Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Hmm, but let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, so each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear, so perhaps I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me set up the equation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since the outermost layer is Layer 9, the value inside the outermost parentheses is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, yes, L_9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps and verified each layer, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer and then finding a pattern helped a lot. I also used the recurrence relation method to confirm the result, which gave me the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct result for this expression.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is straightforward. So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2: 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. So that's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let's do that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to compute it directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. 0*3=0. So writing that out: 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 9*3=27, but wait, maybe I should write it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\nBut wait, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as follows:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nWait, this seems like it's not ending. Maybe I'm miscounting the digits. Let me count the digits in 29524. It's a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So, when multiplying by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again more carefully:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n- Since there are no more digits, add the carryover: 2.\n\nSo, writing the result from top to bottom: 2 (from the carryover), then 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 277572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, right? Wait, maybe I'm confusing the digits. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\nNow, there are no more digits, so we add the carryover 2 at the beginning.\n\nSo the result is 277572? Wait, that can't be because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, which is a 5-digit number. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me compute it correctly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units digit: 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit: 7.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds digit: 5, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Thousands digit: 7.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Ten-thousands digit: 7, carryover 2.\n- Since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 to the next higher place, making it 27.\n\nWait, so the result is 277572? But that's a 6-digit number, which seems too big. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's break it down as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that makes sense. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, so earlier, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me correct that:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 to the next higher place, which would be the ten-thousands place. So the result is 27 (from the carryover) followed by 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 277572, but that's not correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. I think I'm getting confused with the placement. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since we've reached the end, we add the carryover 2 to the next higher digit, which is the ten-thousands place. So, the result is 2 (from carryover) followed by 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 277572, but that's incorrect. I must be making a mistake in the placement.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 to the left side. So the result is 277572. But wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88572. I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me compute it another way. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, so to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed step by step, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, working outward. After computing each layer up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, I then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's correct, but let me double-check by computing the expression step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer starting from the innermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large, but maybe that's correct. Let me check my computations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying the outermost 3 by Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the multiplication again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but the problem was written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers. Did I count correctly? Let me check the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI count nine sets of (1+3(...)), so Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nYes, nine layers. So, my computation up to Layer 9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check if this formula holds for the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but that's breaking it down, but perhaps adding up:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000; 60000+27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500; 87000+1500=88500\n\n20*3=60; 88500+60=88560\n\n4*3=12; 88560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nSo, 3*L_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the value of each layer and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Define the recurrence relation**: Let L_n be the value of the nth layer. The relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the recurrence**: The general solution is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the final result**: Multiply L_9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Maybe if I compute each layer starting from the innermost, it'll build up correctly. Let me write this out step by step. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let's see: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let's go through each layer again to verify. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since I was able to compute each layer without any errors, I think 88572 is the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), and this process is repeated nine times.

    "text": " Maybe I should start with the innermost expression and work my way outwards. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364. So, 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093. So, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280. So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841. So, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nI notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a linear recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n.\n\nThe particular solution is L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = a*K + b.\n\nSolving for K: K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a).\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Here, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = C*a^1 + K = C*a + K = 4.\n\nWe know K = b/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, plugging into the equation for n=1:\n\nC*3 + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*3^{10} = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by computing the innermost parentheses first, then work my way outwards. So, let's start with the innermost part: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let's see, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... let's compute that: 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3, so 2400 + 120 + 3 = 2523. So, 3*9841 is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing quite rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any multiplication errors. Let me verify a few layers again. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer and then substitute the value into the next layer. Let's try that. Starting with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Hmm, but wait, let me verify the multiplication for 3*29524 again to be absolutely sure. 29524 multiplied by 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.

So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, is the answer 88,572? Hmm, wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so total 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29,524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Because each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Maybe there's a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, these numbers look familiar. Let me see if they relate to powers of 3 or something similar.\n\nCompute powers of 3:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nHmm, not directly matching. But let's see the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nWait, 3*4=12, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nWait, let me see if each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with our earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). But wait, Layer 1 corresponds to n=9? Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the innermost expression is Layer 9: 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the outermost layer is Layer 1, which is 3*(Layer 2). Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is Layer 9, and each layer wraps around, so Layer 1 is the outermost, which is 3*(Layer 2). Wait, no, actually, in my initial breakdown, I labeled the innermost as Layer 9, then Layer 8, etc., up to Layer 1 being the outermost. So, in that case, Layer 1 corresponds to n=9 in the formula. Wait, no, because in the formula, n=1 was the innermost, but in the problem, the innermost is Layer 9. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the innermost layer is Layer 1, then the next is Layer 2, up to Layer 9 being the outermost. But in the problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., down to Layer 9: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, perhaps in the formula, n=1 corresponds to Layer 9, n=2 to Layer 8, etc., up to n=9 corresponding to Layer 1. Therefore, Layer 1 (the outermost) would correspond to n=9 in the formula.\n\nSo, Layer 1 (outermost) = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each Layer n corresponds to the nth level from the innermost, then Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, etc., up to Layer 9 being 29524, and the entire expression is 3*Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is the outermost. So, perhaps my initial labeling was correct, with Layer 1 being the outermost, Layer 9 being the innermost. Therefore, Layer 1 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and start from the innermost parentheses.\n2. Compute each layer sequentially:\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer from the inside out and see if there's a pattern or a formula that emerges. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Innermost Layer (Layer 9, maybe? Wait, actually, the innermost is the last one, so perhaps it's Layer 1, and we work our way up. Wait, maybe I should index them from the inside out. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. Let me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nWait, that seems too simple. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the total would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572, so adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result is 88572. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There's one after each 1, so let's see: each time it's 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: from the innermost to the outermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time we add another layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3 times a term that starts with 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent term adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 1 + 3(, and each time it's nested. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" segments. Let me see:\n\n- The first is 3(1 + 3(...))\n- Then inside that, it's 1 + 3(1 + 3(...))\n- So, each time, it's another 1 + 3(...)\n\nLet me count the number of times the pattern \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times the 1 + 3 occurs inside the parentheses. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then each layer outwards adds another 1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, that's one, then each time we go out, another layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost term is 3*(...), so that would correspond to Layer 9, which we've computed as 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut let me verify my calculations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Let me check each multiplication:\n\n3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct.\n\n3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct.\n\n3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct.\n\n3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct.\n\n3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\n3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\n3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\n3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\n3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large quickly, and sometimes when you have a geometric progression, you might have a formula that can compute the sum without having to calculate each layer. Let me see if there's a pattern here that can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3*1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n\nIt seems each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps it can help us compute the nth term without iterating each time.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. That's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3 times a term that has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the formula we used is correct, with n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we compute the 9th layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Calculation:** Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = ?\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but did I compute all the layers correctly?

Each layer's computation checks out when I go through them again. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this easier without computing each layer step by step. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure: each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier, computing each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time in the future. Let's try to derive that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n = 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn =3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, corresponds to n=1, and the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = 29524, as I calculated before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Maybe I should compute the innermost first. Let's define Layer 1 as the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together, it's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 by breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, 3*(Layer 9) is indeed 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in computation. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 2:1+12=13, Layer 3:1+39=40, Layer 4:1+120=121, Layer 5:1+363=364, Layer 6:1+1092=1093, Layer 7:1+3279=3280, Layer 8:1+9840=9841, Layer 9:1+29523=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here because each step builds on the previous one, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end.

    "text": " Maybe I should compute the innermost parentheses first and work my way out. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in the steps. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also seems accurate. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.

Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me check if I did each layer correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back and check each layer computation step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are nine instances of 1+3(...). So, that's nine layers. So, my earlier computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, with Layer 9 being the outermost one. So, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large so quickly, but each step seems correct. Let me try computing a smaller version to see if my approach is right. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) with three layers. Let's compute that manually:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. Correct. Now, let's compute it with my method:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my approach works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should give the correct result. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when numbers get big, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that again. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 was 364, so 3*364 is 1,092. Then, 1 + 1,092 is indeed 1,093. Okay, that's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000. 93*3=279. So, 3,000 + 279=3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279=3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000. 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840=9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840=9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3=27,000. 800*3=2,400. 40*3=120. 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400=29,400. 29,400 + 120=29,520. 29,520 +3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, just to see if I get the same result. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step seems to follow logically from the previous one. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is... Wait, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me recheck 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, total 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, total 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, total 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3.

So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I believe the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute one or two layers again to confirm. Let's recompute Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. How about Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280.

So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems accurate. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I could solve it using the formula for such a sequence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so r = 3 and c = 1. The initial term a_1 = 4. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, actually, since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, maybe the initial term is a_0 = 1. Let me think. If I consider a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. The closed-form solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=0: (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads to the same answer, which confirms that the earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for errors. Let's recompute Layer 3: Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
