So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote the value of the nth layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each layer manually. That's pretty cool. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me verify one more layer with the formula. Let's take n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. Perfect. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280.

The original expression is 3 times this Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, the final result should be 88572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering how each layer is tripling the previous one and adding 1, it might make sense. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c = 3, d = 1. The initial term a_1 = 4. Hmm, but the standard formula is for a_0. Let me adjust it. If I consider a_1 as the first term, then perhaps the formula can be adapted. Let me try to compute a few terms using the recurrence to see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each a_n is 3 times the previous a_{n-1} plus 1. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear combination. The homogeneous solution is when d = 0, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = a_1*3^{n-1}. The particular solution when d \u2260 0 is a constant solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer triples the previous value and adds 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. If there were more layers, I might consider a different approach, perhaps using geometric series or recursion, but for nine layers, step-by-step seems manageable. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of terms is small, computing each term step by step is feasible. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1, a_1 = 4. If I plug into the formula: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1. Hmm, that's not matching. So, maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps a different formula applies here. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives the value of each layer. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to generalize it, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. However, if there were more layers, a formula might be more efficient. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches L_2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches L_3. Great, the formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same answer. This method might be more efficient for larger numbers of layers, but for 9 layers, either method works fine. I think I've verified it thoroughly. The answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, is that the final answer? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

Hmm, that seems right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is built upon the previous one. Let me consider the general form of such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). Each layer is a + b*(previous layer). This kind of expression can sometimes be represented using the formula for a geometric series, but since it's finite, we might need to compute each term step by step. Alternatively, perhaps we can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say L1 = 1 + 3 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... and so on, up to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. Each term depends on the previous one, multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations to see if it holds. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can derive the solution efficiently. The expression simplifies to 3 times the ninth term of a sequence defined by L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Substituting n=9 gives L_9 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check if this pattern holds for the next layers. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, so Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 1, so Layer 9 is the expression inside the outermost parentheses. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications. Let me recompute 29524*3: 29524 *3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572 is correct. Wait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(next layer). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that would be nine layers, meaning Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, yes, I have correctly calculated up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. But wait, that seems quite large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, we can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me write that down: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, and since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, the solution will be of the form L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence relation into this form. Assuming L_n = A*3^n + B, then L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1=4. So, plug n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. We can factor this as L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers, so it's likely correct. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods give the same answer, which makes me confident that 88572 is correct. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 equals 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Hmm, 121. That's interesting. Let me check that again: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yep, that's correct. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 121 * 3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88,572. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3 * 13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3 * 40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3 * 121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Starting with the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. So, each layer seems to be building up more. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a minute, hold on. I think I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count: Starting from the innermost, each time I add a layer, so the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 wraps around that, Layer 3 wraps around Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, same result. Maybe that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions with repeated multiplication like this can sometimes be represented using geometric series or other recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as Layer n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving such recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is given by L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 1. So, the general solution would be L_n = 3^n * C + 1/(1 - 3) = 3^n * C - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = 3^1 * C - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C:\n\n3C - 1/2 = 4\n3C = 4 + 1/2\n3C = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3^n)*(3/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3, L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my previous calculation. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nThus, the expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nBut since the problem was to compute the given expression, and I've verified it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to see if it's consistent.\n\nFor example, Layer 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, I can trust that Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nTo verify, we use the formula for the general solution of the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\). The solution is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\):\n\n- \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n\nThus, the entire expression is:\n\n- \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is growing quite a bit. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or maybe a formula to make this easier, but for now, I'll just compute each layer step by step. Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, wait a minute, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the whole nested thing. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break this down. 29524 times 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nFinally, 2 (the leftmost digit) *3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 has 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when I multiply by 3:\n\n4*3=12, units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, tens place is 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, ten thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: 29524*3. Let me compute this another way to verify. 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let's add those: 87000 + 1572. 87000 + 1000 = 88000. 88000 + 572 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the total expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any of them.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a second. The expression seems to be a geometric series in disguise. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, is L_1 = 4, as we saw. But in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, as before. So, using the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me expand this expression step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write E as 3*(1 + 3*A), where A is the next nested expression. But this might not lead me anywhere quickly. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since it's a finite nesting, it's not an infinite series, so maybe that approach isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps I can write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but since it's finite, it's better to compute each layer as I did earlier. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculations. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nMultiply by 3:88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value of each layer efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the innermost layer and then compute the entire expression by multiplying by 3. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time, we're taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or maybe even a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. But for now, let's continue step by step to make sure I understand the process correctly. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final result is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nLet me verify each step again to be sure. It's easy to make an arithmetic mistake, especially with so many layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3 * 29524: As computed earlier, that's 88572. Correct.\n\nWait a second, I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we're looking for 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it by iteration or by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as 1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2}) =1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this expansion, it becomes a sum of 3^k from k=0 to n, minus some terms. Wait, actually, using the formula for a geometric series might not directly apply here, but since we've already found a closed-form solution, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nIn any case, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and then applying the final multiplication by 3, we arrived at the result of 88572. Additionally, by solving the recurrence relation, we confirmed that the result is indeed correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified the computations thoroughly. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next layer. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. So, writing it out: 6 (from 2*3), then 27, but we need to carry over the tens. Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition to find B.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also consider the steady-state solution, which is when L_n = L_{n-1} = L. So,\n\nL = 1 + 3L\n\nSolving for L:\n\nL = 1 + 3L\n\nSubtract 3L from both sides:\n\n-2L = 1\n\nSo, L = -1/2.\n\nBut in our case, L_n is increasing, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, which we found to be -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is L_9, is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^{10} is 59049.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be seen as a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an additional constant term added each time, which complicates it a bit. However, as we saw earlier, the closed-form solution can be derived, confirming the result.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine layers, so we'll compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1. a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier when I computed layer by layer. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, divide by 2: 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms the answer again. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It was a bit of a lengthy computation, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped ensure that I didn't make any mistakes. I also thought about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify the process, and it turns out there is, which made me feel better about the answer. So, I think I'm done here.

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a jump. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Wow, that's getting big. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such large numbers. Starting from Layer 1 up: Layer 1: 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524: Let me do this multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 48 + 24 = 72. So, 70000 + 18000 = 88000, plus 72 is 88072. Wait, that's different from what I got before. Earlier, I thought it was 88572, but now I'm getting 88072. Hmm, that means I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me check where I went wrong. In my first calculation, I broke down 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, multiplied each by 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88072. Clearly, there's a discrepancy. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to confirm. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, that's the same as my first calculation. But when I added 29524 +29524 +29524, I must have made a mistake. Let me add them again. 29524 + 29524: Let's add units place: 4+4=8, tens: 2+2=4, hundreds:5+5=10, thousands:9+9=18, ten-thousands:2+2=4. So, 29524 +29524: 48048? Wait, no. Wait, let's do it properly. Let me write it down:\n\n  29524\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1\n9 + 9 = 18 +1 =19, write down 9, carryover 1\n2 + 2 =4 +1=5\nSo, 29524 +29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add the third 29524:\n\n59048 +29524.\n\nLet's add:\n\n8 +4=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n4 +2=6 +1=7\n0 +5=5\n9 +9=18, write down 8, carryover 1\n5 +2=7 +1=8\nSo, 59048 +29524 =88572.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, my initial addition was wrong when I thought I got 88072. Actually, it's 88572. So, my first calculation was correct. Therefore, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be absolutely sure. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I arrive at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. To recap, each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from 4, each subsequent layer was significantly larger, which is why the numbers jumped so much. It's important to compute each step carefully to avoid mistakes, especially with such large numbers. But by breaking it down and taking it one layer at a time, I was able to reach the solution without getting overwhelmed.\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is to recognize that it's a geometric series or perhaps follows a recursive pattern. Let me explore that angle to see if it confirms my answer. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, and then each subsequent term is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. So, a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a\u2099.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a\u2081=4. Wait, actually, in our case, a\u2081=4 corresponds to n=1. So, let's write it as a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, a\u2081 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099= (3/2)*3\u207f -1/2= (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a\u2099= (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2.\n\nSo, a\u2099= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089=3*29524=88572, which matches my previous calculation. So, this method confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time I compute the innermost expression first and work my way out. This is essentially the same approach I took initially, just formalized.\n\nIt's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allows me to find a closed-form solution, which can be more efficient than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were much larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nI also considered whether there might be a mistake in my initial multiplication when I saw the discrepancy in the addition method. It taught me the importance of verifying my work through different methods, especially when dealing with large numbers where arithmetic errors can easily occur.\n\nIn summary, by carefully computing each nested layer step by step and then cross-verifying using a different mathematical approach (recurrence relations), I arrived at the solution confidently. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Starting with the innermost Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did all the steps correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each part step by step without getting lost. It took a while, but breaking it down made it manageable.

    "text": " Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1,092. Then, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Layer 6 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1,093, so 3*1,093 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3,280, so 3*3,280 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Layer 8 is 9,841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9,841, so 3*9,841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So Layer 9 is 29,524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29,524. Hmm, let's compute that step by step. 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So that gives us 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry over 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88,572. So the total value of the expression is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364.

Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each one. But just for practice, maybe I can see if there's a pattern. Let's see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see, the recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's consistent. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, we get 88,572. So the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, yeah, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...).

Hmm, that's interesting. Let's go to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Thus, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841.

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), n times. Then, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote the nth layer as L_n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. Then, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. So, the general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88,572. So, both methods agree, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from L_1=4, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, expanding this, L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each term adds another 3^k, where k is the depth. So, for n layers, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but that would be a geometric series sum. Wait, let's see: L_1=1+3=4=3^0 + 3^1.\n\nL_2=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=13=3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, L_3=1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40=3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nAh, so in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the same formula we derived earlier. Therefore, L_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from k=0 to k=n. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. So, that's another way to approach it. Either way, the answer is the same. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time, we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me check if I'm doing this right.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct.

Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems correct. But let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, to confirm that my step-by-step computation is accurate. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using recursion. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a recursive relation. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, I can try to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is linear and non-homogeneous. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which makes me more confident that this is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me explore that approach as well. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next inner layer. If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this out in expanded form. Starting from the innermost part: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. But perhaps another way to see this is that each time we add a new layer, we're effectively adding another term in a geometric progression. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let's denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, the number of layers is nine, starting from the innermost 1 + 3 up to the outermost. So, perhaps E can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with eight 3's multiplied. Wait, no, let me think. Each time you go out a layer, you add another 3*(...). So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is the ninth layer. But since we already have a formula for L_n, maybe we can use that to compute E directly. So, E = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to get there using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same result. Either way, the answer seems to be 88572. But just to make sure, let me verify the computation for each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, all these steps check out. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Let me verify Layer 9 again: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, another way to compute 29524*3 is to do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me go through each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Everything checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting, it's increasing quite a bit. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, I think my calculations are correct.

Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding up: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279. 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my steps, so I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Because the whole thing is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Let me check with a different approach to make sure. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just to confirm, let's see if there's a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our layers go from 1 to 9, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, the total is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series in disguise. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me think about how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of 3s multiplied together. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. Each time, the number of 3s increases by one. Wait, actually, the expression can be written as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: If I have n layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to generalize it. Let me denote the expression with k layers as E_k. Then, E_k = 3*(1 + E_{k-1}), where E_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, E_1 would be the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Then E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on. But in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(E_9), where E_9 is 1 + 3*E_8, and so on. So, to model this correctly, let's define E_k as the expression starting from the k-th layer. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... up to E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8. Then, the total expression is 3*E_9. So, my earlier calculation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for E_k. Let's see if there's a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let me list the values again: E_1 = 4 E_2 = 13 E_3 = 40 E_4 = 121 E_5 = 364 E_6 = 1093 E_7 = 3280 E_8 = 9841 E_9 = 29524 Now, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent E_k. Let me see the ratio between consecutive terms. 13 / 4 = 3.25 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077 121 / 40 = 3.025 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000 So, it seems like as k increases, E_k approaches a ratio of 3. That makes sense because each term is defined as E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write the recurrence relation: E_k = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, with E_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E_k - 3*E_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E_k^{(h)} = C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_k^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with k=1: E_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: E_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: E_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for k=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3*29524 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Either way, it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using powers of 3.

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 4 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, and 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let me break this down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the entire Layer 9 expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total is 88,572.

Now, the final step is to multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem that might confirm my answer? Maybe using a formula for a geometric series or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly for each layer. That gives me more confidence that my step-by-step computation was correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} is 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, checked each computation, then used a recurrence relation to find a general formula, verified it with the computed values, and then used that formula to compute the final result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty confident that 88,572 is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n3. Notice the recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula.\n4. Use the formula to compute the final result and confirm it matches the step-by-step computation.\n5. Double-check using an alternative method (direct computation of 3*a_9 and using the exponent formula).\n\nThis systematic approach helps prevent errors and ensures that I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's especially useful for problems with repetitive structures or nested expressions because it allows breaking the problem into manageable parts.\n\nI think I'm satisfied with this solution. It makes sense, and both methods confirm the same answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with 88,572 as the final result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Starting with the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2: 13 Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40 Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121 Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Let me go through each layer again briefly. Layer 1: 1+3=4 (correct). Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 (correct). Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 (correct). Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 (correct). Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 (correct). Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me model it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we have a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient and less error-prone. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building up a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, since each term is nested, it's more of a recursive geometric progression. Either way, the formula we derived gives the correct result. So, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression with 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up exponentially. Ultimately, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be written as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find B first. If I assume that L_n approaches a steady state where L_n = L_{n-1} = L, then L = 3L + 1 => -2L = 1 => L = -1/2. Hmm, but our layers are all positive, so maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Let's say Layer 1 is L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with Layer 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the opening parentheses: Starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I have 1+3(...), so let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, actually, each time I go out a layer, I add another 1+3(...). So, in the expression, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nSo, that's nine opening parentheses, meaning nine layers. So, my initial count was correct, nine layers. So, computing up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, more carefully, to avoid any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this using another method to confirm. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(term from the next layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's test this. Let's assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term.

    "text": " Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay. Let's keep going. Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, we have 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Let me check the original problem again. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the expression becomes 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, which seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers again to confirm. Let's recompute Layers 1 through 3: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Yep, that's consistent. How about Layers 7 and 8? Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I can find a pattern instead. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 As I saw earlier, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with a_1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. This might have saved some time, especially if the number of layers was larger, but since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation wasn't too bad. In summary, by breaking down the problem from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value step by step and then verify it using a formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363.

Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me verify that. Each step seems correct, but let me double-check a couple of layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right.

Next layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, that's getting big. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 That's a big number. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Wow, this is increasing rapidly. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Okay, 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = ? Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Wait, let me check that again. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Finally, 3 * 29,524: Let's compute it again. 29,524 * 3. Break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication and addition, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The standard approach for solving such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. That's the same result as before. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved me from computing each layer manually, which was time-consuming and prone to error. It's a good reminder that recognizing patterns and using mathematical tools can simplify complex-looking problems. I think I'm confident now that the answer is indeed 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach led me to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost one. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363.

Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches my previous result. So, the total is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer computation again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all layers check out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, to cross-verify my result.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. Now, the problem has 9 layers, so n=9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to expand a few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 108 = 121\n\nHmm, I notice that each a_n can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\na_2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\na_3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\na_4 = 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nAh, I see! So, in general, a_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1 + 1. That's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^n.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, the series starts at 1 (which is 3^0) and goes up to 3^n, so the number of terms is n+1. Therefore, the sum S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_n is equal to this sum. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the geometric series formula\u2014lead to the same result. It's always reassuring to cross-verify using different approaches to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested and repetitive expression.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the nth term. Applying this, we determine the final value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Wait, that seems a bit bigger. Let me check that: 3*13 is indeed 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Hmm, 121? That's a nice number, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yeah, that's correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, 364. Let me keep going. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me check the multiplication again: 3*29524. Let's compute it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's the correct solution. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with 1 + 3, then using that result in the next layer, and so on, until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
