    "text": " Alternatively, if I had recognized the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. But since it's only 9 layers, computing each step was manageable. Either way, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just do a quick sanity check: If each layer is being multiplied by 3 and adding 1, starting from 4, then each subsequent layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense why the number gets so large. So, 3*(a bunch of layers) leads to a pretty big number, which 88572 is. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.
