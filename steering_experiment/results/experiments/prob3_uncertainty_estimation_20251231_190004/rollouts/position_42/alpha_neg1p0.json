Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

I think I handled each layer correctly, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1, which seems to follow the pattern in the problem.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Maybe I should recompute each layer to ensure accuracy. Let's go through them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute this multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 29524 as 29000 + 524. Then, 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. That's the same result.\n\nI think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the inside, and each time I substituted the result into the next layer. It's a bit tedious, but since the expression is finite, with only nine layers, it's manageable. If it were infinitely nested, I might have had to find a pattern or use a formula, but since it's finite, just computing each layer is straightforward.\n\nLet me also think about whether there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. If I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Yep, that works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, this formula is correct.\n\nSo, knowing this, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). This structure repeats nine times, with the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Define the Layers:**\n   Let \\(L_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost:\n   - \\(L_1 = 1 + 3\\)\n   - \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1\\)\n   - Continue up to \\(L_9\\).\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Recognize the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\). The general solution is \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n=9\\):\n   - \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\\)\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times L_9\\):\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me check my calculations again because 3*29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Let's go through each layer again carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That seems correct.) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct.) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct.) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct.) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct.) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct.) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct.) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying that by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, but when I did it earlier, I thought 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the final answer was 88572, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Wait, the original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first opening parenthesis after 3 is for Layer 1. Then, each additional ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3: There are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did before. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems like a large number. Maybe I should verify my calculations with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recursive relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{10} directly and see. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we're doing this nine times, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, equation 1: 3A + B = 4. Now, let's assume that for n >=1, a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plug B = -1/2 into equation 1: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to, I could have used the formula from the start without computing each layer. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers is larger. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, putting it all together: 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each time, I see an opening parenthesis after the 3. Let me count them: Starting from the first 3(, then each 3( adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...))))\n...\nContinuing until there are nine layers. Wait, actually, when I started computing, I had nine layers, but let me confirm how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3.

But wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, but when I labeled them, I only went up to Layer 9, which is correct because each opening parenthesis is a new layer. So, yes, 88,572 seems to be the correct answer. But let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 And so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 => A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Now, let's equate the terms: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused now because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip a layer or miscount.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, the pattern is 1 + 3(...), and each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... and so on until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of \"1+3(\", which would mean 9 layers. So, my initial count was correct, 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which we computed as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here, perhaps a geometric series or something else. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLooking at the recursion: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the exponentiation or division.\n\n3^10: Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the number is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also works.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's the correct answer then. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped a lot. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we find the solution using a closed-form formula. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 is actually 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So starting from Layer 1: 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, I think my computations are correct.

The original expression starts with 3*(...), so maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 times? Wait, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost, which is the 9th layer. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my initial computation was correct, with 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + C,\n\nwhere A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution.\n\nLet's find the particular solution. Assume that the particular solution is a constant, C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers. So, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some terms. But since each term is nested, it's not exactly a simple geometric series, but the recurrence approach seems to work.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds another power of 3. For example:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, indeed, each layer n corresponds to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again because sometimes when I'm dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or misapply the multiplication. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any or compute an extra one. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a new layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, we have nine instances of 1+3(...). Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, the first is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me parse the expression step by step. The innermost is 1+3, then moving out: each time, we have 1+3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1+3 as Layer 1, then 1+3*(Layer 1) is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the initial 3. So, yes, there are nine layers. So, my calculation of Layer 9 being 29524 and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572 should be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term manually. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms my earlier calculation. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step and then using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.

Let me check the multiplication another way to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, carryover 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards, which made the problem manageable step by step.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in multiplying or adding somewhere. Let me recompute Layer 9 and then the final multiplication. Layer 9 was computed as 1 + 3*9841. Let me check that: 3*9841: 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct. Now, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, same result. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 6 8 8 5 2. Wait, that's 68852? Wait, that doesn't match the previous result. Wait, did I do that right? Let me try again: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNo more digits, so write down the carryover if any, but here it's zero.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. Oh, I see, I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, 88572 is correct. So, my initial calculation was right. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula also leads me to the same answer, which reinforces that it's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value of the innermost term and then compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So when we multiply:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\nSo the result is 88,572. So, yes, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation instead of calculating each layer step by step. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a form of a geometric progression. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each previous layer. This is much more efficient, especially for larger n. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this value: 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might add incorrectly or multiply wrong. Let me verify each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.

Then multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. That seems correct. Hmm, so the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let's see. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, starting from the innermost, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. It might seem tedious to compute each layer step by step, but breaking it down like this helps prevent mistakes. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a formula, which is a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were much larger. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Just needed to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid arithmetic errors. So, in summary, by either method, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another term. There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.

Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nGiven that, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4.\n\nBut in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by iterative computation and by finding a closed-form formula, which gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524 Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me try that approach to verify. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our previous result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer.

So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that I can apply to verify this result without computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 more quickly. Let's see if there's a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my initial calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3*a_9 directly using the formula:\n\n3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=3*59049=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the final step is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since there are nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, I'll try computing one more layer using the formula to see if it aligns. Let's take Layer 4: According to the formula, L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is exactly what I got earlier. So, the formula is consistent. Therefore, the final answer should indeed be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Recognizing this pattern, we can derive a general formula for the nth layer as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). \n\nFor the innermost layer (Layer 1):\n\\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\nFollowing the recurrence relation up to Layer 9:\n\\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12.

Wait, actually, maybe I should just compute it as 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so I think I made a mistake in the digit places. Let me count the digits in 29524: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, putting it together: 87572.

Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3=12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, tens digit is 7.\nNext: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, so the result is 87572.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 88,572, but now it's 87,572. So I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me check again: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it another way: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 88,572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check which one is correct.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 * 3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.

So earlier, when I broke it down into 20000 + 9000 + etc., I got 88,572, which matches the digit-by-digit multiplication. So my initial mistake was probably in the digit alignment when I did the first digit-by-digit calculation. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because earlier I thought it was 87,572, but now it's 88,572. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 (hundreds place) *3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9 (thousands place) *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2 (ten thousands place) *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let's break it down again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage it without getting lost. I just had to remember to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way outward, making sure each step was correct before moving on to the next. It's like peeling an onion; each layer depends on the one inside it, so you can't skip ahead. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This seems similar to a geometric series or maybe a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. Let's try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let's compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed our step-by-step calculation. That's reassuring. It might have been faster to use the formula, especially if there were more layers, but for 9 layers, both methods worked. I think I understand the problem better now. It's a nested multiplication where each step depends on the previous one, and recognizing the pattern allowed me to solve it more efficiently. I guess the key takeaway here is that when faced with a complex nested expression, it's helpful to look for patterns or recurrence relations that can simplify the computation instead of brute-forcing each layer, especially if the expression is long. But in this case, since there were only nine layers, even computing each step manually wasn't too bad. Just needed to be careful with each arithmetic operation to avoid mistakes. I also realized the importance of verifying each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of operations. A small mistake in one layer could propagate and throw off the entire calculation, so double-checking each step is essential. Overall, it was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing recurrence relations. It might be useful in the future when dealing with similar problems, perhaps in computer science or other areas where recursive structures are common.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the ninth layer efficiently. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Derive the Closed-Form Formula:**\n   The general solution for the recurrence relation is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the Ninth Layer:**\n   \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps seem correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. Then, we can find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I'm done here. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I was able to derive a formula to compute the innermost layers efficiently without having to calculate each step manually. This approach reduces the chance of arithmetic errors and makes the problem more manageable, especially if the number of layers were larger.

So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me verify my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go back through each layer to check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check with a different approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the inner layer. So, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute the result without calculating each layer individually.\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where k starts from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express L_k as a function. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_k.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^k.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When k=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8, which is 88572.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I write the digits, it's 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 (from 2*3 +2), 8 (from 9*3 +1), 5 (from 5*3),7 (from 2*3 +1),2 (from 4*3). Wait, that would be 88572, which is correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully checking each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. But wait, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can simplify this computation instead of calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. Hmm, this looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4 For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's take Layer 4: L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. According to the formula, L_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Hmm, but I just thought of something. Let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3, I see that there are nine sets of parentheses. Each set corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, I correctly computed each layer up to the ninth one, which is the one before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, 29524 is the value before the final multiplication, and 88,572 is the result after that. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3n, where n is the result from the previous step. This seems similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result would be 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using standard techniques. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Another way to think about this is that each layer is essentially building a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit more involved. But using the recurrence relation and solving it gives a clear path to the solution. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it would have led me to the same answer. So, either way, I arrive at 88,572. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nBy evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$ with $a_1 = 4$. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, and computing up to the ninth layer results in $29524$. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying my calculations, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. Alternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yep, same result. So, my method works for a smaller version, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem. Therefore, I can conclude that the computed value is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.
