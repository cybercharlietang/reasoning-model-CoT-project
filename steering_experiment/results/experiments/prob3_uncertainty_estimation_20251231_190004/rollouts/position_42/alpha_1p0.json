    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to compute it directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the layers go up to a_9, and the final result is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can write the recurrence relation as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Wait, I think I'm getting lost here. Maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, and each closing parenthesis ends a layer. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the parentheses. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first. Then, moving outward, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3s. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1+3 (Layer 1) 2. 1+3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2) 3. 1+3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3) 4. 1+3*(Layer 3) (Layer 4) 5. 1+3*(Layer 4) (Layer 5) 6. 1+3*(Layer 5) (Layer 6) 7. 1+3*(Layer 6) (Layer 7) 8. 1+3*(Layer 7) (Layer 8) 9. 1+3*(Layer 8) (Layer 9) So, yes, there are 9 layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1=4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, then a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer step by step. That's a good cross-verification. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a safer approach to avoid mistakes. Another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, since it's finite (only 9 layers), the step-by-step computation or using the recurrence relation is more straightforward. If it were an infinite series, we might use a different approach, but for a finite nested expression like this, the step-by-step or the recurrence method works best. So, to summarize, by either computing each layer one by one or using the recurrence relation with the general formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the cross-verification using the formula supports the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ", but wait, 29524 is 29000 + 524. So, maybe breaking it down differently: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it together: 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that formula. Actually, for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n}*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). In our case, c=3, d=1. But wait, in our problem, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, yes, c=3, d=1. The general solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, let me make sure. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition: a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1= A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since the expression is nested, it's more efficient to model it as a recurrence relation, which we did. So, using the formula a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9, we get a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed Layer 9, I might have miscalculated 3*9841. Let me check that again: 9841 * 3. Let's compute 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, 3 * 29,524 is indeed 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check my multiplication again just to be sure. 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've done this correctly. Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost, and then moving outward, multiplying each time by 3 and adding 1. Then, the final result was obtained by multiplying the last layer by 3. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's do it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nWait, that gives me 87572. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 88572. I must have messed up the digits. Let me write it correctly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which contradicts. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me check again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carry0\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write7, carry2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8\n\nSo the result is 87572? But when I broke it down, I got 88572. There's inconsistency here. Let me add 29524 three times to verify:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the digit-by-digit multiplication must have had a miscount in the places. Probably, I shifted a digit incorrectly when writing. Let's correct that:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 =12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 =6 +1=7 \u21927, carry0\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry0\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carry2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo the number is 8 (from 2\u00d73 +2) then 7 (from 9\u00d73), then 5 (from 5\u00d73), then7 (from 2\u00d73 +1), then 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that would be 87572, but when adding, it's 88572. So I think I might have miscounted the digits. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard multiplication method:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7        3\n-----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d73 =6 +1=7 \u2192 write7, carry0\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write5, carry1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write8, carry2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write8\n\nSo writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. So I think I messed up the digit positions earlier. So the correct multiplication is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers. I started with Layer1:1+3=4. Then Layer2:1+3*4=13, Layer3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiplied by 3:29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL_2 =1 + 3*L1 =1 +3*4=13\n\nL_3=1 +3*L2=1+3*13=40\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, in general, L_{n} =1 +3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1\n\nWith L_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA =3*A +1\n\nA -3A =1\n\n-2A=1\n\nA= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 =3C -1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2 =3C \u2192 9/2=3C \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer, L_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2713\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2713\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2713\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2713\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2713\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2713\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2713\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2713\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2713\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L9 directly.\n\nGiven that, L9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n2. **Find the closed-form formula**: The general solution for the recurrence is \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. **Compute the innermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, no, 29524 is 2 ten-thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 ones. So, when multiplying by 3, starting from the ones:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 \u2192 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2.

Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. It's a recursive-like process, where each term depends on the previous one. I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression. The general form seems to be a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, in general, layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer 8). So, each layer from 1 to 9 is built up, and the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, using the formula, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify the formula works, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we find a general formula for the nth layer as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula to the outermost layer (n=9), we compute layer 9 as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " 3 * 24 = 72 Wait, maybe it's easier to just compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do that:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading it from top to bottom, it's 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let's go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, the first layer is 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. But when I labeled the layers from 1 to 9, each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a layer. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Each time, it's 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time you go out, you add a layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because there are 9 sets of parentheses after the first 3. Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more sets of parentheses? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)), and inside that, each time another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), and inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1+3). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is inside:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...))\n- This continues until the innermost (1+3)\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because each time you have a 1+3 followed by another (1+3(...)). Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 levels. So, when I computed Layer 1 as 1+3=4, Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me see how many times I applied the 1+3*(...) step. Starting from the innermost, each step is one layer. So, if I have 9 layers, that would mean 9 times 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3* that. Wait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers, making it 9 layers in total. So, yes, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a closed-form formula for each layer, confirming that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me verify that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6.

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, my approach was correct, computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but given the time, maybe computing each layer is the most straightforward approach.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 4\nLayer 2: 13 = 4*3 + 1\nLayer 3: 40 = 13*3 + 1\nLayer 4: 121 = 40*3 + 1\nLayer 5: 364 = 121*3 + 1\nLayer 6: 1093 = 364*3 + 1\nLayer 7: 3280 = 1093*3 + 1\nLayer 8: 9841 = 3280*3 + 1\nLayer 9: 29524 = 9841*3 + 1\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's an interesting pattern. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3n + 1, where n is the previous layer.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nLayer 2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nThis seems to fit the pattern. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, now, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th layer. So, yes, the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, so 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches the earlier result. So that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do it properly:\n\n  29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, 89048 + 29524? Wait, no, I think I messed up the addition. Let me try adding 59048 + 29524 properly:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo the sum is 88572. Okay, that matches the previous result. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by identifying that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). I computed each layer starting from the innermost one, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I double-checked the multiplication by adding 29524 three times, which also gave me 88572. So I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous expression})\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each step until reaching the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe it's better to compute it directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems correct. So, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Let me consider the structure of the expression. It's a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x, starting from x=1, and then applying it 8 more times, and then multiplying the result by 3. So, starting with x\u2080 = 1, then x\u2081 = f(x\u2080), x\u2082 = f(x\u2081), ..., up to x\u2089, and then the result is 3*x\u2089. Let me compute each x_i: x\u2080 = 1\nx\u2081 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\nx\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nx\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nx\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nx\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nx\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nx\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nx\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nx\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, 3*x\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9, but starting from the innermost. Wait, actually, in this problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as x_{k} = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}, with x\u2080=1. Then, after 9 iterations, we have x\u2089, and then the final result is 3*x\u2089. So, in general, for such a sequence, we can model it as x_k = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for x_k. The recurrence is x_k = 3*x_{k-1} + 1, with x\u2080=1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is x_k - 3x_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say x_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition x\u2080=1: 1 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = A - 1/2 => A = 3/2. Thus, x_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with k=0: x\u2080 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f k=1: x\u2081 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f k=2: x\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f k=3: x\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, x\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, x\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*x\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be absolutely sure that the result is correct. I think I've covered all possible ways to approach this problem: computing each layer step by step, recognizing the recurrence relation, solving it using standard methods, and verifying with a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Maybe I can approach it that way to verify.\n\nLet me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer, I ended up with 29524 for Layer 9, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, in the problem statement, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3, so maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer1) is Layer2.\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer2) is Layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 (Layer1)\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer1) (Layer2)\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer2) (Layer3)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...), so there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so if I have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, when I computed Layer9 as 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 (Layer1)\n2. 1+3(Layer1) (Layer2)\n3. 1+3(Layer2) (Layer3)\n4. 1+3(Layer3) (Layer4)\n5. 1+3(Layer4) (Layer5)\n6. 1+3(Layer5) (Layer6)\n7. 1+3(Layer6) (Layer7)\n8. 1+3(Layer7) (Layer8)\n9. 1+3(Layer8) (Layer9)\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the final expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer step by step, I got Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But when I used the closed-form solution, I got a_9 = 29524, which is correct, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have just 1 layer: 3*(1+3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nUsing the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Then, 3*a_1 = 12. Correct.\n\nIf I have 2 layers: 3*(1+3*(1+3)) = 3*(1+3*4) = 3*(1+12)=3*13=39.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =13. Then, 3*a_2=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 3 layers: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))) = 3*(1+3*(1+3*4))=3*(1+3*13)=3*(1+39)=3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40. Then, 3*a_3=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller numbers, so it's likely correct for 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized, in the problem statement, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer9). But in the formula, a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so a_9 is the innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, in my earlier approach, a_1 was the innermost, so a_9 would be the outermost, which is 1 + 3*a_8. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but that might not exactly be the case because each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous, so it's more like a sum of 3^k from k=0 to n, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, using the closed-form solution, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form solution agree. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Maybe I counted the layers incorrectly. Let me recount the layers.

Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count them: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n... Continuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3( parts.

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe breaking it down differently. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 3*3=9. So writing that out: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.

Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me do it more carefully: 29524 *3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 3*3=9, write 9. Wait, but 29524 is 29,524. So 29,524 *3: Let's compute 29,524 *3: 29,524 *3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 +27,000=87,000 +1,500=88,500 +60=88,560 +12=88,572. So, 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be solved using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a_n = C*3^n + D. Then, substituting into the equation: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D +1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D +1. So, -2D =1 => D= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I went through each layer step by step, and then I even derived a general formula to confirm. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a general formula for each layer, which we then apply to find the value of the innermost layer. Finally, multiplying this value by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the General Formula:** Recognizing the pattern, the nth layer can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524*3. Let's do this step by step. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation instead of calculating each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's the case here. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient and confirms the earlier result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next. After computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost layer and propagate it outward.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without manually calculating each layer. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let's see if that applies here. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by that recurrence relation. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and particular solution approach. The recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. First, write the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524=88572, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I double-checked each step, and the closed-form solution aligns with the iterative computation. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer (n=9), we compute \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back through each layer and check the computations again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think about the entire expression as a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Since there are nine layers, it's like a geometric series where each term is 3^n times 1, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum. Let me try to write it out. The innermost term is 3, then each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))...). If I expand all the parentheses, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4)...)). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking that maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression or something. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might save time and reduce errors.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. This resembles a geometric series, but it's finite, not infinite. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 =1 + 3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a finite number of terms, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A =1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3*a_9 is indeed the entire expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*a_9. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I went through each layer step by step, then found a closed-form formula to confirm the result, and both methods gave the same answer.

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 27. Wait, that might not be the correct way. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: Break it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\nNow add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is computed correctly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier, perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is a repeated multiplication. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Alternatively, it might be a recurrence relation. Let me think about the recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\nAnd so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nCompute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nMultiply the outermost 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check for any possible miscalculations. Let me try computing the layers again, but maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the previous is always 1 + 3*..., maybe I can think of it as each step being 3*(something) +1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same result. I think I can be confident that the answer is correct. Maybe to cross-verify, I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. For example, if the expression was just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3=4. Next layer:1 + 3*4=13. Outermost:3*13=39. Alternatively, using the formula: For n=3 layers inside, the outermost expression would be 3*(L_3). L_3=(3^{4}-1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Then 3*40=120. Wait, but when I computed step by step, I got 39. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me see: The expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) has three layers inside. So, according to the formula, L_3=(3^{4}-1)/2=40. Then, 3*40=120. But when I compute step by step: Innermost:1+3=4. Next:1 +3*4=13. Outermost:3*(1 +3*13)=3*(40)=120. Wait, but in my previous step-by-step, I thought I had 39, but that must have been a miscalculation. Let me recompute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Innermost:1 +3=4. Next:1 +3*4=13. Then:1 +3*13=40. Then, outermost:3*40=120. Yes, that's correct. So, 120 is the correct answer for that smaller expression. So, the formula works there. Therefore, I can trust that the formula is correct, and thus the answer for the original problem is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that seems a bit high, but considering the layers, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's growing exponentially. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) if I remember correctly. Let me check. Wait, actually, for the recurrence relation L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the closed-form solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1). Let me verify this with the first few layers. Let's say a = 1, b = 3. Then, for n=1: L_1 = 1. According to the formula: L_1 = 1*(3^{1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Formula: 1*(3^2 -1)/(3 -1) = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Formula: 1*(3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers are there? The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is the innermost part, right? Wait, no, actually, in the expression, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer is built upon that. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, Layer 9 is computed as (3^9 - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, Layer 9 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9 step by step, I got 29524. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no, actually, Layer 9 in my step-by-step was 29524, but according to the formula, it's 9841. That suggests that perhaps I misapplied the formula. Wait, no, because in the step-by-step, Layer 1 was 4, which is (3^1 +1). Wait, no, let me clarify. The formula gives L_n = (3^n -1)/2. So, Layer 1: n=1, L1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But in reality, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps the formula is shifted. Wait, maybe because in the formula, n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which in our case is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. But according to the formula, L1 should be 1. So, perhaps the formula is for n layers starting from 0? Let me think. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for the expression without the outermost 3. Let me think. The formula gives L_n = (3^n -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9, which would be 3*9841=29523. Wait, but in my step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me re-examine that. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. But according to the formula, L9 should be (3^9 -1)/2=9841, and then the expression would be 3*9841=29523. So, which one is correct? There's a contradiction here. Let me see where I might have gone wrong. Wait, perhaps the formula is for the expression without the outermost 3. Let me think. If I consider the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(L9), and L9 is (3^9 -1)/2=9841, then 3*9841=29523. But in my step-by-step, I have Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, which is it? Let me check with n=1. If n=1, the expression is 3*(1 + 3). According to the formula, L1=(3^1 -1)/2=1, then 3*1=3. But in reality, 3*(1 +3)=3*4=12. So, the formula doesn't match. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here because the expression is 3*(L9), whereas the formula gives L9 as (3^9 -1)/2. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(3^9 -1)/2=3*(19683 -1)/2=3*19682/2=3*9841=29523. But according to my step-by-step, I got 88572. So, which is correct? There must be a misunderstanding in how I'm applying the formula. Let me think again. Each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, Layer 1: 1 +3=4 Layer 2:1 +3*4=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524 So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, why does the formula give a different result? Because the formula is for the expression without the outermost 3. So, perhaps the formula is for the innermost Layer 1, which is 4, which is (3^2 +1)/2? Wait, no. Wait, Layer 1 is 4, which is 1 +3=4. So, maybe the formula needs to be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for the entire expression, not just the innermost layers. Wait, let's think differently. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), where there are 9 layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern. Let me compute the first few layers manually and see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 +3) = 3*4=12 E_2 = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(13)=39 E_3 = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(40)=120 E_4=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))=3*(1 +3*40)=3*(121)=363 E_5=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))=3*(1 +3*121)=3*(364)=1092 E_6=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))=3*(1 +3*364)=3*(1093)=3279 E_7=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))=3*(1 +3*1093)=3*(3280)=9840 E_8=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))=3*(1 +3*3280)=3*(9841)=29523 E_9=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))=3*(1 +3*9841)=3*(29524)=88572 So, according to this, E_1=12, E_2=39, E_3=120, E_4=363, E_5=1092, E_6=3279, E_7=9840, E_8=29523, E_9=88572. So, each E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}). Wait, no, actually, each E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), but in reality, E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), where E_0 would be 1? Wait, let me see. If I define E_0=1, then E_1=3*(1 +3*E_0)=3*(1 +3*1)=3*4=12 Correct. E_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*(37)=111 Wait, but earlier, E_2 was 39. So, that doesn't match. So, perhaps my definition is off. Alternatively, perhaps E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=3*(1 +3)=12. Then E_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*(37)=111, which doesn't match my earlier step-by-step where E_2 was 39. So, perhaps I'm misdefining E_n. Alternatively, perhaps E_n is the expression with n layers, so E_1=3*(1 +3)=12, E_2=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39, E_3=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*40=120, etc. So, E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), with E_1=12. So, the recurrence is E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), E_1=12. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general form is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3, b=3. The solution to such a recurrence is E_n = a^{n}*(E_0) + b*(a^{n} -1)/(a -1). Wait, but in our case, E_1=12, so perhaps E_0 would be something else. Let me try to find E_n in terms of E_1. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution E_p. So, E_p = 3*(1 +3*E_p) => E_p = 3 +9*E_p => E_p -9*E_p=3 => -8*E_p=3 => E_p= -3/8. That seems messy, but perhaps we can proceed. The general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} -3/8. Applying the initial condition E_1=12: 12 = C*3^{1} -3/8 => 12 =3C -3/8 => 3C=12 +3/8=96/8 +3/8=99/8 => C=99/(8*3)=33/8. Therefore, E_n= (33/8)*3^{n} -3/8. Let me test this for n=1: E_1= (33/8)*3 -3/8= (99/8 -3/8)=96/8=12 Correct. For n=2: E_2= (33/8)*9 -3/8=297/8 -3/8=294/8=147/4=36.75. But according to our step-by-step, E_2=39. So, that's not matching. Hmm, seems like there's a mistake in the particular solution. Let me try again. The recurrence is E_n = 3*(1 +3*E_{n-1})=3 +9*E_{n-1}. So, E_n -9*E_{n-1}=3. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)}=C*9^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution E_p. Plugging into the equation: E_p -9*E_p=3 => -8*E_p=3 => E_p= -3/8. So, the general solution is E_n= C*9^{n} -3/8. Applying the initial condition E_1=12: 12= C*9 -3/8 => 9C=12 +3/8=96/8 +3/8=99/8 => C=99/(8*9)=11/8. Therefore, E_n= (11/8)*9^{n} -3/8. Let's test for n=1: E_1= (11/8)*9 -3/8=99/8 -3/8=96/8=12 Correct. For n=2: E_2= (11/8)*81 -3/8=891/8 -3/8=888/8=111. But according to our step-by-step, E_2=39. So, this is not matching. Wait, but in our step-by-step, E_2=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39. So, the formula is giving E_2=111, which is not matching. Therefore, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence is not E_n=3 +9*E_{n-1}, but rather E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1})=3 +9*E_{n-1}. So, yes, that's correct. So, the recurrence is E_n=9*E_{n-1} +3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*9^{n}, and the particular solution is E_p= -3/8 as before. Therefore, the general solution is E_n= C*9^{n} -3/8. Applying E_1=12: 12= C*9 -3/8 => 9C=12 +3/8=99/8 => C=11/8. Therefore, E_n= (11/8)*9^{n} -3/8. So, for n=2: E_2= (11/8)*81 -3/8= 891/8 -3/8=888/8=111. But in reality, E_2=39. So, something is wrong here. Wait, perhaps the initial condition is not E_1=12, but E_0= something else. Let me think. If I define E_0=1, then E_1=3*(1 +3*E_0)=3*(1 +3*1)=12. Then E_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*37=111. But according to our manual computation, E_2 should be 39. So, this suggests that the recurrence is not E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), but perhaps E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), but starting from E_0=1. But in that case, E_1=12, E_2=111, which doesn't match our manual computation. So, perhaps the issue is that in our manual computation, E_2 is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39, but according to the recurrence, E_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*37=111. So, the discrepancy is because in the manual computation, E_2 is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3)), which is 3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39, but according to the recurrence, E_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*37=111. So, the difference is that in the manual computation, E_1 is 4, not 12. Wait, that's because in the manual computation, Layer 1 is 4, which is 1 +3. But in the recurrence, E_1 is defined as 3*(1 +3)=12. So, the recurrence is starting from the entire expression, whereas in the manual computation, I'm starting from the innermost layer. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not directly applicable here because the recurrence is starting from the entire expression, whereas in the manual computation, I'm building up from the innermost layer. Therefore, perhaps the formula is correct for the expression E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=12, but in the manual computation, I'm computing the innermost layer first, which is Layer 1=4, then Layer 2=13, etc., up to Layer 9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, in this case, the formula for E_n= (11/8)*9^{n} -3/8 is giving a different result because it's considering the entire expression as E_n, whereas in the manual computation, I'm computing the innermost layer first. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not necessary here, and the manual computation is more straightforward. So, to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the manual computation, which gives the final answer as 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.

Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do it step by step, you might make a mistake.

Yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them: Starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, how many times does 1+3( occur? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each starting with 1+3. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, we can compute L_2, L_3, etc., up to L_9, as I did earlier. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants to be determined. To find C, we can consider the steady-state solution when L_n = L_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Wait, that's a negative number, but our layers are all positive. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Then, 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Finally, the outermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so there are nine layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the innermost part, right? But wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524.\n\nBut the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify with a smaller version to see if my approach is correct. Let's take a smaller version of the problem, say, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that manually.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, expanding the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, another small example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, yes, my approach seems to work. Therefore, going back to the original problem, computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 3( ... )\n\nInside, it's 1 + 3(...), so that's the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n4. 1+3(...)\n5. 1+3(...)\n6. 1+3(...)\n7. 1+3(...)\n8. 1+3(...)\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost 1 + 3, and Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, my calculation up to Layer 9 as 29524 seems correct, and then 3*29524 is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the layers again, perhaps using a different approach or looking for a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved as a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + (c/(r - 1)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me apply that formula here. The general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (1)/(3 - 1) = A*3^n + 1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 1/2 => 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => A = (7/2)/3 = 7/6.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (7/6)*3^1 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/2) + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = (21/2) + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. That's a problem. It seems my formula is giving a wrong result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in solving the recurrence. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different because the recurrence starts at n=1, and the general solution might need adjustment. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each term step by step, as I did before, since there are only nine layers, and that's manageable.\n\nWait, but using the formula, for n=2, a_2 should be 13, but according to the formula I derived, it's 11. That's incorrect. So, perhaps my approach was wrong.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, that works. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression.

So, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute it more efficiently instead of calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{hom} + a_n^{part} = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can express it using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe I should break it down differently. Alternatively, 3 * 29524: 3 * 29000 = 87000 3 * 524 = 1572 So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572 Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which seems quite large. Let me check my calculations again, because maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but that seems quite large. Let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3 parts. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, moving out, each time we have 1+3*(previous layer). So, the total number of layers is 9, as I thought before. So, the computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me substitute into the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\nSimplify the right side:\n= 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, subtract 3B from both sides:\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers: Starting from the innermost, each layer is one more than the previous. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, n=9, which gives L(9)=29524. Therefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(L(9)), where L(9)=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and recognize it as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers.\n\nBut I think the method I used earlier is solid, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Calculating up to n=9 layers and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Define the recurrence relation**: Let L(n) represent the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\n3. **Find the closed-form solution**: Solving the recurrence relation gives L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute L(9)**: Substitute n=9 into the formula: L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's a linear recursion where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this sequence is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Since the original expression has 9 layers, that would correspond to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same result.

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's expand the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is indeed following the pattern. The recurrence relation can be solved as follows: The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, maybe I can compute it using the closed-form formula directly. Let's see, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, that confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4.

    "text": " 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So Layer 2: 1 + 12 =13, Layer3:1 +39=40, Layer4:1+120=121, Layer5:1+363=364, Layer6:1+1092=1093, Layer7:1+3279=3280, Layer8:1+9840=9841, Layer9:1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches Layer1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is Layer2. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is Layer3. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result.

Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, so that checks out. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same number. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).
