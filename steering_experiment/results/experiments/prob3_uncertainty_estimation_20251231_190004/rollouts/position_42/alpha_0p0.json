    "text": " 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (Correct) So, I think I did it right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... Up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, is there a formula for a_n in terms of n? Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, I could have computed a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the expression were much longer. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, I'll recompute 3^{10} to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the key steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result. 3. Alternatively, derive a formula using the recurrence relation to compute the nth term directly. 4. Use the formula to compute the 9th term, then multiply by 3. 5. Verify all calculations to ensure accuracy. This problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also reinforced the importance of checking work through multiple methods to avoid errors.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or a formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3, the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. So that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each time we go out, we add another 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1) Then next layer: 1+3*4=13 (Layer 2) Then next:1+3*13=40 (Layer3) Then 1+3*40=121 (Layer4) Then 1+3*121=364 (Layer5) Then 1+3*364=1093 (Layer6) Then 1+3*1093=3280 (Layer7) Then 1+3*3280=9841 (Layer8) Then 1+3*9841=29524 (Layer9) Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing exponentially, and 88,572 seems large, but considering each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). This is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9, since there are nine layers. Let me compute a_1 through a_9 using this recurrence relation to see if I get the same numbers as before. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly the same as before. So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think the solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 times (1 plus another similar expression). By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). The innermost term is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around the previous result.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. **Apply the Final Multiplication:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification with Closed-Form Formula:**\n   Using the derived formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), for \\( n = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n   Thus, the final result is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,752. But that's conflicting with the earlier breakdown. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way. 29,524 * 3 can be computed as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the correct result is 88,572, which means I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29,524 as:\n\nDigit positions: Ten-thousands (2), thousands (9), hundreds (5), tens (2), units (4).\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\nUnits: 4*3=12. Units digit: 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens: 2*3=6 +1=7. Tens digit:7, carryover 0.\n\nHundreds:5*3=15. Hundreds digit:5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands:9*3=27 +1=28. Thousands digit:8, carryover 2.\n\nTen-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8. Ten-thousands digit:8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,752. But that's not matching the correct result of 88,572. There's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I swapped the hundreds and thousands digits. Let me check:\n\nAfter multiplying:\n\n- Units: 2\n\n- Tens: 7\n\n- Hundreds: 5\n\n- Thousands: 8\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,752. But that's incorrect because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. So, where is the mistake? Wait, perhaps I miscounted the carryover in the thousands place. Let me go through it again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Units:2, carryover1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7. Tens:7, carryover0.\n\n5*3=15. Hundreds:5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28. Thousands:8, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8. Ten-thousands:8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But that's conflicting with the correct result. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown method earlier. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 using another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nNow, multiply each by 3:\n\n20,000 *3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 *3 = 27,000\n\n500 *3 = 1,500\n\n20 *3 = 60\n\n4 *3 =12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 +12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the correct result is 88,572, which means that in the digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have made a mistake. Let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Units:2, carryover1.\n\n2 *3=6+1=7. Tens:7, carryover0.\n\n5 *3=15. Hundreds:5, carryover1.\n\n9 *3=27+1=28. Thousands:8, carryover2.\n\n2 *3=6+2=8. Ten-thousands:8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,752. But that's wrong. Wait, maybe I wrote the digits in the wrong order. Let me write it step by step:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But that's not matching the correct result. I'm confused. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the carryover. Let me check the thousands place again: 9*3=27 +1=28. So, thousands digit is 8, carryover2. Then, ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. So, the digits are:\n\nTen-thousands:8\n\nThousands:8\n\nHundreds:7\n\nTens:5\n\nUnits:2\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I mixed up the hundreds and thousands digits. Let me think again. The digits are:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1. Units:2\n\n2. Tens:7\n\n3. Hundreds:5\n\n4. Thousands:8\n\n5. Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But that can't be right because 29,524 *3 is 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try a different approach: write it out vertically.\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *       3\n\n    -----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12. Write 2, carryover1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7. Write7, carryover0.\n\n5 *3=15. Write5, carryover1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28. Write8, carryover2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8. Write8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88,752. But this contradicts the correct result of 88,572. There must be a miscalculation here. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out with proper alignment:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *       3\n\n    -----------\n\n          12 (4*3)\n\n          7  (2*3 +1)\n\n        15   (5*3)\n\n      28    (9*3 +1)\n\n    6      (2*3 +2)\n\n    ----------------\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nUnits:2\n\nTens:7\n\nHundreds:5\n\nThousands:8\n\nTen-thousands:8\n\nBut wait, the hundreds place is 5, which comes from 5*3=15, so we write 5 and carryover1. Then, thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, so we write8 and carryover2. Then, ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,752. But that's not correct. Wait, I think I see the mistake. When adding up the partial products, I should align them properly. Let me write it again with proper alignment:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *       3\n\n    -----------\n\n          12 (4*3)\n\n          7  (2*3 +1)\n\n        15   (5*3)\n\n      28    (9*3 +1)\n\n    6      (2*3 +2)\n\n    ----------------\n\nNow, adding them:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nUnits:2\n\nTens:7\n\nHundreds:5\n\nThousands:8\n\nTen-thousands:8\n\nBut wait, that's 88,752. However, the correct result is 88,572. So, there's a discrepancy. I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me check again:\n\nWhen multiplying 29,524 by 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carryover1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write7, carryover0.\n\n- 5*3=15, write5, carryover1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But that's incorrect. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the places. Let me count the digits:\n\n29,524 is a 5-digit number. When multiplied by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Since 29,524 is less than 30,000, 30,000*3=90,000, so the result should be less than 90,000, which is a 5-digit number. So, 88,572 is correct, but according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I'm getting 88,752. That's a problem. Let me check with another method. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 using another approach: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? Let me check again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Units:2, carryover1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Tens:7, carryover0.\n\n5*3=15. Hundreds:5, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Thousands:8, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Ten-thousands:8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But that's wrong. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the thousands place. Let me see: 9 is in the thousands place, so 9*3=27, plus the carryover1 makes 28. So, we write down 8 and carryover2 to the ten-thousands place. Then, 2 (ten-thousands place) *3=6, plus carryover2=8. So, the ten-thousands digit is8, thousands digit is8, hundreds digit is5, tens digit is7, units digit is2. So, the number is 88,752. But that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the places. Let me write it out with commas:\n\nThe result should be 88,572, which is 88,572.\n\nBut according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I'm getting 88,752. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Wait, perhaps I swapped the hundreds and thousands digits. Let me check:\n\nAfter multiplying:\n\n- Units:2\n\n- Tens:7\n\n- Hundreds:5\n\n- Thousands:8\n\n- Ten-thousands:8\n\nSo, the number is 88,752. But that's incorrect. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check:\n\n5 is in the hundreds place, so 5*3=15. So, we write 5 in the hundreds place and carryover1 to the thousands place. Then, thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28. So, write8 in the thousands place and carryover2 to the ten-thousands place. Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. So, the digits are:\n\nTen-thousands:8\n\nThousands:8\n\nHundreds:7\n\nTens:5\n\nUnits:2\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, the hundreds place is 5, which comes from 5*3=15, so we write5 in the hundreds place. Then, thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, so we write8 in the thousands place. Then, ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. So, the digits are:\n\nTen-thousands:8\n\nThousands:8\n\nHundreds:5\n\nTens:7\n\nUnits:2\n\nSo, the number is 88,572. Wait, that's correct! I must have made a mistake earlier when writing it out. So, the correct result is 88,572. Phew! Okay, so after carefully going through each step, I realize that the correct final answer is 88,572. I must have miscounted the digits earlier when I thought it was 88,752, but upon rechecking, it's indeed 88,572. So, to summarize:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct now. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using another method or check with a calculator, but since I don't have a calculator here, I'll rely on my step-by-step computation. Each layer seems to compute correctly, and the final multiplication gives me 88,572. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the nesting, it might be correct. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1:1+3, then Layer 2:1+3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer 9. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. Alternatively, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4 can be solved as follows: The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, but since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's try a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's value by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscount when dealing with multiple layers. Let me verify each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, right? 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; 9000+840=9840; 9840+1=9841. Correct.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct.) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572.

That seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can help avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are many layers. Looking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation. The recurrence is: a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 1. The homogeneous part is a_{n+1} - 3a_n =0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 =0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p -3a_p =1 \u2192 -2a_p=1 \u2192 a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A =4 +1/2= 9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think this confirms that the answer is correct. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure that there are no calculation errors, especially with so many layers involved. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recursive formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is indeed the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we determine that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3 might be better computed as 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As I calculated earlier, that's 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that applies here. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, the sequence goes like 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the final result is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a geometric series or something here. Let me see: If I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, say a1, a2, a3,..., a9, where a1=4, and each subsequent term is a_{n}=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, etc., up to a9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from the equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition: a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a9= (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=59049/2 - 1/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a9= (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524 Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, that seems quite large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each layer adds another (1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers: 1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n...\nEach time, it's a new layer. Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3 around it. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 inside each parenthesis.\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n- Then the next is 1+3(1+3).\n- Then 1+3(1+3(1+3)).\n- Each time, it's another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the first inner parenthesis is (1+3(...)), then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, that would be 9 layers. Wait, no. Let me see: the entire expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), which itself contains another (1+3(...)), and so on. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3 nested. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. The expression ends with 9 closing parentheses after the first 3. So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to 29524 for Layer 9, and then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me check if I'm miscounting the layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about it differently. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4 (since 1+3=4). Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. From the recurrence, L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer is given by L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let's compute 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, I think my final answer is 88572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors. Let's recompute Layers 7, 8, 9 again. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can recognize here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers in the future. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 4. Then layer 2 is a_2 = 13, and so on, up to layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute the value without having to manually compute each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if there are more layers. But since I had only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula for future reference. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression to see if that's the case. Starting from the innermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Each time, you have a term that's 1 + 3 times another similar term. If I expand all the parentheses, the expression becomes a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Let's take a smaller version first: Suppose we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Now, expanding this expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. Now, let's see if this can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3^1 + 1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, let me think again. Let's try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me consider the general case where there are n layers. Each layer adds a term of 3^{k} where k increases by 1 each time. For example, with n=1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. But 4 is 3^1 + 1, so 3*(3^1 + 1) = 3^2 + 3^1. Wait, that's 9 + 3 = 12. Correct. For n=2: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. But 13 is 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. So, 3*(3^2 + 3^1 + 1) = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1. Which is 27 + 9 + 3 = 39. Correct. Similarly, for n=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. And 40 is 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. So, 3*(3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1) = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1. Which is 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 120. Correct. So, in general, for n layers, the expression is equal to the sum from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k. Wait, let me check: For n=1, the sum is 3^1 + 3^2 = 3 + 9 = 12, which matches. For n=2, the sum is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 3 + 9 + 27 = 39, which matches. For n=3, the sum is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120, which matches. Therefore, for our problem, which has 9 layers, the expression would be equal to the sum from k=1 to k=10 of 3^k, because n=9, so n+1=10. The sum of a geometric series is given by S = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Here, a=3, r=3, and n=10. So, S = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to arrive at the same answer, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. That's pretty neat because it avoids having to compute each layer step by step. I think this is a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers increases. But since I already computed each layer manually and got the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, here's the process: 1. Recognize the nested structure and that each layer can be computed step by step starting from the innermost. 2. Compute each layer from the inside out, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 3. After computing the innermost layers, work outward until reaching the outermost layer. 4. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer. Alternatively, 1. Recognize the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. 2. Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to compute the total. 3. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. Both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - Final Answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Yes, that's consistent. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helps prevent mistakes. I guess another way to approach this would be to recognize a pattern or formula, but since each layer is dependent on the previous one, it's probably necessary to compute each layer individually. Alternatively, if I think about this as a geometric series or something, but I don't see an immediate way to apply a formula here because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me see, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each term. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That might be faster, especially if the number of layers is large, but for just nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. But it's good to know that the formula works. So, either way, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such nested expressions. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, my step-by-step approach seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. We can also find another equation by considering the recurrence relation. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, from the initial condition: 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute it using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. I think I've solved it correctly. Just to recap, I computed each layer step by step, then found a general formula to confirm the result, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct result for this expression.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recompute each layer carefully. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. So, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's compute 29524 *3 step by step: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me check each layer again. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, each layer is computed correctly. Then, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the depth of the nesting, it's plausible. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something. Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a linear recurrence. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). Since there are nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 +3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each 1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each layer adds another. Let me count the number of times I see (1+3(...). I think it's nine times. Let me check: Starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one, and each subsequent layer adds another. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we wrap it with another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each (1+3(...) starts a new layer. So, how many (1+3(...) are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, yes, nine layers in total. Therefore, a_9 is the outermost layer, which we computed as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step to make sure each layer is correct. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Wait, but when I did it the first time, I broke it down into parts and got the same result. So, 88572 seems correct. Hmm, but I have a feeling that the answer might be different. Let me try another approach. Maybe instead of computing each layer step by step, I can find a pattern or formula. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's see what happens for a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plugging A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524. As before, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears. Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1+3(...). Let me count them: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There's one after the first 3, then each subsequent one. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the first 3: (1 + 3( ... )) So, each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, so 9 layers. So, n=9, as I thought earlier. So, the formula gives a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, all layers are correct. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572 is the final answer. But wait, let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, when I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, that was 1 + 3, and Layer 9 was the outermost. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n10. 3(...))))) Hmm, wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. From the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"1+3(\", that's Layer 1, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. 1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n10. 1+3))))) Wait, that's 9 instances of \"1+3(\", so that would mean 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think my initial counting was correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and the final answer being 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, all layers check out. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because 88572 seems like a large number, but given the number of layers, it might be correct. Let me try a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. For example, let's take a simpler version with just one layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*(4) = 12. If I compute it step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*4=12. Correct. Now, two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Using my method: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, then 3*13=39. Correct. Three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40=120. My method: Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, then 3*40=120. Correct. So, my approach works for smaller numbers, so it's likely correct for the larger problem as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3 is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So 3 * 29524. Let me compute this again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me write the expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's compute from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've got it right. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped a lot. I just need to make sure I didn't skip any layers or make any arithmetic mistakes along the way.

Okay, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, expressions like this can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then each Lk = 1 + 3*Lk+1, starting from L9 = 1 + 3*L10, but since L10 doesn't exist, maybe L9 is the innermost one. Wait, no, in our case, L1 is the innermost, so L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, maybe there's a pattern or formula for Lk in terms of k. Let me see if I can find a recurrence relation. Let's define Lk as 1 + 3*Lk+1, with L9 being the innermost, so L9 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, no, in our earlier calculation, L1 was the innermost. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me consider that each layer is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 being the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc., as before. So, the recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4. Then, the expression is 3*L9. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1. The homogeneous solution is Lk^h = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume Lk^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^(k+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with k=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. k=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. k=3: L3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Lk = (3^(k+1) -1)/2. Since we have L9, that would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a much faster method, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

    "text": " 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the result should be 88572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 =13. L_3 =1 + 3*L_2 =1 + 39=40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence would be L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2=13. So, 13 = A*3^2 + B =9A + B. Now, subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A= 9/6= 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 4= 3*(3/2) + B => 4= 9/2 + B => B=4 - 9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. Therefore, the general formula would be L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1= (3^2)/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer, which confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
