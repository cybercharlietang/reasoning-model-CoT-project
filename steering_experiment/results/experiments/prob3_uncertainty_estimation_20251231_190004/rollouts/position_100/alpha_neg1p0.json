Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. Good. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations.

Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set equal to left side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see if this is a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. If I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote each step as follows: Let me define E(n) as the expression with n layers. So, E(1) = 1 + 3 =4. E(2)=1 +3*E(1)=1 +3*4=13. E(3)=1 +3*E(2)=1 +3*13=40. E(4)=1 +3*E(3)=1 +3*40=121. E(5)=1 +3*E(4)=1 +3*121=364. E(6)=1 +3*E(5)=1 +3*364=1093. E(7)=1 +3*E(6)=1 +3*1093=3280. E(8)=1 +3*E(7)=1 +3*3280=9841. E(9)=1 +3*E(8)=1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: When I expand E(n), each layer adds another term. Let me try expanding E(1)=4=1+3=1+3^1. E(2)=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=1 +3 +3^2=13. E(3)=1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3=40. Wait a minute, that seems to be the case. So, E(n) = 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^n. Because each time, we're adding another power of 3. Let me check: E(1)=1 +3=1 +3^1=4. E(2)=1 +3 +9=1 +3 +3^2=13. E(3)=1 +3 +9 +27=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3=40. Yes, so E(n)=1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^n. That's a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and n+1 terms. The sum of such a series is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, E(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with all methods. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough times using different approaches: computing each layer step by step, using recurrence relations, and recognizing the geometric series pattern. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner layer by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues until the outermost layer is reached. Recognizing this as a geometric series allows for a more efficient computation using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The final result is obtained by multiplying the sum by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the value inside the outermost 3*() is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can also compute this using the closed-form expression. Since the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step or using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final result of 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same answer, and I double-checked each step. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So, that's another way to get the same result, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That might be faster if the number of layers were larger, but in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so the entire expression is a geometric series.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Calculating each layer step by step leads to the final result. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute the innermost expression efficiently, confirming the result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, then used the recurrence relation approach to find a closed-form solution, which also gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we derive a closed-form solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times.

So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.
