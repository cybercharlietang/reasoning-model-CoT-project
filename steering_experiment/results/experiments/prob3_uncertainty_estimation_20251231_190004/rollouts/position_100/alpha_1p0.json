Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have computed it more quickly, but since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, the key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula for the nth term. In this case, since it's a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, the closed-form was manageable. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, computing each layer step by step also works, as I did before. It just takes more time, but it's straightforward.

Comparing both sides, we have B = 1 + 3B, which implies that -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.

Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, left side: C*3^n + D, right side: C*3^n + 3D + 1. Therefore, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1. Then, -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Then, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula holds. For example, if n=1, then the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. According to the formula, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, then 3*a_1 = 12. Correct. Similarly, for n=2: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. According to the formula, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, then 3*a_2 = 39. Correct. Similarly, for n=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, wait. Wait, n=3 would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute it step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. According to the formula, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*a_3 = 120. Correct. So the formula works.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional term, which is a bit unexpected given the initial terms are integers. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. Another way to think about this is that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, done 9 times, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3 again. So, in terms of functions, it's like f(x) = 3x + 1, applied 9 times starting from 1, and then multiplied by 3. But I think the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, let's equate the coefficients: For 3^n: A*3^n = A*3^n, which is okay. For constants: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.

So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, so the solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Alternatively, if I didn't realize the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, especially since there are only nine layers. But knowing the recurrence helps to see the pattern and confirm the result. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula. For example, layer 4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, as I computed before. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, using the formula is a quicker way, but since the problem is presented as a nested expression, computing step by step is also straightforward. I think I've covered all the steps and verified the answer using two methods: direct computation and finding a closed-form formula.

Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Substituting into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, the equation becomes: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost term is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.
