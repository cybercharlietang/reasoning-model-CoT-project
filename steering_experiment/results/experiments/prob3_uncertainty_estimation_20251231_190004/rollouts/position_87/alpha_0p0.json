    "text": " Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's list the values again: a1 = 4 a2 = 13 a3 = 40 a4 = 121 a5 = 364 a6 = 1093 a7 = 3280 a8 = 9841 a9 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, but that's the same as the recursion we have. So, to solve this recursion, maybe I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches a4=121. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which confirms our earlier result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might make it easier to compute, especially for larger n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer. The expression is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me consider the general form. If I have a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...))). Each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. If I expand this, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this out step by step, but maybe it's more complicated. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, so for 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recompute 3*29524: 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +60=88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524. Let's add them: 29524 +29524: 29524*2=59048. Then, 59048 +29524: 59048 +20000=79048, 79048 +9000=88048, 88048 +500=88548, 88548 +24=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. The initial condition is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, for n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same as Layer 9 which we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches our previous result. So, using the recurrence relation and the general formula, we arrive at the same answer. This method is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors, especially with so many layers.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to express this without computing each layer, I could have used the formula directly. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equate coefficients: A*3^n terms cancel out. Then, B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Substitute the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to write it using the formula, the total expression would be 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, is there a way to express this without computing each layer? Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or some other pattern. Let me see. Let's consider that each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. It seems straightforward with the recurrence approach. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost 1 + 3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. Let me write down the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it directly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{n} and see if there's a pattern, but since I've already computed it using both iterative and formula methods, and both give the same result, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the next layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Wait, but in my earlier computation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, a_3 was 40, and so on. So, perhaps this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the answer is the same. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. Applying this formula for the 9th layer gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, but since there are only nine terms, computing them manually might be faster. Alternatively, we can observe that this is a geometric progression. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine terms, computing each step is manageable, which I did. Alternatively, the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^n + 2)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1)) ). Wait, maybe I need to adjust that formula. Alternatively, for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which is exactly what I got when computing step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572, same as before. So that's consistent. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. So, I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let me see. Each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it directly without going through each layer. That might have been a smarter approach, but since the problem has only nine layers, computing each step was manageable. But for larger numbers, the formula would be more efficient. Anyway, I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps this can be expressed as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. It's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation of the first order. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution or see a pattern. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. So, a9 is 29524, and then 3*a9 is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with a1: a1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a9, n=9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to, I could express the entire computation using exponents. Since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, after n layers, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, with 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, recognize the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us the value of the innermost expression, which is then used to compute the entire expression. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if each layer is correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct.

Therefore, the solution is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. It seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_k as the value at the k-th layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe the general formula for a_k is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = C*3^k, and a particular solution can be found. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when k=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For k=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, we can compute the result without manually computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost, each layer is a (1+3(...)). So from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - outermost\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). Let me count the number of layers. Each (1+3) is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So the total number of layers is 9, right? Because each time you go one layer out, you add another (1+3(...)). So, 9 layers in total, leading to Layer 9 being the outermost, which is then multiplied by the initial 3. So, my computation of 9 layers seems correct. Therefore, I think my answer is correct: 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or check for a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help me compute it without calculating each term manually. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, labeling them from 1 to 9. 3. After computing the innermost layers, proceed outward until reaching the outermost layer. 4. Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression. 5. As a check, model the nested expressions as a recurrence relation, solve it, and confirm that the result matches the step-by-step computation. This dual approach helps ensure that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous layer})\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so the final result is 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, which would have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a safer approach to avoid mistakes. Either way, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is based on the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds a term. So, the innermost is 4 = 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. Wait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, yes. Then, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Let me check: 1 + 3 = 4, +9 = 13, +27 = 40. Yes, that's correct. So, each layer n adds the next power of 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. So, indeed, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each time, we have a term that's 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me try to expand it. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Now, let's see how many times 3 is multiplied. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by the next term, except the innermost term, which is 1 + 3. Wait, but maybe it's better to see how many layers there are. From the original problem, it's 3*(...), and inside, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the expression inside is a geometric series with 9 terms. Wait, but in the expansion, each layer adds a power of 3. So, when I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to expand it step by step.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost part first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, finally, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the approach, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, I see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). Wait, but I need to check if a \u2260 1, which it isn't here because a = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, assuming a constant solution L_p, would be L_p = (L_p) = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in computing 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach, like expanding the expression. Let me try that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as A=1+3=4. Then, moving outward: B=1+3*A=1+12=13 C=1+3*B=1+39=40 D=1+3*C=1+120=121 E=1+3*D=1+363=364 F=1+3*E=1+1092=1093 G=1+3*F=1+3279=3280 H=1+3*G=1+9840=9841 I=1+3*H=1+29523=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*I=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I did before. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when expanded, each layer adds a term that is 3^n, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 +1) =1 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 1 + 9 + 3 =13. Wait, that's 3^2 + 3^1 +1. Layer 3: 1 +3*(Layer 2)=1 +3*(3^2 +3^1 +1)=1 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1=1 +27 +9 +3=40. So, each layer adds another term of 3^n. So, Layer n would be sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but for Layer 1: sum_{k=0}^{1}3^k=1+3=4. Layer 2: sum_{k=0}^{2}3^k=1+3+9=13. Layer 3: sum_{k=0}^{3}3^k=1+3+9+27=40. So, yes, each Layer n is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^n. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n}3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches the formula I derived earlier. So, Layer 9 is sum_{k=0}^{9}3^k= (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it enough ways, and each time I get the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a nonhomogeneous one. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently, both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula for the layers. It's always good to cross-check using different methods to make sure the answer is correct.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, and each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression can be represented as a sum: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, no, that might not be exactly correct because each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me think. Alternatively, the expression can be represented as 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ). Wait, from the earlier general solution, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it directly, which confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula that could represent this expression without computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation approach, we determine the value of each layer and ultimately compute the entire expression. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, if we consider a_0 = 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so a_0 = (a_1 -1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 1). So, a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) A + B = 1 Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 2: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, applying the formula: a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let's compute that: First, 1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Then, 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, a_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). Simplifying, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Alternatively, we can factor out 1/2: a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9*3^2 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (9*81 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Wait, wait, no: Wait, 3^3 is 27, so 9*27=243, so a_4 = (9*3^3 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9*3^8 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^8 is 6561. So, 9*6561 = 59049. Then, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute a_9 and then multiply by 3, I could perhaps find a more general formula, but since the problem only goes up to Layer 9, computing each step manually or using the recurrence seems manageable. Another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which is similar to building a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and a constant term of 1. The formula we derived earlier is indeed the closed-form solution for such a recurrence. So, using that, we can compute any layer without having to compute all the previous ones, which is efficient. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. I think I've verified it sufficiently. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach it or if I can spot any possible mistakes. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it in a different way, like expanding the entire expression. Let me try that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s and 1s. Each layer adds a 1 and a 3. Since there are 9 layers, each with a 1 and a 3, but the outermost 3 is multiplied at the end. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds a 1 and a 3, but the multiplications are nested. Maybe expanding it would be too cumbersome, but perhaps I can see a pattern. Alternatively, since I have a general formula for a_n, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result, which confirms my earlier computation.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 for the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed before, L_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), but I might need to adjust the indices here. Wait, in our case, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Good, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L_9). Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for nine layers, either method works. I think I've confirmed the answer sufficiently. So, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's assume that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n might dominate, but since we have a finite number of layers, perhaps it's better to find the particular solution. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence step by step. Let's compute a few terms to see if a pattern emerges. L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2? Wait, let me check: From L_1=4 to L_2=13: 3*4=12 +1=13. From L_2=13 to L_3=40: 3*13=39 +1=40. Similarly, 3*40=120 +1=121. So yes, each term is 3*previous +1. So, the general formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divide by 2:177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. That's pretty neat. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, which took time, I could have used the formula to find the result directly. But since I already computed it step by step, it's good to verify using both methods. I think that solidifies the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we can efficiently compute the result. Each layer follows the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\), leading to a closed-form solution.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let x be the entire inner expression, then x = 1 + 3x, but that's not exactly the case here because the nesting is finite. Wait, no, because it's finite, so each layer is dependent on the next. But perhaps using the formula we derived earlier is better. Since we have a finite number of layers, 9 layers, the formula gives us a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

But maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for each layer, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - k*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = A*k^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Then, P = k*P + c => P - kP = c => P(1 - k) = c => P = c/(1 - k). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*k^n + c/(1 - k). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*k^1 + c/(1 - k). Let me plug in k=3 and c=1, since in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3 and c=1. So, 4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) => 4 = 3A + 1/(-2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute the answer without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since I only had nine layers, both methods worked. I think I did it correctly. To double-check, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's define Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can recognize it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 4. Using the recurrence relation, I found a formula that gives me each layer directly. Applied that formula to find L9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did initially, which also led me to the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which reminds me of a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let me consider that each layer is defined recursively by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, which in this case is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = (L(1) - c) * a^(n-1) + c, where c is the constant term when the recurrence reaches equilibrium. Wait, let me recall the formula for such a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution C. So, substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Wait, because n=1 corresponds to L1, so n=9 would be L9. So, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3^n multiplied by some factor, but since I already have the formula, it's more efficient. So, I think I've got the correct answer here. To recap: I broke down the expression into layers, computed each layer step by step, verified the pattern using a recurrence relation, found a general formula, applied it to find the value of the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. I also double-checked my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. It's always good to verify, especially when dealing with multiple layers of computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this more efficiently without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That makes me confident that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's it. So, the problem was about computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern, which can be efficiently solved by recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, thereby avoiding the need to compute each layer manually, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also works, especially if the number of layers isn't too large. In this case, since there were nine layers, it was manageable, but for more layers, a formula would be more efficient. So, in summary, the key steps were: 1. Identify the nested pattern and recognize it as a recurrence relation. 2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. 4. Apply the formula to find the value of the innermost expression and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3. 5. Verify the result using both methods to ensure accuracy. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations to simplify the computation process.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a formula or a recursive relation. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's nine layers, and then the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier calculation. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result.

Continue outward:\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
