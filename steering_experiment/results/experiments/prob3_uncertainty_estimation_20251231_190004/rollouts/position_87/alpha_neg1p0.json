    "text": " Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time, so perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series. Let me think about that approach. Each time, you have a term that's 1 + 3*(previous term). So if I expand it, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let's try expanding the innermost layer first. Let me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term which is 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each time. Let me verify: E1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\nSo, each layer En adds a term 3^n, where n is the layer number. Therefore, E9, the 9th layer, would be 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. That's a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and 9 terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} -1)/(r -1). So, sum = (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is the same as a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. This might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. However, since there are only nine layers, either method works fine. I think I've confirmed it sufficiently. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer forms a geometric series. The sum of this series for nine layers is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think I did that correctly. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time wrapping another 1+3*(previous layer). So, yes, 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did initially, and arrived at the same result. Either way, the answer seems to be 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. It's much faster and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation.

So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, each layer is a geometric series? Let me see. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4. Wait, but actually, L1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 here. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). Wait, but in our case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the denominator 1 - a would be negative. Let me check the standard formula for a linear recurrence of the form x_n = a x_{n-1} + b. The solution is x_n = a^n x_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, in our case, x_0 would be L1 = 4, but actually, our first term is L1 = 4, so perhaps the initial term is L1. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. So, using the formula for such a recurrence, the solution is L_n = (L1 - c) * a^{n} + c, where c = b/(1 - a). Wait, maybe I should derive it. Let's solve the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9=29524, then 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3 is 88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I did it correctly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get the answer. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This forms a geometric series which can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula to the ninth layer gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, which we can compute using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did before. So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. So, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then multiply by 3: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, is there a way to represent this as a geometric series or something similar? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I think recursively, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4, L3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4), and so on. This seems similar to a recurrence relation where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the layers without computing each one. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from L1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then, 3*L9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me write it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost expression as E, where E = 1 + 3. Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 1 + 3*E. But perhaps expanding the entire expression would be tedious, but let's see. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum of terms with powers of 3. Let me try to see the pattern. Let me note that each time we add a layer, it's equivalent to multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 E3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=40 E4=1 +3*E3=1 +3*40=121 E5=1 +3*E4=1 +3*121=364 E6=1 +3*E5=1 +3*364=1093 E7=1 +3*E6=1 +3*1093=3280 E8=1 +3*E7=1 +3*3280=9841 E9=1 +3*E8=1 +3*9841=29524 Then, the total expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and there are nine layers, perhaps the formula I derived earlier applies. Wait, the formula was for L_n, which is the nth layer, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then total expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, that's a more efficient way. So, the expression can be simplified using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, which gives us the result directly. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*(3)^n. The particular solution is a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let\u2019s assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula. For n=1 to n=9, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=4. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=121. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=364. n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=1093. n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=3280. n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=9841. n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when you expand it all the way, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But since it's finite, with 9 layers, the formula we derived earlier is more straightforward. Alternatively, if it were an infinite series, it would converge to a certain value, but in this case, it's finite, so we don't have to worry about convergence. Just computing each layer step by step or using the formula gives the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. That seems like each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for such recurrence relations, the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's substitute the trial solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is layer 1, we have a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Using the formula, the total expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it using the formula.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. So, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. We can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, matches Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the value of the outermost expression before multiplying by 3 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think this is correct. Just to make sure, let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula holds. Let's take n=1: The expression would be 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, n=1 in the formula corresponds to Layer 1, which is 1+3=4, and then the entire expression would be 3*4=12. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_1 = 3*4=12. Correct. For n=2: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)). Compute innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 3*4=12. Then, 1+12=13. Then, 3*13=39. Using the formula: 3*a_2=3*13=39. Correct. For n=3: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))). Innermost:1+3=4. Then, 3*4=12. Then, 1+12=13. Then, 3*13=39. Then, 1+39=40. Then, 3*40=120. Using the formula: 3*a_3=3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller n, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9 as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here that I can express with a formula instead of computing each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using a_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, and there are nine layers, so the sum would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but wait, no, because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, so it's a bit different. Let me see: If I have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then expanding it, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 1 + 3^1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, it seems that a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but that's the sum of a geometric series. The sum of 3^k from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what I derived earlier. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. So, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, let me compute a few layers manually again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, and the entire expression is 3*a9. So, in general, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence approach also led me to the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these kinds of expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers. Let's list the layers again: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 4 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 13 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 40 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 = 121 Layer 5: 364 = 3*121 + 1 = 364 Layer 6: 1093 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093 Layer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280 Layer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841 Layer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524 So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 4, L2 = 3*L1 + 1, L3 = 3*L2 + 1, etc. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That seems like a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for this. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. Wait, in this case, a=3 and b=1. Let me see if that works. Let me denote L_n as the nth term, starting from n=1: L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3=40, etc. So, using the formula: L_n = 3^{n} * L0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, L1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, perhaps L0 is not defined here. Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the formula. Let me think. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K. Now, applying initial condition. Let's say n=1: L1 = C*3^1 + K = 3C + K = 4. We know that K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 3C + (-1/2) = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2) = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be considered as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by deriving a general formula for the layers, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify RHS: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, setting equal to LHS: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Plugging n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We need another equation, but since it's a first-order recurrence, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me assume the particular solution is B, so substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: L_1 = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the initial layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach, but this seems solid. Just to make sure, let me compute a few layers again using the formula to see if it holds. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which is correct. a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that a_9=29524, and the total expression is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 => A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. Let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3: Let me compute that again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way because 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 +5*100 +2*10 +4*1. So, 2*10000=20000, 9*1000=9000, 5*100=500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4. So, 20000 +9000=29000, +500=29500, +20=29520, +4=29524. Then, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substitute L_n = A*3^n + B into the equation: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Rearranging: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is as above. So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step, which could be useful if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives us the final result of 88572. Alternatively, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we can compute the result more directly by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the sequence. Both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression.

So, yes, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, let me clarify: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))). So the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So the number of layers is 9, meaning that the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but offset by 1 each time. But the closed-form approach seems more straightforward here. So, to recap: The expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term in the sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Maybe it's a form of a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set up the equation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this, we can find the fixed point. Let a_n = a_{n-1} = k. Then, k = 1 + 3k => k - 3k = 1 => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. So, the fixed point is -1/2. The general solution for a linear recurrence of this form is a_n = A*3^{n} + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is built on the previous one with 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.

So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric progression, but the recurrence is a bit different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, since there are 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence relation, or using the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so the expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a geometric series or something similar here. Let me think about it. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. We have a_1 = 4. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in n=1: 4 = A*3 + B. Now, let's see for n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*9 + B. So, we have two equations: 4 = 3A + B 13 = 9A + B Subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = 9A + B - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general formula would be a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches a_3. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, using both the iterative step-by-step method and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.

But just to double-check, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, the layers are correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Therefore, equating terms: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated application of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a general formula for such a sequence. Let me denote a_n as the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. Here, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, actually, let me derive it. Let's write down the first few terms: a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_0) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_0 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*a_0) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_0 So, in general, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n*a_0. Wait, let me see. Wait, from the terms: a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 3*a_0 + 1 a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*(3*a_0 +1) +1 = 3^2*a_0 + 3 +1 a_3 = 3*a_2 +1 = 3*(3^2*a_0 +3 +1) +1 = 3^3*a_0 + 3^2 + 3 +1 So, in general, a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3 + 1). The sum in the parentheses is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^{n-1}. The sum of that series is (3^n - 1)/(3 -1) = (3^n -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^n -1)/2. Now, in our problem, a_0 would be the innermost term, which is 1, but wait, no. Wait, in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. So, perhaps in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is built upon that. So, to adjust the formula, if a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. So, in the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/2, but here, a_1 = 4, so perhaps a_0 is 1. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me try to define a_0 as the innermost term. Wait, in our problem, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, using the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/2, where a_0 is the initial term. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1, so a_1 = 3^1*a_0 + (3^1 -1)/2. Plugging in a_1 = 4: 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. Therefore, 3*a_0 = 3, so a_0 = 1. So, the formula is a_n = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} -1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that seems correct. Let me test it for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. I don't recall a specific formula for this, but perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar? Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assume a particular solution is a constant B. Then substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.

Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers. So, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of a_n, it would be 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So that's a more efficient way, using the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. It's good to see that both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if we can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the sum would be a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's nested, it's better to model it as the recurrence relation we did earlier. So, I think I've double-checked my work, and the answer seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I have an expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer, and it's repeated n times, then maybe there's a formula for it. Let me consider a general case where there are k layers. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. Then, L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^k, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k layers, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be L_9. So, according to the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, in this problem, we have 9 layers, which would correspond to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each layer. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n = 9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, since the recurrence is linear, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can set L_n = B, so substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1, L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using the formula for the nth layer, \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we find the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9, which is 29524. So, the expression is 3*a_9. Now, in general, for such a recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for a_9, that would be (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, but I think the step-by-step expansion is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so L_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula directly, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recurrence relation.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer step by step and see if the numbers make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I see. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the known layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, the outermost layer is layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me just confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Looking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(... So, yes, there are 9 layers, meaning L_9 is the outermost layer, which we computed as 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.\n2. **Compute each layer step by step**:\n   - Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n   - Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n   - Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n   - Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n   - Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n   - Layer 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n   - Layer 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n   - Layer 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n   - Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
