By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Use the result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n4.
