Let me count how many sets there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, it's another layer. Let me count: starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is part of a new layer. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: \n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each preceding one adds another layer. So, from the inside out, there are nine layers? Wait, let me check. \n\nLooking at the expression, each time after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis. So starting from the end, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then moving out, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost parentheses. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then the next layer is 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then the next is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding another 3(...).\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to approach it step by step. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, let's define each layer as a step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Step 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n- Step 2: Next layer out is 3 times the result of Step 1. So that's 3 * 4. Let me compute that: 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n- Step 3: Then, the next layer is 1 plus the result of Step 2. So that's 1 + 12. That equals 13.\n\n- Step 4: Then, 3 times the result of Step 3. So 3 * 13 = 39.\n\n- Step 5: Next, 1 plus 39, which is 40.\n\n- Step 6: 3 times 40 is 120.\n\n- Step 7: 1 plus 120 is 121.\n\n- Step 8: 3 times 121 is 363.\n\n- Step 9: 1 plus 363 is 364.\n\n- Step 10: 3 times 364 is 1092.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the steps correctly. Each time, I'm moving outward, so each step corresponds to a layer. Let me see: the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Because starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each 3(1 + ...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by parentheses. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Then each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count how many 3s there are:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside the entire expression.\n2. Then, inside that, there's another 3.\n3. Then another, and so on, until the innermost 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me see: starting from the left, the first 3 is followed by (1 + ...). Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...), and so on. Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression:\n\n- The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), where ... is another expression.\n\n- Inside that, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is at the very beginning.\n\n- Then, inside, we have another 3.\n\n- Let me count each time a new 3(...) occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s after the first one. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are eight more 3s, each starting a new layer. Wait, no, let me count:\n\n1. First, 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times the pattern 3(1 + ...) repeats. Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, which is (1 + 3), each time moving out, we have 3*(previous result) + 1. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work from the inside out. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses and then move outward, each time substituting the computed value into the next layer.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have: 3*(innermost result) + 1? Wait, no. Let me look at the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(inner result).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to number the layers from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, etc., up to Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me check: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try that.\n\nLet me list each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each time moving out, we have another layer, so up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I think I might have miscounted because each time I add a layer, I'm moving one step out, but perhaps I need to check how many layers there are.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside.\n2. Then, inside that, another 3.\n3. Let me see: each time, after a 3, there's an opening parenthesis. So, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n- After the first 3, there's (1 + 3(...)), which is the first inner layer.\n- Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), that's the first inner layer.\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), that's the second.\n3. Continuing, each time, so how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 more layers, each starting with 3(1 + ...). So, total layers from innermost to outermost would be 9. So, from Layer 1 (innermost) to Layer 9 (outermost).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, as I did before, to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me start over, computing each layer carefully:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. Because sometimes when you're dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers you have. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n\n2. 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the structure is:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute the expression without breaking it into layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute each innermost parentheses first:\n\nStarting with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the next layer is (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and computing each step carefully, we arrive at the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form `1 + 3*(next layer)`. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward simplifies the computation.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** `(1 + 3) = 4`\n\n3. **Proceed to Next Layers:**\n   Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer into the expression `1 + 3*(previous result)`.\n\n   - **Layer 2:** `1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13`\n   - **Layer 3:** `1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40`\n   - **Layer 4:** `1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121`\n   - **Layer 5:** `1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364`\n   - **Layer 6:** `1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093`\n   - **Layer 7:** `1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280`\n   - **Layer 8:** `1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841`\n   - **Layer 9:** `1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524`\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer:**\n   The entire expression is `3` multiplied by the result of Layer 9.\n\n   - **Final Computation:** `3*29524 = 88572`\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, if I start from the very inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 is 12. Then, we add 1 to that: 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I take the innermost parentheses, compute it, and then work my way outwards. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: 3*(result from step 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n3. Next level: 3*(result from step 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n4. Next level: 3*(result from step 3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n5. Next level: 3*(result from step 4) + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n6. Next level: 3*(result from step 5) + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n7. Next level: 3*(result from step 6) + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n8. Next level: 3*(result from step 7) + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n9. Next level: 3*(result from step 8) + 1 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(result from step 9) + 1 = 3*29524 + 1 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me recount the number of layers because I think I might have miscounted. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let me count how many layers there are. From the expression, I can see that after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each with their own closing ones. So, actually, there are 9 layers. Therefore, when I was computing step by step, I went through 9 layers, so my final result after 9 layers should be the innermost value, and then the outermost 3 times that plus 1. Wait, no, because the outermost operation is 3*(...). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me write down the layers:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, 3*(4) + 1 = 13\n3. Then, 3*(13) + 1 = 40\n4. Then, 3*(40) + 1 = 121\n5. Then, 3*(121) + 1 = 364\n6. Then, 3*(364) + 1 = 1093\n7. Then, 3*(1093) + 1 = 3280\n8. Then, 3*(3280) + 1 = 9841\n9. Then, 3*(9841) + 1 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) + 1 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), right? Because each time after the first 3, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, when I compute up to 29524, that's after 9 layers, and then the outermost operation is 3*(29524) which would be 88572, and then adding 1 would make it 88573. Wait, but in the original problem, is the outermost operation just 3*(...) without an additional +1? Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), and inside that, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, up to 9 layers. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(result of the 9th layer). So, perhaps I went one step too far in my previous calculation. Let me try again, this time being careful about the number of layers.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing up to Layer 9, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, if there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), then the final result is 3*(result after 9 layers). So, in this case, 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I had an extra +1, making it 88573. But that might be incorrect because the outermost operation is just 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). Let me verify.\n\nLooking back at the problem: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 10?), but wait, no, because the innermost is Layer 9: (1 + 3). So, perhaps the outermost is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572, without adding 1. So, maybe my initial calculation was wrong because I added an extra +1 at the end.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer after the first 3 is of the form (1 + 3*(next layer)), and there are 9 such layers. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572, not 88573 as I thought earlier. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation by adding an extra 1 at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", meaning 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, the computation should indeed stop at 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller version to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nBut let's compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct. So, in this smaller case, we have 3 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost is 3*(result). So, similarly, in the original problem, with 9 layers, the result should be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went one step further, adding 1 to 29524, which I shouldn't have done because the outermost operation is just 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check with another small example to be sure. Let's take 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nYes, correct. So, the outermost operation is just 3*(...), not adding 1 again. So, in the original problem, after computing the 9th layer as 29524, the outermost operation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 88573 because I added 1 at the end, but that was incorrect. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times I have to compute 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWe can find B by setting up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general term is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 88573, but that was because I mistakenly added 1 at the end, thinking there was an extra layer, but the formula shows that after 9 layers, it's 29524, and then the outermost 3* that is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, with n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write this down step by step. The innermost part of the expression is the last (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Got that. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next level out gives me 13. \n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that. 3*13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40. Hmm, so now I have 40. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the next level is 1 + 3*40. Let's see, 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. That's a nice number, 121. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Adding 1 gives me 364. So now, I have 364. \n\nNext, another layer out: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, now I'm at 1093. \n\nMoving out another level, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. I can break this down: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. \n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives me 9841. So, now I have 9841. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. \n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, 3*9841: 9841 times 3. Let me do it another way to verify. 9841 * 3: 1*3 is 3, 4*3 is 12, carry over the 1. 8*3 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, carry over the 2. 9*3 is 27, plus the carried 2 is 29. So, writing it out: 29523. Then adding 1 gives me 29524. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. \n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, no carryover.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, it's 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. Let me break it down: 3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 240000 +24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. \n\nWait, let me verify that by another method. 88573 *3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n88573\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n3*3=9\n3*7=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2. Wait, but 88573 has only five digits, so after the last 8, there's no more digits. So, the last carry over 2 would be added as a new digit. So, it's 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute 3*265720. Hmm, 3*200000=600000, 3*60000=180000, 3*5000=15000, 3*700=2100, 3*20=60. Adding those together: 600000 +180000=780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161. \n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 265720 *3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n265720\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n0*3=0\n2*3=6\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n6*3=18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\nSo, writing it out: 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, the expression is 1 + 3*797161. Let me compute 3*797161. Hmm, 3*700000=2100000, 3*90000=270000, 3*7000=21000, 3*100=300, 3*60=180, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 2100000 +270000=2370000, +21000=2391000, +300=2391300, +180=2391480, +3=2391483. Then, adding 1 gives me 2391484. \n\nWait, let me verify that. 797161 *3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n797161\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2.\nThere's no more digits, so the carry over 2 is added as a new digit. So, the result is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. Correct.\n\nSo, now I've computed all the layers, starting from the innermost (1+3) up to the outermost layer. The final result inside the parentheses is 2391484. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, I need to compute 3*2391484. Let me do that.\n\n3*2391484. Let me break it down:\n\n3*2000000=6000000\n3*300000=900000\n3*90000=270000\n3*1000=3000\n3*400=1200\n3*80=240\n3*4=12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n6000000 +900000=6900000\n6900000 +270000=7170000\n7170000 +3000=7173000\n7173000 +1200=7174200\n7174200 +240=7174440\n7174440 +12=7174452\n\nWait, let me verify that again. 2391484 *3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n2391484\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n1*3=3 +1=4\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n3*3=9 +2=11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\nSo, writing it out: 7174452. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 7,174,452. Wait, but let me check the count of the layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, I did nine layers, right? Let me recount the steps I did:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4\n2. Next: 1 +3*4=13\n3. Next: 1 +3*13=40\n4. Next: 1 +3*40=121\n5. Next: 1 +3*121=364\n6. Next: 1 +3*364=1093\n7. Next: 1 +3*1093=3280\n8. Next: 1 +3*3280=9841\n9. Next: 1 +3*9841=29524\n10. Next: 1 +3*29524=88573\n11. Next: 1 +3*88573=265720\n12. Next: 1 +3*265720=797161\n13. Next: 1 +3*797161=2391484\n14. Finally, 3*2391484=7174452\n\nWait, so I did 13 layers? But the problem had nine sets of parentheses. Let me check the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then nine layers of (1+3(...)). So, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3*...). So, the number of layers is nine. Let me recount my steps:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4 (1st layer)\n2. 1 +3*4=13 (2nd layer)\n3. 1 +3*13=40 (3rd layer)\n4. 1 +3*40=121 (4th layer)\n5. 1 +3*121=364 (5th layer)\n6. 1 +3*364=1093 (6th layer)\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280 (7th layer)\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841 (8th layer)\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524 (9th layer)\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(result from 9th layer)=3*29524=88572? Wait, no, that can't be right because earlier I continued beyond that. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left: 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). The innermost is the last (1+3). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's nine sets of (1+3(...)). So, each layer adds another (1+3*...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*4)=13\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*13)=40\n\nLayer 4: (1+3*40)=121\n\nLayer 5: (1+3*121)=364\n\nLayer 6: (1+3*364)=1093\n\nLayer 7: (1+3*1093)=3280\n\nLayer 8: (1+3*3280)=9841\n\nLayer 9: (1+3*9841)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, that's different from what I did earlier. So, perhaps I overstepped and continued beyond the required layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first (1+3(...)) is layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...)) is another layer. So, let's see:\n\n- 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9, as there are nine sets of (1+3(...)) inside the main 3*(...). Therefore, after computing up to layer 9, which gives me 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I went beyond that, computing up to 7,174,452, which seems incorrect because the original expression only has nine layers. So, I think I made a mistake by continuing beyond the ninth layer. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer (layer 1): (1+3)=4\n\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4)=1+12=13\n\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13)=1+39=40\n\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40)=1+120=121\n\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121)=1+363=364\n\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364)=1+1092=1093\n\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093)=1+3279=3280\n\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280)=1+9840=9841\n\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(result from layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I computed 3*(29524)=88572, which is correct. So, why did I go beyond that? I think I miscounted the layers earlier, thinking there were more, but actually, it's only nine layers, so the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again: 29524 *3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. Therefore, the problem is solved by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, resulting in 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " So, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: Innermost: (1 + 3). So, that's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is: 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Since the innermost was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Let me write down the results so far:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nI think each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next value. So, let me continue this process step by step until I reach the outermost parentheses. Let's do that.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. So, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 88572 + 1 is 88573.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that last calculation again. 3*29524: Let me compute it another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 2*3 is 6, 9*3 is 27, 5*3 is 15, 2*3 is 6, 4*3 is 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way because each digit is in a different place value. Actually, let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute that. First, 3*88573. Let me break it down:\n\n80,000 * 3 = 240,000\n8,000 * 3 = 24,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n70 * 3 = 210\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nAdding these together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000\n264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500\n265,500 + 210 = 265,710\n265,710 + 9 = 265,719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives 265,720.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check it another way. 88,573 * 3: 80,000 *3 is 240,000; 8,000*3 is 24,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 70*3 is 210; 3*3 is 9. So, adding all those: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Then, 265,719 + 1 = 265,720. Hmm, okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*265,720. Let's compute 3*265,720 first. 200,000*3 is 600,000; 60,000*3 is 180,000; 5,000*3 is 15,000; 700*3 is 2,100; 20*3 is 60. Adding these together:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160\n\nSo, 3*265,720 is 797,160. Then, adding 1 gives 797,161.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*797,161. Let's compute 3*797,161. Breaking it down:\n\n700,000 *3 = 2,100,000\n90,000 *3 = 270,000\n7,000 *3 = 21,000\n100 *3 = 300\n60 *3 = 180\n1 *3 = 3\n\nAdding these together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161 is 2,391,483. Adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*2,391,484. Let's compute 3*2,391,484. Let me break it down:\n\n2,000,000 *3 = 6,000,000\n300,000 *3 = 900,000\n90,000 *3 = 270,000\n1,000 *3 = 3,000\n400 *3 = 1,200\n80 *3 = 240\n4 *3 = 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\n\nSo, 3*2,391,484 = 7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*7,174,453. Let's compute 3*7,174,453.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n7,000,000 *3 = 21,000,000\n100,000 *3 = 300,000\n70,000 *3 = 210,000\n4,000 *3 = 12,000\n400 *3 = 1,200\n50 *3 = 150\n3 *3 = 9\n\nAdding these together:\n\n21,000,000 + 300,000 = 21,300,000\n21,300,000 + 210,000 = 21,510,000\n21,510,000 + 12,000 = 21,522,000\n21,522,000 + 1,200 = 21,523,200\n21,523,200 + 150 = 21,523,350\n21,523,350 + 9 = 21,523,359\n\nSo, 3*7,174,453 is 21,523,359. Adding 1 gives 21,523,360.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(result from the previous step). So, the entire expression is 3 times this last result. So, we have 3*21,523,360.\n\nLet me compute that. 21,523,360 *3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20,000,000 *3 = 60,000,000\n1,000,000 *3 = 3,000,000\n500,000 *3 = 1,500,000\n20,000 *3 = 60,000\n3,000 *3 = 9,000\n300 *3 = 900\n60 *3 = 180\n0 *3 = 0\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60,000,000 + 3,000,000 = 63,000,000\n63,000,000 + 1,500,000 = 64,500,000\n64,500,000 + 60,000 = 64,560,000\n64,560,000 + 9,000 = 64,569,000\n64,569,000 + 900 = 64,569,900\n64,569,900 + 180 = 64,570,080\n64,570,080 + 0 = 64,570,080\n\nSo, 3*21,523,360 is 64,570,080.\n\nWait, let me verify that with a different method. 21,523,360 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0*3 = 0\n\n6*3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n3*3 = 9, plus 1 is 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n3*3 = 9, plus 1 is 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n0*3 = 0, plus 1 is 1, write down 1.\n\n2*3 = 6\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n21,523,360\n\u00d7          3\n------------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n0 *3 = 0\n\n6 *3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n3 *3 = 9 +1 =10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n3 *3 = 9 +1 =10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n0 *3 = 0 +1 =1.\n\n2 *3 =6.\n\n3 *3 =9.\n\n5 *3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3 =6 +1=7.\n\n1 *3 =3.\n\nSo, putting it together: 64,570,080. Okay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the final result is 64,570,080.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 21,523,360 *3 using another method. 20,000,000*3 is 60,000,000. 1,523,360*3: Let's compute that. 1,000,000*3 is 3,000,000. 523,360*3: 500,000*3=1,500,000; 23,360*3=70,080. So, 1,500,000 +70,080=1,570,080. Adding all together: 60,000,000 +3,000,000=63,000,000; 63,000,000 +1,570,080=64,570,080. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after working through each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I end up with the final result of 64,570,080. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down one step at a time helped prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value inside the parentheses and substituting it into the next layer. Repeating this process for each layer eventually leads to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Next Layer:**\n    - Compute 1 + 3\u00d729524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\n11. **Next Layer:**\n    - Compute 1 + 3\u00d788573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\n12. **Next Layer:**\n    - Compute 1 + 3\u00d7265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161.\n\n13. **Next Layer:**\n    - Compute 1 + 3\u00d7797161 = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\n14. **Next Layer:**\n    - Compute 1 + 3\u00d72391484 = 1 + 7174452 = 7174453.\n\n15. **Outermost Layer:**\n    - Multiply the result by 3: 3\u00d77174453 = 21523359.\n\n16. **Final Step:**\n    - The entire expression is 3 times the result from step 15: 3\u00d721523359 = 64570080.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{64570080}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's write this out step by step. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me try to identify how many layers there are. I count nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 plus 3 times another. So, that means I have to compute from the innermost one, which is the ninth layer, and then each time substitute that result back into the previous layer. \n\nLet me write this out in a more manageable way. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, all the way up to Level 9, where Level 9 is the innermost one. So, starting with Level 9, which is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so Level 9 is 4. Now, moving one level out, Level 8 is 1 + 3 times Level 9. Since Level 9 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Level 8 is 13. \n\nNext, Level 7 is 1 + 3 times Level 8. Level 8 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Level 7 is 40. Moving on to Level 6, which is 1 + 3 times Level 7. Level 7 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 6 is 121. \n\nLevel 5 is 1 + 3 times Level 6. Level 6 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Level 5 is 364. \n\nLevel 4 is 1 + 3 times Level 5. Level 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3 times 364 is... let's see, 300 times 3 is 900, and 64 times 3 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, plus 1 is 1093. So, Level 4 is 1093. \n\nMoving to Level 3, which is 1 + 3 times Level 4. Level 4 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3 times 1093: 1000 times 3 is 3000, 93 times 3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. So, Level 3 is 3280. \n\nLevel 2 is 1 + 3 times Level 3. Level 3 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3 times 3280: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 280 times 3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841. So, Level 2 is 9841. \n\nFinally, Level 1 is the outermost one, which is 1 + 3 times Level 2. Level 2 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3 times 9841: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 841 times 3 is... 800 times 3 is 2400, 41 times 3 is 123, so 2400 + 123 is 2523. Then, adding that to 27000: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. So, Level 1 is 29524. \n\nBut wait, hold on a second. The original problem is 3 multiplied by this big expression. So, after computing Level 1 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 times 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 times 3: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. \n\nWait, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each level to make sure I didn't miscalculate anywhere.\n\nStarting from Level 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1092 + 1=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let me compute this again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each level manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each level is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3*... and so on. Wait, but actually, the innermost level is a_9 = 1 + 3, then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, and so on up to a_1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. \n\nI recall that such recurrence relations can be solved using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where in this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c). Wait, but in this case, a_9 is the innermost term, which is 1 + 3, so a_9 = 4. Then, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, if I can express this as a recurrence starting from a_9, then perhaps I can find a formula for a_1 in terms of a_9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from a_9 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It's like each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2. Wait, let me check: a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. If I think of a_8 = 3*a_9 +1, then a_7 = 3*a_8 +1, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence relation. Let me try that.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say we start from a_9 = 4. So, when n=9, a_9 = A*3^9 - 1/2 = 4.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, A*19683 - 1/2 = 4 => A*19683 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/19683 = 9/(2*19683) = 9/39366 = 1/4374.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (1/4374)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find a_1, which is the outermost term. So, n=1.\n\na_1 = (1/4374)*3^1 - 1/2 = (3)/4374 - 1/2 = 1/1458 - 1/2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because when n=9, a_9 is 4, but according to this formula, a_9 would be (1/4374)*19683 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 19683 / 4374 = 4.5. So, 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct. So, the formula works for n=9.\n\nBut when n=1, a_1 = (1/4374)*3 - 1/2 = (3)/4374 - 1/2 = 1/1458 - 1/2.\n\nWait, that gives a negative number, which doesn't make sense because all the a_n terms are positive. So, maybe I messed up the indexing. Perhaps I should have started counting n from 0 instead of 9.\n\nLet me redefine the problem. Let's say that a_0 = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 13, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 40, and so on up to a_8, which would be the outermost term. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8.\n\nSo, with a_0 = 4, and the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1 for n >=1.\n\nUsing the same approach, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nApplying the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1 => A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. Same as before.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_0 = 4: A*3^0 + B = A + (-1/2) = 4 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find a_8, since the outermost term is a_8, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, a_8 = (9/2)*3^8 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_8 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2.\n\nCompute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute 10*6561=65610, minus 1*6561=6561, so 65610 - 6561=59049. Then, 59049 / 2 = 29524.5.\n\nThen, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_8 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer and then verifying with a formula helped solidify that the answer is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the inner layer into the outer one. Using both step-by-step computation and a recurrence relation approach, the result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the very last (1+3). So, I should start by computing that. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Since the innermost gave us 4, let's compute that next layer:\n\nSecond innermost: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now we have 13. Moving out another layer, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, let's compute that:\n\nThird innermost: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let me keep track of each step so I don't get lost. So far, we've got 4, 13, and 40. Let's proceed to the next layer:\n\nFourth innermost: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWhoa, that's a jump. 121. Okay, moving on to the next layer:\n\nFifth innermost: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWow, these numbers are increasing rapidly. Let me write these down as I go along to make sure I don't make a mistake. So, fifth innermost is 364. Next layer:\n\nSixth innermost: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nOkay, 1093. That's a pretty big number. Let's continue:\n\nSeventh innermost: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nHmm, 3280. Next layer:\n\nEighth innermost: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWow, that's a huge number. Let me just check my calculations so far to make sure I haven't messed up. So starting from the inside:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So the eighth innermost layer gives us 9841. Now, moving out another layer, the next part of the expression is:\n\nNinth innermost: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that calculation. 3 times 9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Yes, that's right.\n\nSo, now, the entire expression is built up from these layers. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth innermost expression. Let me write that down:\n\nOutermost expression: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nSo, 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3).\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n24 * 3 = 72.\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. So, 29524 * 3. Let me compute it another way:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has multiple layers of parentheses. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time I worked my way out, I did 9 layers in total. Let me check the original problem again:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, there's a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(...)\".\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3*(previous), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the last one, and each previous layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, the first opening parenthesis is after the 3, then each subsequent opening parenthesis is after each 1+3.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 opening parentheses, which means 9 layers. Therefore, I correctly computed 9 layers, each time working from the innermost outward. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed, I ended up with 88572, but let me just verify once more to be absolutely sure.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each step seems to check out, and I didn't skip any layers. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try computing it in a different way, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That looks like a geometric sequence or something similar. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the nth term, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, since each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used two different methods (direct computation and finding a general formula), and both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result.

Use this result to compute the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer until reaching the ninth layer.\n4.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write this down more clearly to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with 1 + 3 times another expression. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, actually, wait. Let me check the original expression again. The very outermost part is 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, which continues until the innermost one is 1 + 3. So, actually, there are nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nAlright, let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1 is the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Therefore, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let me calculate that. 9841 * 3. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, L(1) is 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw. Then L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what we have. So, in general, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such recursions can often be solved using a formula. Let me recall the formula for such a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a and b are constants. In our case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nL(n) = (L(1) - b/(1 - a)) * a^(n-1) + b/(1 - a)\n\nWait, let me make sure I remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, for a linear recurrence of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL(n) = a^(n-1) * L(1) + b*(a^(n-1) - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nActually, the standard solution for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is:\n\nIf a \u2260 1,\n\nL(n) = a^(n-1) * L(1) + b*( (a^(n-1) - 1)/(a - 1) )\n\nSo, in our case, a = 3, b = 1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nL(n) = 3^(n-1) * 4 + 1*( (3^(n-1) - 1)/(3 - 1) )\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL(n) = 4*3^(n-1) + (3^(n-1) - 1)/2\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nLet me factor out 3^(n-1):\n\nL(n) = 3^(n-1)*(4 + 1/2) - 1/2\n\nWait, 4 + 1/2 is 9/2, so:\n\nL(n) = (9/2)*3^(n-1) - 1/2\n\nAlternatively, 3^(n-1) is equal to 3^(n)/3, so:\n\nL(n) = (9/2)*(3^n / 3) - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, 4*3^(n-1) + (3^(n-1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me write 4 as 8/2 to have a common denominator:\n\n= (8/2)*3^(n-1) + (3^(n-1) - 1)/2\n\n= [8*3^(n-1) + 3^(n-1) - 1]/2\n\n= [9*3^(n-1) - 1]/2\n\nBut 9*3^(n-1) is 3^2 * 3^(n-1) = 3^(n+1)\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nWait, that's a neat formula. Let me check if this works with our earlier layers.\n\nFor n = 1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 4: L(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so this formula works for the layers we've already computed. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n = 9, we can use this formula to compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = L(9) = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute Layer 9 directly, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step without making a mistake, both methods lead to the same result. It's reassuring to see that both approaches give the same answer, which adds confidence in the solution.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer iteratively or using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this pattern, we can use a closed-form formula to compute the innermost layers efficiently. The formula for the nth layer is L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Applying this to the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the pattern: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Use the closed-form formula for the nth layer: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n3. Compute Layer 9: L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving one step out, the next parentheses is 1 plus 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next parentheses. So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each step is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next step). \n\nLet me try to write this down step by step to keep track. Let's define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Let's see, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one level. Then each time we go out, we add another level. So, let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n\n2. Next level out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses. So, after computing the innermost part up to the ninth level, which gives me 29524, I then need to multiply that by 3. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3 * 29,524 = ?\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me double-check my calculations. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps when computing each level. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with larger numbers. Let me go through each level again to confirm.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27,000 + 2400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Level 9 is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, which is 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the levels or misapply the multiplication.\n\nLet me count how many times I have the 3 multiplied. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first level. Each subsequent level adds another 3*(...). So, let's count the number of 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3)\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost one, which is the 9th level. So, yes, we have 9 levels of 3*(1 + ...). So, each step is correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Level 9, which is 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Level 9). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without having to go through each level step by step, which might be time-consuming, especially if there are more levels. But in this case, since there are only nine levels, it's manageable.\n\nWait, let me think about whether there's a formula for such nested expressions. This seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost term, and a_9 is the outermost term before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where r is the common ratio and B is a constant term. Let me try to solve this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1\n\nB = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nWait, because n = 9, so n+1 = 10.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177,147, so (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, that confirms that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me verify it with a smaller number of levels. Let's take n=1, which is the innermost term.\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the lower levels, so it's likely correct for n=9 as well.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each level is 1 + 3 times the previous level. So, starting from 4, each subsequent level is 1 + 3*previous. So, as we computed step by step, each level builds on the previous one, and after nine such steps, we get to 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked this enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each level is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each level's value is calculated. After computing all nine levels, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost value by 3, leading to the solution.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. For each subsequent level, compute 1 + 3*(previous result).\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is $(1+3)$. So, I'll compute that first. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: $1 + 3 = 4$\n\nOkay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where \"something\" is the result we just got, which is 4. Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(4)$\n\nWait, 3 times 4 is 12, so:\n\n$1 + 12 = 13$\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next parentheses would be $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where \"something\" is now 13. Let's compute that:\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(13)$\n\n3 times 13 is 39, so:\n\n$1 + 39 = 40$\n\nHmm, so that's 40.

Next layer out: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$ where \"something\" is 121. Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(121)$\n\n3 times 121 is 363, so:\n\n$1 + 363 = 364$\n\nAlright, moving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$ with \"something\" being 364. Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(364)$\n\n3 times 364 is 1092, so:\n\n$1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nOkay, so that's 1093.

Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(3280)$\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, so:\n\n$1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nAlright, so that's 9841. Now, moving out another layer, the next parentheses is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$ where \"something\" is 9841. Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(9841)$\n\n3 times 9841 is... let me calculate that. 9841 times 3: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3 times 9841 is 29523. Then, adding 1:\n\n$1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nSo, that layer simplifies to 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, the outermost part is $3 \\times 29524$.

Let's compute 29524 times 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 times 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 times 3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 times 3 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 times 3 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 times 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved computing the innermost expression, substituting it into the next layer, and so on, until we reached the outermost layer, which was 3 times the last computed value. \n\nLet me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Outermost: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's 10 steps. Let me count the number of layers to make sure. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), and each time, another (1+3(...) is added. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3))\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, that means there are 9 layers, each adding another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 10 steps, starting from 4 up to 88572. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time, we have a new (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time another (1+3(...)) is added.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3) starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer is (1+3(...)), so how many layers are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times we have a (1+3(...) expression. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each time adding another (1+3(...)). So, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier counting, thinking there were 10 layers. So, if there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so my steps should be 9 layers, each time computing the innermost first.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 steps, starting from 4 and ending at 88572. So, perhaps I overcounted. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the layers are defined. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me assign each layer a number, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then moving outward.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*(Layer3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*(Layer4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*(Layer5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*(Layer6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*(Layer7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*(Layer8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each from 1 to 9, and the outermost operation is 3 times layer9. So, my initial step-by-step had 9 layers plus the outermost 3 times, making 10 steps in total, but perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 10 steps, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572. That's 9 layers plus the outermost 3 times, making 10 computations. But perhaps the confusion is in whether the outermost 3 times is considered a separate layer or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the better way is to consider that the expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, the computation would involve computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, then moving outward, and finally multiplying the result by 3.\n\nLet me try to write this out clearly, assigning each layer to a variable to make it easier.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, each layer builds upon the previous one, starting from L1 up to L9, and then the final result is 3 times L9.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, each step checks out, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's say that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in such a recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using a formula.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D + 1\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works for the first few terms.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result without manually computing each layer, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing the pattern as a geometric series can help. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on. But in this case, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, whether by step-by-step computation or by using the recurrence formula, the result is the same: 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step, and all the computations seem correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the result to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue substituting each result into the next outer layer:\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Finally, multiply the outermost result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 followed by a parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), then\n2. The next layer is 3(1 + 3), then\n3. Then 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)),\n4. Then 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))),\n5. Continuing this way, up to 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of times the pattern repeats, it's 9 times. Let me check: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then moving out, each step adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as 9 layers.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, but maybe it's better to start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step, then build up the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just compute each nested part step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's straightforward.\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So the next layer is:\n\n3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nWait, but actually, the next layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me correct that.\n\nWait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + result of the inner layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought before. Wait, so let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misapplied it. Let me see. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + that 4), so 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me verify this step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer as I compute them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Wait, the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), right? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nStarting from the outermost 3, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each 3*(1 + ...) is a new layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(1 + ...): each time we have a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s inside the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is built as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each step adds a 3*(1 + ...). Let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3). Then moving out, we have 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + (1 + 3))), etc. So, each time we add another layer, it's 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the number of layers is 9, as the expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I started computing, I got to the 9th layer as 36084. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\n1. Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\n3. Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\n4. Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\n5. Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\n6. Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\n7. Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\n8. Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\n9. Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nHmm, so according to this, the final result would be 36084. But let me check each step again because sometimes when you're doing repetitive calculations, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49. 49*3 is 147. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420+24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3:\n\n1000*3=3000,\n\n300*3=900,\n\n30*3=90,\n\n6*3=18.\n\nSo 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009.\n\nCompute 4000*3=12000,\n\n9*3=27.\n\nSo 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028.\n\nCompute 12000*3=36000,\n\n28*3=84.\n\nSo 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nOkay, so after recomputing each layer, I confirm that each step is correct. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try an alternative approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer. Since each layer is defined as 3*(1 + previous layer), perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nI notice that each L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to expand this:\n\nL1 = 4.\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3 + 3*L1 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15.\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3 + 3*L2 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48.\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147.\n\nHmm, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * (L0) + (b*(a^{n} - 1))/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, but in our case, L1 = 4. So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, let me think. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, with L1 = c.\n\nThe solution is L_n = a^{n-1} * c + b*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nLet me verify that.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = a^{0}*c + b*(a^{0} - 1)/(a - 1) = c + b*(1 - 1)/(a - 1) = c + 0 = c. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = a^{1}*c + b*(a^{1} - 1)/(a - 1) = a*c + b*(a - 1)/(a - 1) = a*c + b. Which matches our recurrence: L2 = a*L1 + b.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: L3 = a^2*c + b*(a^2 - 1)/(a - 1) = a^2*c + b*(a + 1). Which should be equal to a*L2 + b = a*(a*c + b) + b = a^2*c + a*b + b = a^2*c + b*(a + 1). Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nIn our case, a = 3, b = 3, c = L1 = 4.\n\nSo, the general solution for L_n is:\n\nL_n = 3^{n - 1} * 4 + 3*(3^{n - 1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 4*3^{n - 1} + (3*(3^{n - 1} - 1))/2\n\n= 4*3^{n - 1} + (3^{n} - 3)/2\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\n= (8*3^{n - 1} + 3^{n} - 3)/2\n\nBut 8*3^{n - 1} is equal to (8/3)*3^n, so:\n\n= ((8/3)*3^n + 3^n - 3)/2\n\n= ( (8/3 + 3) * 3^n - 3 ) / 2\n\nBut 8/3 + 3 = 8/3 + 9/3 = 17/3\n\nSo,\n\n= ( (17/3)*3^n - 3 ) / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (17*3^{n - 1} - 3)/2\n\nWait, because (17/3)*3^n = 17*3^{n -1}.\n\nSo, L_n = (17*3^{n -1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (17*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (17*1 - 3)/2 = (14)/2 = 7. Wait, but L1 is 4. That's not matching. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation.\n\nWait, let me go back. The standard formula is L_n = a^{n -1} * c + b*(a^{n -1} - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nIn our case, a=3, b=3, c=4.\n\nSo,\n\nL_n = 3^{n -1} *4 + 3*(3^{n -1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\n= 4*3^{n -1} + (3*(3^{n -1} -1))/2\n\nSo, let me compute for n=1:\n\n= 4*3^{0} + (3*(3^{0} -1))/2\n\n= 4*1 + (3*(1 -1))/2\n\n= 4 + 0 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\n=4*3^{1} + (3*(3^{1} -1))/2\n\n=4*3 + (3*(3 -1))/2\n\n=12 + (3*2)/2\n\n=12 + 6/2\n\n=12 + 3 =15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n=4*3^2 + (3*(3^2 -1))/2\n\n=4*9 + (3*(9 -1))/2\n\n=36 + (3*8)/2\n\n=36 + 24/2\n\n=36 +12=48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n=4*27 + (3*(27 -1))/2\n\n=108 + (3*26)/2\n\n=108 + 78/2\n\n=108 +39=147. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L9 would be:\n\nL9 =4*3^{8} + (3*(3^{8} -1))/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo,\n\nL9=4*6561 + (3*(6561 -1))/2\n\n=4*6561 + (3*6560)/2\n\nCompute each part:\n\n4*6561: 4*6000=24000, 4*561=2244, so total is 24000+2244=26244.\n\n(3*6560)/2: 3*6560=19680, then divided by 2 is 9840.\n\nSo, L9=26244 + 9840=36084.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using the concept of a geometric series or recognizing a pattern that can be summed up.\n\nWait, another approach: Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), so each layer is 3 + 3*previous layer.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 3. So, the sequence is 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, etc., each time multiplied by 3 and added 3.\n\nBut I think the approach I took earlier is sufficient. I've cross-verified using the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, both leading to the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from the innermost as \\( L_1 \\).\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3). That's the starting point. So, let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, I need to compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. So, after computing the innermost (1+3)=4, the next step is to compute the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so now we have 40. Let me keep track of each step to avoid confusion. So far, we've simplified three layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nSo, each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Let me try to see how many layers there are in total. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...). Let me see, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent 3(1+3(...) is nested inside. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n1. The first 3(1+3(...)) has an innermost (1+3)\n2. Then each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let me look at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3\" is inside another 3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3\" parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) includes the previous result.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count how many times 1+3 is used. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses minus one, perhaps? Let me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(...), each subsequent 3(...) is nested inside. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at it:\n\n1. The first 3(1+3(....))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(....))\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3*(...) until we reach the outermost 3(...). So, let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3(, so each time, that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time, we have another 3(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write down the structure:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, hold on, that seems too big. Maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it step by step, layer by layer, making sure I compute each correctly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out:\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext layer:\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext layer:\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext layer:\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext layer:\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, that seems very large. Let me check that again. 3*1093 is indeed 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext layer:\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext layer:\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n\nL10: 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems way too large. Let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears inside.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, each time, another 3*(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, not 10. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see:\n\n- The first layer: (1+3) = 4\n- Then, moving out, each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we can nest 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...), so each time, that's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" terms:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, we have:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, 3*(1+3(...))\n3. Repeating until the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of \"1+3\" instances. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, each layer adds another 3*(1+3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, the expression is built as follows:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each 3*(1+3(...)) includes the previous result. So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3\" is inside another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(1+3(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. Then, 3*(1+3(...))\n3. Repeating until the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3(, each subsequent ( is an opening parenthesis, so:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3)\n3. (1+3)\n4. (1+3)\n5. (1+3)\n6. (1+3)\n7. (1+3)\n8. (1+3)\n9. (1+3)\n\nWait, but that's 9 opening parentheses, but each is nested inside the previous one, so the number of layers is 9. Therefore, starting from L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but when I did the calculation earlier, I went up to L10, which might be incorrect. Let me try again, ensuring that I have the correct number of layers.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then I should compute from L1 to L9, and then the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, perhaps the outermost is the initial 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9, each corresponding to the innermost (1+3) up to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it as starting from the innermost and working outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, after computing L9, we have the result of the innermost 9 layers. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, the final step is:\n\nTotal = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication by 3:\n\n3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. Therefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\nand so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each layer adds 1 before multiplying, it's a bit more complex. However, using the recurrence relation approach makes it manageable.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to recognize that each layer is building a number that can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, since we have 9 layers, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using a recurrence relation, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By systematically simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result, leading to the final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The \"something\" is another 3 multiplied by (1 plus another something). This repeats until the innermost part, which is just (1 + 3). Wait, let me check that. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Because if I count the number of opening parentheses, there are nine of them, so each level adds one more. So starting from the innermost, which is the ninth level, and moving outward.\n\nMaybe it would help if I label each level from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9. Let me try that.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (1 + ...), so that would be Level 9, right? Because the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression. So according to my calculation, the result should be 36,084. But let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Level 1: (1 + 3) is indeed 4. Then Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. Level 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Still correct. Level 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Yes. Level 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420+24=444. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let me compute 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let me calculate 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27. So 12,000 + 27 = 12,027. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Let's compute this: 10,000*3=30,000, 2,000*3=6,000, 28*3=84. So 30,000 + 6,000 = 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. That seems right.\n\nSo, each level builds on the previous one, and it's just a matter of computing each step carefully. I think I did each multiplication correctly, but let me just double-check one or two steps to be sure.\n\nLet me recheck Level 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. Level 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula, but since it's only nine levels, maybe working step by step is manageable. I don't see an immediate formula, but perhaps if I think about it recursively. Each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So if I let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to a_9 = 36,084. That seems consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as a geometric series or something similar, but considering each step is 3*(1 + previous), it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write it as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3*A - 3/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3*A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nThus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, maybe better to express it as:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nLet me compute a_1 using this formula: (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, compute a_2: (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\na_3: (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - (3/2) = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\na_4: (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = (297/2) - (3/2) = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, we need a_9, since the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), which corresponds to a_9.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nFirst, compute 3^9. Let's see: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19,683.\n\nNow, (11/6)*19,683. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 19,683 divided by 6: 19,683 \u00f7 6 = 3,280.5.\n\nThen, multiply by 11: 3,280.5 * 11.\n\nCompute 3,280 * 11 = 36,080.\n\nCompute 0.5 * 11 = 5.5.\n\nSo, total is 36,080 + 5.5 = 36,085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 from this: 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. Therefore, the answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me just verify the formula again because when I computed a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, plugging in n=9 gives me 36,084, which is consistent with my manual computation. So, that gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think to model it as a recurrence relation, just computing each level step by step would have taken a bit longer but still arrived at the same result. Either way, the answer is 36,084.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me recount the levels to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...\" is a new level. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 levels. So yes, 9 levels in total, which corresponds to a_9 in the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each level is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next level). By evaluating each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the result is 36,084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) and working outward.\n\n2. **Evaluate each level:**\n   - **Level 1:** (1 + 3) = 4\n   - **Level 2:** 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - **Level 3:** 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - **Level 4:** 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - **Level 5:** 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - **Level 6:** 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - **Level 7:** 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - **Level 8:** 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - **Level 9:** 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Conclusion:** The value of the entire expression is 36,084.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost parentheses is (1+3). Let me write that down. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking again, each expression is 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, each time, we're dealing with 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the inside, each step depends on the previous one. Let me try to write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1 result). So, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so Level 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Level 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result). So, 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result). That's 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result). So, 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result). That's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, Level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result). So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, Level 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result). That would be 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times the entire expression, right? Because the whole thing is wrapped in a 3*(...). So, after computing Level 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9 result). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Let me check 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each digit multiplied by 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 29524*3 another way. Maybe breaking it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nAdding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each level step by step. Since each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each level step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same answer. Either way, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I was able to compute each level step by step and then multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer. Using a closed-form formula also confirmed the result, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly, double-checked my calculations, and even used two different methods to confirm the result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level of the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). By calculating each level step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way out, eventually multiplying the outermost result by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n1. Innermost level: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let me try to parse this expression. Starting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1+3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, the next level out simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving another level out, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40. So, that level simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this process, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that, 3 times 40 is 120, and adding 1 gives me 121. So, that level becomes 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute 3 times 121 first. Hmm, 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, that level is 364.\n\nContinuing, the next expression is 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3 times 364. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that level is 1093.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3 times 1093. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that level simplifies to 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, and 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that level is 9841.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3 times 9841. 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that level simplifies to 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let's calculate 3 times 29524. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that level is 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3 times 88573. 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. So, that level simplifies to 265720.\n\nWait a minute, but the entire original expression is 3 times that outermost result. So, after simplifying all the inner parentheses, the outermost expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that. 265720 times 3. Let's break it down: 200000 times 3 is 600000, 60000 times 3 is 180000, 5000 times 3 is 15000, 700 times 3 is 2100, 20 times 3 is 60, and 0 times 3 is 0. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160, plus 0 is 797160. So, 3 times 265720 is 797160.\n\nWait, that seems like a very large number, but considering how many layers of multiplication there are, it might be correct. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. 3*265720 = 797160\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the very first step which was just 1+3. Then, after getting to the outermost layer, I multiplied by 3 again because the entire expression is 3 times that. \n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count how many times I have 1+3 inside. \n\nLooking at the original expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I see a \"1+3\", that's a layer. Let me count how many times 1+3 appears:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3)\n3. (1+3)\n4. (1+3)\n5. (1+3)\n6. (1+3)\n7. (1+3)\n8. (1+3)\n9. (1+3)\n10. (1+3)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the number of layers is 9. Because each time you have 1+3(...), and counting from the innermost, each layer is one more step. Let me recount:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) = 4\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Then, 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n11. Then, 1 + 3*(88573) = 265720\n12. Finally, 3*(265720) = 797160\n\nWait, so I have 12 steps, but actually, the innermost is step 1, and each layer adds one more step. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside the initial 3(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that after simplifying each layer, I should have 9 results before multiplying by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had 11 steps before the final multiplication by 3. Let me clarify this.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*(88573) = 265720\n12. 3*(265720) = 797160\n\nWait, so that's 12 steps, but the number of layers is 9. Because each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression. So, the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds one more. So, with 9 layers, the computation should be up to step 10, and then multiply by 3. But in my earlier counting, I went up to step 11 before multiplying by 3. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's see: the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... has 9 layers of 1+3. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that after simplifying each layer, I should have 9 results before multiplying by the outermost 3.\n\nBut when I computed, I had:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\n12. 3*265720 = 797160\n\nSo, that's 12 steps, but the number of layers is 9. So, perhaps the confusion is that each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost 3 is separate. So, the 9 layers would correspond to steps 1 through 9, resulting in 29524, and then step 10 would be multiplying by 3, giving 88572, but that doesn't align with my earlier computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 that's one layer, let's call it layer 1.\n\nBut actually, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, the structure is:\n\nLayer 9: (1+3)\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*(Layer 9)\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*(Layer 8)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 1: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1).\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, starting from Layer 9, which is (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier computation. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. If there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3, then the outermost 3 multiplies the result of Layer 1, which is 29524, giving 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier computation, I went up to 265720 before multiplying by 3 to get 797160. So, I think I made a mistake in counting the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, let's compute this correctly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the correct computation. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went beyond Layer 9, which was a mistake. I think I miscounted the number of layers because I was considering the outermost 3 as part of the layers, but actually, it's separate. So, the correct number of layers inside the outermost 3 is 9, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer should be 88572, not 797160 as I previously thought.\n\nLet me verify this again step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I must have miscounted earlier when I thought there were 11 layers. It's actually 9 layers inside the outermost 3, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3. By simplifying each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Substitute back into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue substituting each result into the next layer:\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me write down the expression to visualize it better. The outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). That something is another (1 + 3 times another something), and this repeats several times. I think I should count how many layers there are here. Let me see: starting from the innermost, there's (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...)) part. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)). \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3(1+3 is used. Hmm, from the innermost, I can see that each layer adds one more 3(1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. \n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to consider that each layer is a multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then moving outward, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. That sounds manageable. \n\nLet me try to map this out. Let's denote each layer as a step. Let's say step 1 is the innermost (1+3). Then step 2 is 1 + 3*(step 1), step 3 is 1 + 3*(step 2), and so on until step 9, since I think there are 9 layers here. Wait, let me check: the original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)), so maybe there are 9 layers. Hmm, perhaps I should count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)). Let me see: \n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time there's another 3(1+3(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), then the next layer is 3*(1+3), then 1 + 3*(that), and so on. Let me try to count how many times this happens. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a sequence of operations. Let me try to compute each layer starting from the innermost. Let me write down each step as I compute it. \n\nStarting with the innermost: Let's call this step 1: (1 + 3) = 4. \n\nThen, moving outward, step 2: 1 + 3*(step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. \n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. \n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. \n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. \n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. \n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. \n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. \n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing step 9 as 29524, that would be the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, the final result would be 3*29524. \n\nWait, but let me double-check how many steps I took. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent 3(1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them: \n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \n2. 3(1+3(...)) \n3. 3(1+3(...)) \n4. 3(1+3(...)) \n5. 3(1+3(...)) \n6. 3(1+3(...)) \n7. 3(1+3(...)) \n8. 3(1+3(...)) \n9. 3(1+3(...)) \n\nWait, but the innermost is just (1+3), without another 3(...). So, perhaps I have 8 layers after the initial one. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the original expression is: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3). Then, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, the number of layers is the number of times we have 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3(1+3( parts. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a 3(1+3, that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each 3(1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count the number of 3(1+3( instances. \n\nWait, in the original expression, after the initial 3(1+3, there are 8 more 3(1+3(, because each layer adds another 3(1+3( until we get to the innermost (1+3). So, that would mean there are 9 layers in total, including the innermost (1+3). \n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to step 9, getting 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. But maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers, leading to an incorrect result. \n\nLet me try to count the number of layers properly. The original expression is: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...)). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent 3(1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first 3(1+3( starts at the beginning.\n2. Then another 3(1+3( inside it.\n3. Then another 3(1+3(.\n4. Another one.\n5. Another.\n6. Another.\n7. Another.\n8. Another.\n9. Finally, the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total, each corresponding to a 3*(...) operation, starting from the innermost (1+3). So, each step from 1 to 9 would correspond to each layer. So, step 1 is (1+3)=4, step 2 is 1+3*4=13, step 3 is 1+3*13=40, step 4 is 1+3*40=121, step 5 is 1+3*121=364, step 6 is 1+3*364=1093, step 7 is 1+3*1093=3280, step 8 is 1+3*3280=9841, step 9 is 1+3*9841=29524. \n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(step 9) = 3*29524=88572. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by computing each step carefully.\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(step 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(step 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(step 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(step 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; so 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(step 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. \n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. I think I might have miscounted earlier because when I started, I thought there were 9 layers, but perhaps the initial 3*(...) is the outermost, and the innermost is step 1. Let me confirm the number of layers by looking at the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3( instances. Starting from the first 3(1+3(...), then each subsequent 3(1+3( is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)\n2. 3(1+3(...)\n3. 3(1+3(...)\n4. 3(1+3(...)\n5. 3(1+3(...)\n6. 3(1+3(...)\n7. 3(1+3(...)\n8. 3(1+3(...)\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of 3(1+3(...), but the innermost is (1+3), without another 3(1+3(...). So, that would mean that there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a step from 1 to 9. So, step 1 is (1+3)=4, step 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, and so on up to step 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(step 9)=88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check my calculation again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate a step.\n\nLet me try to compute each step again more carefully:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the calculations seem accurate. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each step is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of terms is small (9), computing each step manually is manageable.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each step sequentially, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13.\n\nAlright, moving another level out, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that, 3*13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40. So, now I have 40 at this level.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3 times the current result, which is 40. So, that's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and adding 1 gives me 121. That's a nice round number, 121. I wonder if this will continue in some pattern, but let's keep going.\n\nNext up, we have 1 + 3 times 121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. Hmm, okay, so that's 364. Moving on, the next expression is 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nContinuing, the next part is 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNext, we have 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that calculation because 3*9841 seems a bit high. Let me compute it again. 9841 times 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nMoving on, the next expression is 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me correct that. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me verify 3*29524. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 is 87000, and 524*3 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute that. 3*88573: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265720. So, that's 265720.\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me check 3*88573 again. Alternatively, 88573 * 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, adding up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to the next level, we have 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute that. 3*265720: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797161. So, that's 797161.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*797161. Let me compute that. 3*797161: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives me 2391484. So, that's 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify that. 797161 * 3: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 = 2391000, plus 300 = 2391300, plus 180 = 2391480, plus 3 = 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*2391484. Let me compute that. 3*2391484: 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 = 7170000, plus 3000 = 7173000, plus 1200 = 7174200, plus 240 = 7174440, plus 12 = 7174452. Then, adding 1 gives me 7174453. So, that's 7174453.\n\nWait, that seems really large. Let me check 3*2391484 again. 2391484 * 3: 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, adding up: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 = 7170000, plus 3000 = 7173000, plus 1200 = 7174200, plus 240 = 7174440, plus 12 = 7174452. Then, adding 1 gives 7174453. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression simplifies down to 7174453. But wait, the original problem was 3 multiplied by all those nested expressions. So, after computing all the layers, we have 3*(result). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. But in my calculations above, I started from the innermost and worked my way out, each time computing the next layer as 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the final result I got, 7174453, is the value inside the outermost parentheses, right? So, the entire expression is 3 times that. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, when I computed the innermost as 4, then the next layer was 13, then 40, and so on, each time moving outward. So, the outermost layer would be 1 + 3*(the result of the inner layers). Wait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, in my calculation above, I computed all the way up to the outermost parentheses, which was 7174453. But that was the result of the inner expression, right? So, the total expression is 3 multiplied by that. Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, let me parse the original expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the inner expression is (1 + 3*(...)), which I computed as 7174453. Therefore, the total expression is 3 * 7174453. So, I need to compute that.\n\nWait, so in my earlier steps, I was computing each layer as 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from the innermost. So, the last result I got was 7174453, which is the value of the innermost parentheses, right? Or was that the outermost? Wait, no, I think I went all the way to the outermost parentheses, so that 7174453 is the value of the entire inner expression, so the total expression is 3 times that. Therefore, I need to compute 3 * 7174453.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write down the structure:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Level 9)\n\nSo, I computed Level 1 to Level 9, each time getting the next level's value, and the final result is 3*(Level 9). Wait, but in my calculations above, I computed Level 1 as 4, Level 2 as 13, Level 3 as 40, Level 4 as 121, Level 5 as 364, Level 6 as 1093, Level 7 as 3280, Level 8 as 9841, Level 9 as 29524, Level 10 as 88573, Level 11 as 265720, Level 12 as 797161, Level 13 as 2391484, and Level 14 as 7174453.\n\nWait, that's 14 levels, but the original problem only has 9 nested parentheses. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to count the number of times \"1+\" appears after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+\", each subsequent \"1+\" is nested inside the previous. So, the number of \"1+\" is 9, right? Because after the initial 3, there are 9 \"1+\" terms, each with a corresponding set of parentheses. So, that would mean 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that.\n\nSo, in my earlier calculations, I went up to Level 9, which was 29524, but then continued beyond that, which might have been incorrect. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, I need to compute Layer 1 to Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nIn my earlier steps, I went beyond Layer 9, which was unnecessary. So, let me correct that.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went beyond Layer 9 and got 7174453, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so Layer 9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, the correct computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my earlier calculation where I thought I had 14 layers. That must have been a mistake because the problem only has 9 layers.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond Layer 9, which was a mistake. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+\", each subsequent \"1+\" is nested inside. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(...)\n\n3. 1+3(...)\n\n...\n\nEach time, a new \"1+\" is added. So, how many \"1+\" are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), that's the first.\n\n- Then, moving out, each \"1+\" adds another layer. So, the expression has 9 \"1+\" terms, meaning 9 layers.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"1+\" is at the first layer, then each subsequent \"1+\" is one more layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+\" terms after the initial 3. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n\n2. ... (1+3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach \"1+\" adds a new layer. So, from the expression, how many \"1+\" are there? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the first \"1+\" after the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+\" is inside the previous parentheses. Let me write them out:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) - first \"1+\"\n\n2. ... (1+3(...)) - second \"1+\"\n\n3. ... (1+3(...)) - third \"1+\"\n\n4. ... (1+3(...)) - fourth \"1+\"\n\n5. ... (1+3(...)) - fifth \"1+\"\n\n6. ... (1+3(...)) - sixth \"1+\"\n\n7. ... (1+3(...)) - seventh \"1+\"\n\n8. ... (1+3(...)) - eighth \"1+\"\n\n9. ... (1+3(...)) - ninth \"1+\"\n\nThen, the innermost is (1+3), which is the ninth layer. So, Layer 1 is (1+3), Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is 1+3*(Layer 8). Then, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation of 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by computing each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 7174453, but that was because I miscounted the layers and went beyond Layer 9. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step again.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've double-checked it using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, and both give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and applying the recurrence relation, we find that the expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, (1 + 3) is 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that innermost part plus 1. Wait, let me clarify: each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, if I start from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then, moving outward, the next level is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next level out is 13. Now, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. \n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm taking the result from the innermost expression, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then, the next one is 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Let me check that again: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yep, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. That's interesting, that's a square number, 11 squared. Maybe that's a coincidence, but it's good to note. \n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, so that's 364. Next level out is 1 + 3*(364). Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. \n\nWait, hold on, 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. Correct. \n\nMoving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. \n\nOkay, so that's 3280. Next level is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that: 3*3280. Well, 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. \n\nWait a second, 9841 is another square number. 99 squared is 9801, and 100 squared is 10000, so 9841 must be 99.5 squared or something? Wait, no, let me check: 99*99 is 9801, 100*100 is 10000. So, 9841 is actually 99.2 squared? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's 99. Let me compute 99 squared: 99*99. 100*100 is 10000, minus 100, minus 100, plus 1. So, 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801. So, 9841 isn't a perfect square. Maybe I was wrong about that. Hmm, maybe it's just a coincidence that some of these numbers are squares, like 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841. Wait, 4 is 2 squared, 121 is 11 squared, 9841 is... Let me check: 99 squared is 9801, 100 squared is 10000, so 9841 is between them. Let me try 99.2 squared: 99.2^2 = (99 + 0.2)^2 = 99^2 + 2*99*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 9801 + 39.6 + 0.04 = 9840.64. So, 9841 is approximately 99.2 squared. Not a whole number, so maybe it's not a perfect square. Maybe I was just thinking of the previous numbers. Anyway, moving on.\n\nSo, the next level is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. \n\nNow, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nWait, hold on, let me verify that multiplication again because that's a big number. 29524*3: \n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving to the next level, which is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let's break it down:\n\n80000*3 = 240000\n\n8000*3 = 24000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n70*3 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nWait, let me check the multiplication again because 88573*3:\n\n88573\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\n3* nothing, so just 2.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 88573 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut there are no more digits, so we write down the 2. So, the result is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. Hmm, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down earlier, I got 265719, which is the same as this digit-by-digit calculation. So, 265719 + 1 is 265720. Okay, so that's correct.\n\nNow, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 3*265720. Well, 200000*3 = 600000, 60000*3 = 180000, 5000*3 = 15000, 700*3 = 2100, 20*3 = 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 265720*3: \n\n265720\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n3*0 = 0\n\n3*2 = 6\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*6 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1.\n\n3*2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the result is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving to the next level, which is 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute that: 3*797161. Let me break it down:\n\n700000*3 = 2100000\n\n90000*3 = 270000\n\n7000*3 = 21000\n\n100*3 = 300\n\n60*3 = 180\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000\n\n2370000 + 21000 = 2391000\n\n2391000 + 300 = 2391300\n\n2391300 + 180 = 2391480\n\n2391480 + 3 = 2391483\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify the multiplication step by step:\n\n797161\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n3*1 = 3\n\n3*6 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n3*1 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*9 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\n3*7 = 21 + 2 = 23, write down 3, carry over 2.\n\n3* nothing, so write down 2.\n\nSo, the result is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(2391484). Let me compute that: 3*2391484. Let's break it down:\n\n2000000*3 = 6000000\n\n300000*3 = 900000\n\n90000*3 = 270000\n\n1000*3 = 3000\n\n400*3 = 1200\n\n80*3 = 240\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000\n\n6900000 + 270000 = 7170000\n\n7170000 + 3000 = 7173000\n\n7173000 + 1200 = 7174200\n\n7174200 + 240 = 7174440\n\n7174440 + 12 = 7174452\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 7174453.\n\nWait, let me check the multiplication again:\n\n2391484\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n3*4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*4 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n\n3*1 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3*9 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n3*3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n\n3*2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the result is 7174452. Then, adding 1 gives 7174453. Hmm, but wait, in my initial breakdown, I got 7174452, and adding 1 gives 7174453. But when I broke it down digit by digit, I think I might have made a mistake because 2391484*3: \n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n2391484\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n4*3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n\n1*3 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n3*3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the result is 7174452. Then, adding 1 gives 7174453. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving to the next level, which is 1 + 3*(7174453). Let me compute that: 3*7174453. Let me break it down:\n\n7000000*3 = 21000000\n\n100000*3 = 300000\n\n70000*3 = 210000\n\n4000*3 = 12000\n\n400*3 = 1200\n\n50*3 = 150\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nAdding those together: 21000000 + 300000 = 21300000\n\n21300000 + 210000 = 21510000\n\n21510000 + 12000 = 21522000\n\n21522000 + 1200 = 21523200\n\n21523200 + 150 = 21523350\n\n21523350 + 9 = 21523359\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 21523360.\n\nWait, let me verify the multiplication again:\n\n7174453\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n3*4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n3*7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2.\n\n3*4 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n\n3*1 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3* nothing, so write down 2.\n\nWait, that seems confusing.

Let me try again:\n\nWait, the number is 7,174,453.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n3*4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n3*4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n3*7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2.\n\n3*1 = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write down the 2.\n\nSo, the result is 21523359.

    "text": " \n\nLet me try to write this down more clearly so I can visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another 3 times that result. So, the next expression is 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12. Then, we add 1 to that, so 1 + 12 equals 13. Okay, so now that part simplifies to 13. \n\nLet me write this down step by step as I go outward. Maybe I can keep track of each level:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, let me check that. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so after the innermost part, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Level 10: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, the original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them to be sure. Each \"1+\" is followed by another parenthesis, so let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds another (1 + 3*(...)), and this repeats until we have nine layers. So, when I count, starting from the innermost as level 1, each subsequent layer is level 2, 3, up to level 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that level 9 result. So, maybe my initial count was off. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each parenthesis is one level. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3))\n\nSo, there are nine levels of parentheses, each with their own (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is level 9, then moving outward to level 8, etc., until we reach the outermost, which is level 1. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9, right? Because each time we add a new layer, it's a higher level.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the levels. Let me think of it as layers. The innermost is layer 1, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, so 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me confirm that I have nine layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the original expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have \"1 + 3(\" until we reach the outermost. So, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds a new layer:\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n   - (1 + 3(...\n\nSo, that's nine layers, right? So, layer 1 is the innermost, layer 9 is the outermost before the final 3 multiplier.\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I have to include each time the pattern repeats. So, if the innermost is layer 1, then each time we go outward, it's another layer. So, let me list them:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carried) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carried) = 8\n\nSo, reading from the top:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- Ten-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I should write it out more carefully.\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place):\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place):\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572.\n\nWait, but wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me verify this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding these up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to find the result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d7a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3\u00d7a_2 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29,524. Then, the total expression is 3\u00d7a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3\u00d7a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving the equation a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C\u00d73^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3\u00d7A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C\u00d73^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C\u00d73^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729,524 =88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 =3\u00d7(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=59,049\u00d73=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. Which is the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me check one more layer. Let's say layer 5:\n\na_5 should be 364.\n\nUsing the formula: a_5=(3^{6}-1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So, let's try that approach. \n\nStarting from the very inside, the innermost part of the expression is $(1+3)$. That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. That simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something here is the result we just got, which is 4. So, substituting that in, the next layer becomes $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that simplifies the next layer to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have another expression of the same form: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something here is the 13 we just calculated. So, substituting that in, it's $1 + 3(13)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is now 40. So, substituting, we get $1 + 3(40)$. Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 plus 120 is 121. So, that layer simplifies to 121.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, and the something is 121. So, substituting, it becomes $1 + 3(121)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 121 is 363, and 1 plus 363 is 364. So, that layer simplifies to 364.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 364. Substituting, we have $1 + 3(364)$. Calculating that: 3 times 364 is... let me think. 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 64 is 192, so 900 plus 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, that layer simplifies to 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with the something being 1093. Substituting, we get $1 + 3(1093)$. Calculating that: 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 93 is 279, so 3000 plus 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives us 3280. So, that layer simplifies to 3280.\n\nMoving another layer out, we have $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 3280. Substituting, the expression becomes $1 + 3(3280)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 3000 is 9000, and 3 times 280 is 840, so 9000 plus 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives us 9841. So, that layer simplifies to 9841.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with the something being 9841. Substituting, we get $1 + 3(9841)$. Calculating that: 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, that layer simplifies to 29524.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have another $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is 29524. Substituting, the expression becomes $1 + 3(29524)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573.\n\nSo, now we've simplified all the innermost parentheses outward, and the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses simplifies to 88573. But wait, the original problem has a 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, the entire original expression is 3 times 88573. Let me compute that: 3 times 80000 is 240000, 3 times 8000 is 24000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 70 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. \n\nWait a minute, let me check that multiplication again because that seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me compute 3 times 88573 directly. \n\nFirst, let's compute 88573 times 3:\n\n- 3 times 3 is 9, write down 9.\n- 3 times 7 is 21, write down 1 and carry over 2.\n- 3 times 5 is 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1.\n- 3 times 8 is 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, write down 5 and carry over 2.\n- 3 times 8 is 24, plus the carried 2 is 26, write down 6 and carry over 2.\n- Since there are no more digits, we just write down the carried 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 265,719. Wait, that's the same as before. So, 3 times 88,573 is indeed 265,719. \n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 88,573 times 3 step by step:\n\n88,573\nx      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 x 3 = 9\n3 x 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n3 x 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n3 x 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n3 x 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\nThere are no more digits, so write down the 2.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom, we have 265,719. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me add 88,573 three times to double-check:\n\n88,573 + 88,573 = 177,146\n\n177,146 + 88,573 = ?\n\nLet's compute 177,146 + 88,573:\n\n177,146\n+88,573\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n6 + 3 = 9\n4 + 7 = 11, write down 1, carry over 1\n1 + 5 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n7 + 8 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n7 + 8 = 15 + 1 (carry) = 16, write down 6, carry over 1\n1 + 0 = 1 + 1 (carry) = 2\n\nSo, adding them up:\n\n177,146\n+88,573\n= 265,719\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 times 88,573 is indeed 265,719. Therefore, the final result is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the entire process because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Maybe I can compute each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3(88573) = 265,719\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or see if there's a pattern that can be generalized to avoid computing each step manually. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on, up to a9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nSo, the sequence is defined recursively by a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing the final term without having to calculate each step manually.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C * 3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C * 3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C * 3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the term a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 is applied to a9.\n\nSo, let's compute a9:\n\na9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59,049. So, a9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got 88,573 as the value inside the outermost parentheses before multiplying by 3. However, according to this formula, a9 is 29,524, which is different.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake here because the step-by-step computation gave me 88,573, but the formula is giving me 29,524. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\". Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first inner is (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, and there are 9 such layers before the final closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, but when I computed step by step, I had 9 layers, each time computing from the innermost to the outermost, and ended up with 88,573 before multiplying by 3. So, in the formula, if n=9, then a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524, but that doesn't match the step-by-step result.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I misapplied it. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, if n=1, a1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches the first step.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which matches step 2.\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, which matches step 3.\n\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121, which matches step 4.\n\nn=5: a5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364, which matches step 5.\n\nn=6: a6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093, which matches step 6.\n\nn=7: a7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280, which matches step 7.\n\nn=8: a8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19,683 -1)/2 = 9,841, which matches step 8.\n\nn=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 29,524, which matches step 9.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step computation, after computing a9 as 29,524, I then added 1 and multiplied by 3, but that's incorrect. Wait, no, in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3 times (the entire nested expression). The nested expression itself is a9, which is 29,524. So, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572, but wait, that's not matching my earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, no, in the step-by-step, I had computed the innermost as 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then finally 88573. But according to the formula, a9 is 29,524, which is the value before multiplying by 3. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572, but in my step-by-step, I had 88,573. Hmm, that's a discrepancy of 1. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step computation again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a9 is 29,524, which matches the formula. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 88,573. So, where did that extra 1 come from? Let me check the last step again.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step, I had:\n\nAfter computing a9 as 29,524, I thought that was the value inside the outermost parentheses, so I multiplied by 3 to get 3*29,524 = 88,572. But in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 88,573. Let me recount.\n\nWait, no, in the step-by-step, I had 9 layers, each time computing a new a_i, ending at a9=29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step-by-step by miscalculating the final multiplication.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29,524 again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I had 88,573. So, perhaps I added an extra 1 somewhere. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step, after computing a9=29,524, I then added 1 and multiplied by 3, which would be incorrect. No, the formula says that a9=29,524 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, so the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 88,573, which is incorrect. So, the correct final answer should be 88,572, not 265,719. Wait, that's a big difference. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) =4\n2. 1 + 3*(4)=13\n3. 1 + 3*(13)=40\n4. 1 + 3*(40)=121\n5. 1 + 3*(121)=364\n6. 1 + 3*(364)=1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093)=3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280)=9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841)=29524\n10. 1 + 3*(29524)=88573\n\nWait, so actually, there are 10 layers, not 9. Because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer, and the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression, which is the 10th layer.\n\nWait, that's where I went wrong. I thought there were 9 layers, but actually, there are 10 layers because the outermost 3 is applied to the 10th term.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nEach \"1 + 3*\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3*, so the total number of layers is 9, because the outermost is 3*(...), which is layer 10.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me think differently. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each 1 +3*(...) is a new layer. So, the first layer is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1+3*4=13.\n\nThen, 1+3*13=40.\n\nThen, 1+3*40=121.\n\nThen, 1+3*121=364.\n\nThen, 1+3*364=1093.\n\nThen, 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nThen, 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nThen, 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, finally, the outermost expression is 3*(29524 +1)=3*(29525)=88,575.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is 1+3=4, and each layer adds another 1+3*.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 +3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 +3(\":\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3(...))\n3. (1 +3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nLet me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3(...))\n3. (1 +3(...))\n4. (1 +3(...))\n5. (1 +3(...))\n6. (1 +3(...))\n7. (1 +3(...))\n8. (1 +3(...))\n9. (1 +3(...))\n10. (1 +3(...))\n\nWait, but the outermost is 3*(1 +3(...)), so the total number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3, up to 9 layers, and then the outermost 3 multiplies the result of the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step, I ended up with 88,573, which is 3*(29524 +1)=3*29525=88,575, but that's not matching the formula.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n layers, where n=9 in this case, giving a9=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nBut in the step-by-step, I had 10 layers, computing up to a10=88,573, which is incorrect because the formula only accounts for 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how the layers are counted. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 +3*\" terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3(...))\n3. (1 +3(...))\n4. (1 +3(...))\n5. (1 +3(...))\n6. (1 +3(...))\n7. (1 +3(...))\n8. (1 +3(...))\n9. (1 +3(...))\n10. (1 +3(...))\n\nWait, no, the outermost is 3*(1 +3(...)), so the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*, so the total number of layers is 9, because the outermost is the 9th layer, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula uses n=9, giving a9=29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*a9=88,572.\n\nBut in the step-by-step, I had 10 layers, computing up to a10=88,573, which is wrong because the formula only requires 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to write out the expression with indices.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define b_k as the value of the expression starting from the k-th layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nb1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nb2 = 1 + 3*b1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nb3 = 1 + 3*b2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nb4 = 1 + 3*b3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nb5 = 1 + 3*b4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nb6 = 1 + 3*b5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nb7 = 1 + 3*b6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nb8 = 1 + 3*b7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nb9 = 1 + 3*b8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*b9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, from b1 to b9, and then multiplied by 3. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had computed 10 layers, which was incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 88,573, which is 88,572 +1. That suggests I added an extra 1 somewhere. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, in the step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. b1=4\n\n2. b2=13\n\n3. b3=40\n\n4. b4=121\n\n5. b5=364\n\n6. b6=1093\n\n7. b7=3280\n\n8. b8=9841\n\n9. b9=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*b9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 88,573, which must have been a miscalculation. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the formula. The formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59,049-1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*a9=88,572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 88,573, but that must have been a mistake. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers, thinking there were 10 instead of 9. Let me recount the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 +3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3(...))\n3. (1 +3(...))\n4. (1 +3(...))\n5. (1 +3(...))\n6. (1 +3(...))\n7. (1 +3(...))\n8. (1 +3(...))\n9. (1 +3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each with \"1 +3(\", and the outermost is 3*(...). So, the formula applies with n=9, giving a9=29,524, and then 3*a9=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which was incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the step-by-step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3) =4\n\n2. 1 +3*4=13\n\n3. 1 +3*13=40\n\n4. 1 +3*40=121\n\n5. 1 +3*121=364\n\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 88,573, but that must have been a miscalculation. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has 9 layers, and the formula correctly gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through the problem, I conclude that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because when I computed 3*29,524, I get 88,572, but when I did the step-by-step, I thought I had 88,573. Let me check 3*29,524 again.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let me write down the expression again to visualize it better. It's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by another similar expression). The innermost part is 1 + 3, so maybe I can start there and work my way out. Let me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Each \"1+\" starts a new set, and it looks like there are nine sets in total. Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then the next one is 1+3*(previous result), and this repeats until the outermost one. So perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. \n\nLet me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, until L9: 1 + 3*(L8), and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). That makes sense. So if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the value of each L and then combine them.\n\nLet me write down each step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now moving to L2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, L2 is 13. Now L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep going.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 121? That's 11 squared. Interesting, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nHmm, 364. Not sure if that's a square or anything, but let's continue.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n1093. Hmm, that's a prime number, I think. Let me check if I did the multiplication right. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Yeah, that's correct. So L6 is 1093.\n\nMoving on to L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3280. That's a nice round number, but I don't see a particular pattern yet. Let's proceed.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9841. Hmm, that's a large number. Let me verify the multiplication: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then adding 1 gives 9841. Correct.\n\nNow L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nWait, let me compute 3*9841 first. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nSo L9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So multiplying each part:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to slip up.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the right answer. To make sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nWait a second, this seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, in mathematical terms, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula, which could be used to compute a_9 directly without computing each step.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, the formula seems valid.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result for L9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the closed-form formula, I still get the same result, 88572. That gives me more confidence that this is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer, which is essentially the same recurrence.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to represent the expression as a sum of powers of 3, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems the most straightforward.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final value of 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue computing each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, compute the entire expression:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so now that part simplifies to 13. Let me keep track of each step as I move outward.\n\nSo the next level out is another 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so that becomes 40. Moving outward again, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 40.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait a second, that's 121. I'm noticing that each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. So maybe I can formalize this as a recursive process. Let's see.\n\nLet me define each level as a term in a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a\u2081 = 1 + 3, then a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, since I count nine sets of parentheses here. Let me check that.\n\nLooking back at the original expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is a\u2081. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous term). Since each opening parenthesis adds another layer, and I see nine opening parentheses after the initial 3, that means we have nine layers. So, starting from a\u2081 to a\u2089, each defined as a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nSo, let's compute each term step by step:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so a\u2089 is 29524. But in the original expression, the entire expression is 3 times (the innermost expression). So, after computing up to a\u2089, which is the innermost part, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3*(a\u2089). Because the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. So, after computing a\u2089 = 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the structure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 4, up to a\u2089, which would be the innermost part. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. So, if a\u2089 is 29524, then 3*a\u2089 is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but when I computed a\u2089, I thought it was the innermost part. Let me make sure. Each time, a\u2099 is the value of the nth layer, so a\u2089 would be the innermost, and then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's one layer, and each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, there are nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, a\u2081 is the innermost, a\u2082 is the next, up to a\u2089 being the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) is a separate layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 10 layers, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Alternatively, maybe it's 9 layers. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then each time you go out, you add another layer, so up to layer 9. So, a\u2081 = 4, a\u2082 = 13, a\u2083 = 40, a\u2084 = 121, a\u2085 = 364, a\u2086 = 1093, a\u2087 = 3280, a\u2088 = 9841, a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nWait, so a\u2089 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524*3: Let me compute it more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression would be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572. But let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Because if the expression is 3*(a\u2089), then that would be correct. But perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. So starting from the innermost, (1 + 3) is layer 1. Then each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving out, the next is (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 2.\n\n3. Next, layer 3.\n\nContinuing this way, each (1 + 3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count how many times (1 + 3( occurs after the initial 3.\n\nAfter the initial 3, the expression is:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the initial 3, we have 9 instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers, right? Because each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, a\u2081 is the innermost, a\u2082 is the next, up to a\u2089 being the outermost before the initial 3. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to a\u2089, I thought that was the innermost. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step without assigning a\u2099, just computing each nested expression one by one.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, we've reached the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(29524). Wait, but the original expression is 3 times this entire expression, right?\n\nWait, no. Let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, after computing all the layers up to the outermost (1 + 3*(...)) which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I computed up to the outermost (1 + 3*(...)) as 29524, which is the value inside the initial 3. So, the total expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed a\u2089, I thought that was the innermost, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me see. If I have nine layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 9 would be the outermost before the initial 3. So, the initial 3 is multiplied by layer 9's value, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me confirm each step once more to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit.\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers, let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions in the original problem.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, each step I computed corresponds to one layer, from 1 to 9. Therefore, the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the intermediate steps.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that innermost part with 4. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3(...)). Since the innermost is now 4, the next one becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that part simplifies to 13.\n\nWait, so the next level out from the innermost is now 13. Let me write that down. So, moving outward, each time I replace the innermost parentheses with its computed value.\n\nSo, step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next level: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next level: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next level: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next level: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next level: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next level: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next level: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I replace the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, each step, I compute the innermost parentheses, then move outward, multiplying by 3 each time.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, I thought there were nine sets of parentheses. Let me count: starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me check how many times I have to compute.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of (1+3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 opening parentheses, each followed by a closing one. So, that suggests there are nine levels of nesting. Therefore, I should compute each level from the innermost to the outermost, which would be nine steps, right? Let me see:\n\nWait, when I did my initial steps, I went up to 29524, which was step 9, and then the outermost is 3 times that. So, let me recount.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3 multiplied by this result: 3*29524.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So, after computing the innermost nine times, I get 29524, and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\n3*4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n3*2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3*5 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n3*9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n3*2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n--------\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the levels.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I have a (1+3(...)). So, the number of times I have to compute is 9, as each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the innermost is (1+3), which is 4, then each next is (1 + 3*previous), so 9 times in total.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 steps, from step 1 to step 9, each time computing (1 + 3*previous value). So, the 9th step gave me 29,524, and then the outermost 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Let me recompute each step carefully.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nWait, wait a second, in step 9, 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29,524) is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check step 6: 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, the expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D, so D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 levels, so n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier. Then, the outermost multiplication is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nWhich again, matches my previous result.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. I think I've done this correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series. The formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation is a more efficient way, but since the problem has only nine levels, it's manageable to compute step by step as well.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each nested expression step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each innermost parentheses is evaluated first, moving outward.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me write this down to visualize it better. The expression is: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nFirst level (innermost):\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, let me check that. The structure is 3(1 + ...). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next nested expression). So, each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think carefully.\n\nActually, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, starting from the innermost, it's like a recursive structure. Let me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a level. So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, there's a new (1 + 3(...)), so let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each step adds another (1 + 3(...))\n3. So, how many levels are there? Let me see: the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) with nine sets of parentheses. So, there are nine levels, each adding another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is level 9, and working our way out to level 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should number them from the inside out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is 3*(1 + ...). So, each level is 3*(1 + next level). So, Level 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, Level 2 is 3*(1 + Level 1). Wait, no, because Level 2 would be 3*(1 + Level 3). Wait, maybe I should number them from the inside as Level 1, then Level 2 is the next one out, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 1), so the total would be 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, starting from there, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check the multiplication for Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I should model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a function f(n), where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as n=1, and the outermost layer being n=9.\n\nThen, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems to follow a geometric progression.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is defined by f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a general formula for f(n).\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the final result using the formula:\n\nTotal = 3*f(9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nYes, because 3*3^{10} = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3.\n\nSo, Total = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer is growing exponentially because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a rapid increase. So, it's not surprising that the final result is a large number, 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so add the carry over 2.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully checking each step and even deriving a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by multiplying the next layer by 3 and adding 1. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me try to visualize this expression. It's a series of 3 multiplied by a sum of 1 and another 3 multiplied by a similar structure. Let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a 3 followed by a (, that's a new layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(previous), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Wait, no, let me count each individual opening parenthesis. Let me write it down:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))) Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... parts. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then another 3*(...), so that's 2\n3. Continuing, I count: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 25? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and work outwards, evaluating each layer one by one. That seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, let's approach this step by step. Let me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since I think there are 9 layers here. Let me confirm that. The innermost part is (1+3), which is Level 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 3*(...). So, let's define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) = 3*4 = 12, then Level 2 becomes (1 + 12) = 13\n\nWait, no, actually, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So perhaps I should define each level as:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9). So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake in counting the levels. Let me double-check how many levels there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Level 1. Then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...):\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3*(, there are 9 more opening parentheses. So that would mean 10 levels in total? Wait, no, because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the initial 3*( starts the first level, then each subsequent 3*( adds a new level. Let's count the number of 3*(...):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then another 3*(...)\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the base case, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(. Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(, there are 9 more opening parentheses: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, that's 9 more layers after the initial one. So in total, 10 layers? Wait, no. Because the initial 3*( is the first layer, and then each 3*( is another layer. Let me think differently. Let's consider that each time you have a 3*(1 + ...), it's a new layer. So starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then each time you go out, you add a new layer. So, in this case, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, then each time you wrap another 3*(1 + ...), that's the next layer. Let me count the number of 3*(...):\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(...), right? Because each time you have a 3*(1 + ...), that's a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent 3*(...) is a new layer, so 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I count the opening parentheses, I think it's 9 layers. Let me confirm by looking at the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(. The expression after the initial 3*( is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3*(, meaning 9 layers. So, in total, starting from the innermost, it's 9 layers. So, I should compute from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing, I went up to Level 9 as 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me calculate that.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that: 29,524 *3.\n\nYes, 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572.\n\nSo, the total expression would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I correctly evaluated each layer up to Layer 9. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)=1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLevel 4:1 +3*(Level 3)=1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLevel 5:1 +3*(Level 4)=1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLevel 6:1 +3*(Level5)=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLevel7:1 +3*(Level6)=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLevel8:1 +3*(Level7)=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLevel9:1 +3*(Level8)=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check Level9 again: 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Then 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I count the layers, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I evaluated, I only went up to Level9, which is correct because each layer corresponds to each 3*(...). So, 9 layers in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each level is defined by a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let me see: If I have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 =4, then L_2=1+3*4=13, L_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which matches what I did earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving it using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)}=A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10}=59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the initial step-by-step evaluation. Let me go through each Level again quickly:\n\nLevel1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel2:1+3*4=13\n\nLevel3:1+3*13=40\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=121\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=364\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. Alternatively, using the formula, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n1. **Level 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Level 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Level 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Level 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Level 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Level 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Level 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Level 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Level 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, I can replace that innermost part with 4. \n\n2. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). Since I just found that (1+3) is 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute 3*4 first because of the order of operations. 3*4 is 12, so now it's 1 + 12, which equals 13. \n\n3. Next layer out, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). The result from step 2 was 13, so this is (1 + 3*13). Again, I'll compute 3*13 first. 3*13 is 39, so now it's 1 + 39, which equals 40. \n\n4. Continuing outward, the next part is (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). The result from step 3 was 40, so this becomes (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, so adding 1 gives 121. \n\n5. Moving one layer further out, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). The result from step 4 was 121, so now it's (1 + 3*121). Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. \n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). The result from step 5 was 364. So, this is (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. \n\n7. Moving outward again, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). The result from step 6 was 1093. So, this is (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. I can break this down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. \n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). The result from step 7 was 3280. So, this becomes (1 + 3*3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. \n\n9. Going one layer further out, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). The result from step 8 was 9841. So, this is (1 + 3*9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. \n\n10. Next, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 9)). The result from step 9 was 29524. So, this becomes (1 + 3*29524). Calculating 3*29524: Let me do this step by step. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in that last multiplication. 3 times 29524. Maybe another way to compute it is 29524 * 3. Let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. \n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should just accept that 3*29524 is 88572, as I calculated earlier, and then adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nBut wait, let me check the previous steps to see if I made a mistake somewhere because 88573 seems quite large, and the problem only had nine sets of parentheses. Let me recount the steps:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1+3*4) = 13\n3. (1+3*13) = 40\n4. (1+3*40) = 121\n5. (1+3*121) = 364\n6. (1+3*364) = 1093\n7. (1+3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1+3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1+3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1+3*29524) = 88573\n\nWait, so there are 10 layers here because each opening parenthesis is being closed, starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. \n\nStarting from the inside:\n- The first innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...), so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nBreaking down the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each layer is (1 + 3*(previous result))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" represents a new layer. So, starting after the first 3, I have 9 instances of \"3(\", meaning there are 9 layers. So, from step 1 to step 10, I think I have 10 steps, but actually, the number of layers is 9. So, perhaps I miscounted the steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost, which is step 1, and then each layer out is another step. So, if there are 9 layers, that would mean 9 steps, right? But in my earlier calculation, I went up to step 10, which would be the 10th layer, but the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- After the first 3, the first layer is (1+3(...))\n- Each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, the number of \"3(\" is 9. So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is step 1, then each step out is another layer, so total steps would be 9. But in my earlier calculation, I had 10 steps, which might be the issue. Let me recount, making sure I have 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list the layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\nLayer 2: (1+3*4) = 13\nLayer 3: (1+3*13) = 40\nLayer 4: (1+3*40) = 121\nLayer 5: (1+3*121) = 364\nLayer 6: (1+3*364) = 1093\nLayer 7: (1+3*1093) = 3280\nLayer 8: (1+3*3280) = 9841\nLayer 9: (1+3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost to the outermost, the value is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, so that would be step 10: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. As I did earlier, 29524 * 3 is 88572. So, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, I thought there were 9 layers, but the calculation went up to step 10 because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the 9th layer result. So, perhaps my initial counting was correct, but I mislabeled the steps. Let me clarify:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3) = 4 (step 1)\n- Then, each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)), so step 2 is (1 + 3*4) = 13\n- Step 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n- Step 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n- Step 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n- Step 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n- Step 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n- Step 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n- Step 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n- Finally, the entire expression is 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)) and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the multiplications and additions check out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can write a small program or use a calculator to verify the final multiplication, but given that each step seems correct, I'm confident in this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step (Outermost Multiplication):**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3), right? So that would be the one at the very end before the first closing parenthesis. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that gives me 4. Now, moving one level out, I have another expression that's 1 plus 3 times the result of that innermost part. So let me compute that next.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nHmm, 3 times 4 is 12, so that becomes 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now I have 13. Let me move out another level. The next expression is again 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo now, I have 40. Let's keep going. The next one is 1 plus 3 times 40.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, 121. That seems familiar, like a square number, but maybe that's just a coincidence. Let's keep going.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nAlright, 364. Moving on, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times 364.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 is... let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo now, I have 1093. Next level out: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLet me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nAlright, 3280. Next level: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 9841. That seems like a big number, but let me check my multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3280 times 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Yep, that adds up to 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Okay, moving on.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.

Yep, adding those gives 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

Adding those up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484.\n\nAlright, 2391484. Now, moving out another level: 1 + 3*2391484.\n\nCalculating 3*2391484: Let's break it down. 2000000*3=6000000, 300000*3=900000, 90000*3=270000, 1000*3=3000, 400*3=1200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\" before the first closing parenthesis. So, starting from there, I can compute each layer one by one. Let me write down each step as I go, so I don't get lost.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, I can replace that innermost part with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I parse this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 multiplied by the next parentheses. So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after the innermost 1+3, the next step is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSo, 3*(4) is 12. Then, 1 + 12 equals 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40. \n\nNext layer out, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let's do that. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that simplifies to 121. \n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, that becomes 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that. 3*364 is... Hmm, 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer is 1093.\n\nNext, the expression is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate that. 3*1000 is 3000, and 3*93 is 279, so adding those together, 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that becomes 3280.\n\nMoving outward again, the next part is 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute that. 3*3000 is 9000, and 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, that layer is 9841.\n\nNext, we have 1 + 3*(9841). Calculating that, 3*9000 is 27,000, and 3*841 is 2523. So, 27,000 + 2523 is 29,523. Adding 1 gives 29,524. So, that becomes 29,524.\n\nMoving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*(29,524). Let's compute that. 3*20,000 is 60,000; 3*9,000 is 27,000; 3*524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,572 is 88,572. Then, adding 1 gives 88,573. So, that layer is 88,573.\n\nNow, the next part is 1 + 3*(88,573). Let me figure that out. 3*80,000 is 240,000; 3*8,000 is 24,000; 3*573 is 1,719. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000; 264,000 + 1,719 is 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives 265,720. So, that becomes 265,720.\n\nMoving outward, the expression is 1 + 3*(265,720). Let's compute that. 3*200,000 is 600,000; 3*60,000 is 180,000; 3*5,720 is 17,160. Adding them up: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000; 780,000 + 17,160 is 797,160. Then, adding 1 gives 797,161. So, that layer is 797,161.\n\nNow, the next part is 1 + 3*(797,161). Let me calculate that. 3*700,000 is 2,100,000; 3*90,000 is 270,000; 3*7,000 is 21,000; 3*161 is 483. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 is 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 483 is 2,391,483. Then, adding 1 gives 2,391,484. So, that becomes 2,391,484.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which we've now simplified to 3*(2,391,484). Let me compute that. 3 times 2,000,000 is 6,000,000; 3 times 391,484 is... Hmm, let me break that down. 391,484 * 3: 300,000*3=900,000; 90,000*3=270,000; 1,000*3=3,000; 400*3=1,200; 80*3=240; 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900,000 + 270,000 = 1,170,000; 1,170,000 + 3,000 = 1,173,000; 1,173,000 + 1,200 = 1,174,200; 1,174,200 + 240 = 1,174,440; 1,174,440 + 12 = 1,174,452. So, 3*391,484 is 1,174,452. Then, adding that to the earlier 6,000,000 gives 6,000,000 + 1,174,452 = 7,174,452. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. The outermost expression is 3*(2,391,484), right? So, that's 3 multiplied by 2,391,484. Let me double-check that calculation because I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the steps. Let me recast that. The last step was 3*(2,391,484). So, 2,391,484 multiplied by 3. Let's compute that properly.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n8 * 3 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n4 * 3 = 12, plus 2 is 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n1 * 3 = 3, plus 1 is 4, write down 4.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n3 * 3 = 9, plus 2 is 11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nSo, writing that out: 2,391,484 * 3 is 7,174,452. So, that seems correct. So, the final result is 7,174,452.\n\nWait a second, but I feel like that number might be too large. Let me check my previous steps to ensure I didn't make an error in the calculations. Let me go back through each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n3. Next: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n4. Next: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n5. Next: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n10. Next: 1+3*29524=1+88572=88573\n11. Next: 1+3*88573=1+265719=265720\n12. Next: 1+3*265720=1+797160=797161\n13. Next: 1+3*797161=1+2391483=2391484\n14. Finally: 3*2391484=7174452\n\nWait, so that's 14 layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after each 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that means I should have 9 layers. Wait, but in my calculation, I went up to 13 layers. That doesn't add up. So, I must have miscounted.\n\nWait, let me look again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is followed by a closing parenthesis, except the first one. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then it's closed.\n2. Then, moving out, each step adds another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the string: \"1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 1\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 2\n3. Continuing: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 3\n4. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 4\n5. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 5\n6. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 6\n7. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 7\n8. Then: 1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 8\n9. Finally: 1+3)))))) \u2192 9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, I should have 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost. So, my earlier count went up to 13, which was incorrect. I think I miscounted the layers when I was stepping through. Let me try again, this time keeping track of the layers correctly.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29,524. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20,000 = 60,000.\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000.\n\n3*500 = 1,500.\n\n3*24 = 72.\n\nAdding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier result. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I continued beyond 9 layers, which wasn't necessary because the original expression only has 9 layers of nesting. So, I mistakenly went beyond that, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation should stop at Layer 9, which is 29,524, and then multiply that by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because 3*29,524 should be 88,572.\n\nYes, because 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but when I was counting the number of 1+3(...) expressions, I found 9, but when I was stepping through the layers, I only went up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me write down each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was continuing beyond Layer 9, which was incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n is the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost layer being a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, we have:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier result. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me test that formula. For n=1, a_1=4. If I plug n=1 into (3^1 - 1)/2, I get (3 -1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. So, that formula doesn't fit here. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, I'll compute 3*29,524 again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through each layer, verifying my calculations, and even deriving a closed-form formula to confirm, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me try to write this out more clearly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, we add 1 to that, right? So, 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120; then 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363; then 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092; then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 3*(1093) = 3279; then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 3*(3280) = 9840; then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 3*(9841) = 29523; then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of steps, but let me check each one to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting from the very inside:\n\n1. The innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward.\n\n2. Moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13. Yep, that's correct.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40. Right.\n\n4. Then, (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121. That's correct.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364. Yes.\n\n6. Then, (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Moving on: (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's right.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Yes.\n\n9. Then, (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*(29524)) = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, in my initial calculation, I thought the outermost layer was 3*(29524) = 88572, but actually, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3*(result from the innermost). Wait, but in my step-by-step above, I think I made a mistake in the last step.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, each layer is 3*(something). So, when I get to the outermost layer, I have 3*(the result of the innermost expression). So, when I computed up to the 9th layer, I had 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524. So, the next layer out is 3*(29524) = 88572. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(88572). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me see: Each time we have a set of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more set of parentheses. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting after the first 3, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3(1+... So, starting from the first 3, then inside that is another 3(1+... and so on. Let me count the number of 3(1+... instances.\n\n1. The first 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost is (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds a 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 3*(Layer 2) = 39; then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 120; then 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*(Layer 4) = 363; then 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 1092; then 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3*(Layer 6) = 3279; then 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 9840; then 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 3*(Layer 8) = 29523; then 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 88572; then 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers of (1+3(...)) inside. So, perhaps I have nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, we would have the final result, and then multiply by 3 at the end? Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3*(something). So, the \"something\" is the result of the inner expression, which is 1 + 3*(...), and that's done nine times. So, perhaps I have nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). Wait, that might be the confusion.\n\nWait, let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I had 10 layers, but perhaps the outermost is just 3*(result), not 1 + 3*(result). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer up to 9 is 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost is 3*(result). So, total layers inside are 9, and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, that would make the total computation as follows:\n\nStart with innermost: 4\n\nThen layers 1 to 9: each time 1 + 3*(previous result), so:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(88573) = 265,719\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I computed up to Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then the outermost is 3*88573, which would be 265,719. But in my earlier step-by-step, I thought the outermost was 3*(29524) = 88572, which is different. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers of 1 + 3*(...) are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), then each subsequent (1+3(...)) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...) inside:\n\n1. The first (1+3(...)) after the initial 3 is layer 1.\n\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)) is layer 2.\n\n3. This continues until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), so that's layer 9, because each time we go in, we add a layer. So, the structure is:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3)\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that would mean that after 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), we get 29524, and then the outermost 3*(...) gives us 88572. But in my earlier step-by-step, I thought that after 9 layers, I had 88573, which would then be multiplied by 3 to get 265,719, but that seems too high. So, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to write down each layer with its corresponding step.\n\nLet me number the layers from inside out, starting at layer 1 as the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, after 9 layers, we get 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives us 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that after 9 layers, I had 88,573, which was a mistake because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct approach is that each layer from 1 to 9 is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, that gives us 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example to make sure the pattern holds. Suppose I have a simpler version with fewer layers, say, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, if I compute it step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, that's different. Wait, no, let me compute it correctly:\n\nWait, no, wait: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nBut according to my earlier method, with 3 layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40 = 120. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, so in this smaller example, with 3 layers inside, the result is 120, which is 3*40, where 40 is the result after 3 layers.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, after 9 layers, we get 29,524, and then 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought that after 9 layers, I had 88,573, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nLet me confirm this by computing it step by step again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I initially confused myself by miscounting the layers, but by breaking it down step by step and verifying with a smaller example, I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3). That's the one that's not followed by any more parentheses. So, let's compute that first. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part of the expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, I'll compute the multiplication: 3 times 4, which is 12. Then, add 1 to that result: 1 + 12 equals 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13. \n\nMoving one step further out, the next part is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, let's compute that: 1 + 3*13. First, 3 multiplied by 13 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives us 40. So, that level simplifies to 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next part is 1 + 3 times 40. Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we're at 121. \n\nNext up is 1 + 3 times 121. Hmm, 3 times 121... Let me do that multiplication. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives us 364. So, that simplifies to 364. \n\nMoving outward, the next part is 1 + 3 times 364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, that level becomes 1093. \n\nNext, we have 1 + 3 times 1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. So, that part simplifies to 3280. \n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. So, that level becomes 9841. \n\nNow, moving one step further out, the next part is 1 + 3 times 9841. Let me compute that. 3*9841... Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, that simplifies to 29524. \n\nNext, we have 1 + 3 times 29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. So, that part simplifies to 88573. \n\nMoving outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573. Hmm, 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives us 265720. So, that level becomes 265720. \n\nNow, we're almost at the outermost part. The next part is 1 + 3 times 265720. Let me compute 3*265720. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives us 797161. So, that simplifies to 797161. \n\nFinally, the outermost part of the expression is 3 times that result. So, we have 3*797161. Let me compute that. 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, and 3*1 is 3. Adding all those together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. \n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step simplifies the expression step by step until we reach the final result of 2,391,483. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do a lot of arithmetic, I might slip up. Let me go through each step again briefly. \n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. Then 1+3*13=40. Then 1+3*40=121. Then 1+3*121=364. Then 1+3*364=1093. Then 1+3*1093=3280. Then 1+3*3280=9841. Then 1+3*9841=29524. Then 1+3*29524=88573. Then 1+3*88573=265720. Then 1+3*265720=797161. Then finally, 3*797161=2391483. \n\nHmm, each step seems to follow correctly. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the last step where I just multiplied by 3. So, I think I did that correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. \n\nSuppose I define each term as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1. Then, each subsequent term is built by adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Let's see how many terms we have here. \n\nLooking at the original expression, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each step out adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+... So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: \n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer out adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count: \n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, then working outwards to the first layer. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times (1+3 occurs. Let me see: \n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: \n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. The innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th layer? Wait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3(1+3(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: \n\nStarting with 3(1+3(...)), then each subsequent (1+3(...) is another layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first layer is 3(1+3(...)), then inside that is another 3(1+3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1+3). \n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: \n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3). \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses. Wait, no. Let me count them: \n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3, each layer is a (1+3(...)). So, how many such layers are there? Let's see: \n\n- 3(1+3(...)) => 1 layer\n- Inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) => 2 layers\n- Continuing until the innermost (1+3) => 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, actually, starting from the first 3, the first layer is 3(1+3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3(1+3(...)), which is 9 times. Because the innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th layer. \n\nSo, if I model this as a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which is what I had before. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. \n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to a_8, because starting from a_0, each step increases n by 1. So, if there are 9 layers, that would correspond to a_9. Let me check: \n\na_0 = 1\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had a_9 as 29524, but in the overall expression, I went further out. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see: \n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of layers: \n\n- The first layer is 3(1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n- This continues until the innermost (1+3)\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. \n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2, then another ( at position 5, and so on. Let me count them: \n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first ( is at the start of the first inner expression: 1+3(\n   - Then each subsequent ( is another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after the initial 3, how many are there? Let me count:\n\n- After the first 3, the first ( is at the first inner layer.\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of ( after the first 3 is 8. Wait, let me see:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)). Inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1+3). \n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3(...) expressions. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first (1+3(...) is layer 1\n   - Inside that, another (1+3(...) is layer 2\n   - This continues until the innermost (1+3), which is layer 9\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 9 layers in total. So, starting from a_0 =1, a_1=4, up to a_9=29524. But in my earlier calculation, I went beyond that, up to 797161, which would be a_10. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression properly. \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n- 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3, each (1+3(...) is nested inside the previous one. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer out is (1+3*(...)), up to the outermost 3*(...). \n\nSo, how many times does (1+3 occur? Let's count the number of (1+3 in the expression:\n\n- The first (1+3 is at the start of the expression after the first 3.\n- Then, each subsequent (1+3 is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, let's count the number of (1+3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first (1+3 is layer 1\n   - Then, inside that, another (1+3 is layer 2\n   - Continuing until the innermost (1+3 is layer 9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, the recurrence relation would go up to a_9, which is 29524. But in my earlier step-by-step, I went beyond that, which suggests I might have miscounted. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when I compute the expression, starting from the innermost, each step corresponds to a layer. So, if there are 9 layers, I would compute from a_0 to a_9, and then multiply by 3 at the end. \n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the innermost expression. So, perhaps I need to compute a_9 first, then multiply by 3. \n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I started from the innermost (1+3)=4, which is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But that doesn't match my earlier total of 2,391,483. Hmm, I'm confused now. \n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the layers. Let me try to structure it properly. Let's define a_0 =1. Then, a_1 =1 + 3*a_0 =4, a_2=1+3*a_1=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=40, a_4=1+3*a_3=121, a_5=1+3*a_4=364, a_6=1+3*a_5=1093, a_7=1+3*a_6=3280, a_8=1+3*a_7=9841, a_9=1+3*a_8=29524. \n\nSo, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. But that's not matching my earlier step-by-step where I went up to 2,391,483. So, where did I go wrong? \n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of (1+3 in the expression. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of (1+3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first (1+3 is layer 1\n   - Then, inside that, another (1+3 is layer 2\n   - Continuing until the innermost (1+3 is layer 9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Therefore, the innermost is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. \n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond a_9, computing up to 797161 and then 2,391,483. That suggests I might have miscounted the number of layers. \n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again. The expression is: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3, each (1+3 is a layer. Let's count the number of (1+3:\n\n- The first (1+3 is at the start of the expression after the first 3.\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3.\n- This continues until the innermost (1+3.\n\nSo, how many (1+3 are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...)\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1+3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of (1+3:\n\n- The first (1+3 is at position 2.\n- Then, each subsequent (1+3 is inside the previous one.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 8 more (1+3 before reaching the innermost (1+3). Wait, no. Let me count the number of (1+3:\n\nBreaking down the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first (1+3 is at the start, then each subsequent (1+3 is nested inside. Let's count the number of (1+3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first (1+3 is layer 1\n   - Inside that, another (1+3 is layer 2\n   - This continues until the innermost (1+3 is layer 9\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. But earlier, I computed up to a_10=29524, but that seems inconsistent. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the indexing. Let me clarify:\n\nIf I define a_0 =1, then a_1=1+3*a_0=4, a_2=1+3*a_1=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=40, a_4=1+3*a_3=121, a_5=1+3*a_4=364, a_6=1+3*a_5=1093, a_7=1+3*a_6=3280, a_8=1+3*a_7=9841, a_9=1+3*a_8=29524. \n\nTherefore, the innermost layer is a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. \n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that, computing a_10=1+3*29524=88573, then 3*88573=265719, and so on, which suggests I had more layers. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. \n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first ( after the 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first ( is at position 2\n   - Then, each subsequent ( is at positions 5, 8, 11, etc.\n\nWait, let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( is after the initial 3, so that's 1.\n- Then, inside that, another (, so that's 2.\n- Continuing until the innermost (.\n\nSo, how many ( are there after the initial 3? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first ( is at position 2\n   - Then, another ( at position 5\n   - Another at position 8\n   - Another at position 11\n   - Another at position 14\n   - Another at position 17\n   - Another at position 20\n   - Another at position 23\n   - The innermost ( is at position 26\n\nWait, so that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Therefore, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Therefore, the innermost is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. \n\nBut in my initial calculation, I went beyond that, which suggests I might have miscounted the layers. Alternatively, perhaps the expression is structured differently. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers of (1+3(...)). Let me try to count again. \n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLet me define the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the 9th layer, then each layer out is another (1+3*(...)). Therefore, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, the innermost is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. \n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 2,391,483, which would correspond to a_11 or something. So, I think I must have miscounted the number of layers. \n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again. Let's count the number of (1+3 in the expression. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach (1+3 is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first (1+3 is layer 1\n   - Inside that, another (1+3 is layer 2\n   - This continues until the innermost (1+3 is layer 9\n\nSo, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the innermost is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. \n\nBut in my initial calculation, I went up to a_10=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719, and so on. So, I think I must have miscounted the layers. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the 9th layer, each layer out adds another (1+3*(...)). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, the innermost is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. \n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that, which suggests that perhaps I included the outermost 3 as a separate layer. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the outermost 3 is not part of the (1+3 layers, but rather multiplies the entire expression. \n\nWait, let me try to think of it differently. Let me define the innermost expression as a_1=1+3=4. Then, a_2=1+3*a_1=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=40, and so on, up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. \n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond a_9, which suggests I might have included the outermost 3 as part of the layers, which it's not. The outermost 3 is just multiplying the entire nested expression. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute up to a_9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result of 88572. \n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n10. 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that would be 10 steps, but the number of layers is 9. So, perhaps the confusion is that the outermost multiplication by 3 is step 10, which is separate from the 9 layers. Therefore, the final result is 88572. \n\nBut earlier, I continued beyond that, which suggests I miscounted. Let me see where I went wrong. \n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I started with (1+3)=4, then 1+3*4=13, and so on, up to 797161, then multiplied by 3 to get 2,391,483. That suggests I had 10 layers of (1+3(...)), which would be a_10=797161, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. \n\nBut according to the expression, there are only 9 layers of (1+3(...)), so a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. \n\nSo, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of (1+3 in the expression again. \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3 after the initial 3, each subsequent (1+3 is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first (1+3 is layer 1\n   - Inside that, another (1+3 is layer 2\n   - This continues until the innermost (1+3 is layer 9\n\nSo, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the innermost is a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. \n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step calculation was incorrect because I continued beyond a_9, which is not necessary. The correct final result should be 88572. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. \n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. \n\nWait, but I'm confused because in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that, which suggests I might have miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression again. \n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))"

It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3))))))))). So, there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 plus 3 times another set. Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me number them from the inside out to keep track.\n\nLet's denote each inner expression as follows:\n\nLet me define E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, the next one out would be E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nThen E3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire problem is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(something).

Compute E3 = 1 + 3*E2\n4. Compute E4 = 1 + 3*E3\n5. Compute E5 = 1 + 3*E4\n6. Compute E6 = 1 + 3*E5\n7. Compute E7 = 1 + 3*E6\n8. Compute E8 = 1 + 3*E7\n9. Compute E9 = 1 + 3*E8\n10. Finally, compute 3*E9.\n\nThat seems like a solid plan. Let's go through each step one by one.\n\nStarting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, E1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to E2: E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, E2 = 13.\n\nNext, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, E3 = 40.\n\nMoving to E4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Therefore, E4 = 121.\n\nNow, E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, E5 = 364.\n\nNext up, E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, E6 = 1093.\n\nMoving on to E7: E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, E7 = 3280.\n\nNext, E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, E8 = 9841.\n\nNow, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, E9 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 13\n\nE3 = 40\n\nE4 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE6 = 1093\n\nE7 = 3280\n\nE8 = 9841\n\nE9 = 29524\n\nFinal result = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because these numbers are growing quite rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Since each step is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution or recognize a pattern.\n\nLet me write down the recurrence:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2*C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: E9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nAlternatively, since E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*E_n = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*E9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nThis confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is 177147. Then, subtract 3: 177147 -3 =177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps thoroughly, checked each computation, and even found a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, revealing a pattern that follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we find that each term can be expressed as \\( E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me try to write this out step by step. I think the best approach is to start from the innermost part of the expression and work my way outwards. So, the innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3): That's straightforward, 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next part is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*4): First, I do the multiplication: 3 times 4 is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, this part simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). Let's compute that.\n\n3. Compute (1 + 3*13): Again, do the multiplication first: 3 times 13 is 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. So, this simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 3)).\n\n4. Compute (1 + 3*40): Multiplication first: 3 times 40 is 120. Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121. So, this part is 121.\n\nNext level out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 4)).\n\n5. Compute (1 + 3*121): Multiplying first: 3 times 121 is 363. Add 1: 1 + 363 = 364. So, this simplifies to 364.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 5)).\n\n6. Compute (1 + 3*364): Multiplying first: 3 times 364 is 1,092. Add 1: 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. So, this part is 1,093.\n\nContinuing to the next level, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 6)).\n\n7. Compute (1 + 3*1,093): Let's do the multiplication: 3 times 1,093. Hmm, 3 times 1,000 is 3,000, and 3 times 93 is 279. So, 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then add 1: 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. So, this simplifies to 3,280.\n\nNext, moving out another level, the expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 7)).\n\n8. Compute (1 + 3*3,280): Let's calculate 3 times 3,280. 3 times 3,000 is 9,000, and 3 times 280 is 840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then add 1: 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. So, this part is 9,841.\n\nMoving outward again, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 8)).\n\n9. Compute (1 + 3*9,841): First, 3 times 9,841. Let's break this down: 3 times 9,000 is 27,000; 3 times 800 is 2,400; 3 times 40 is 120; and 3 times 1 is 3. Adding all these together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then add 1: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, this simplifies to 29,524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3 times the result from step 9.\n\n10. Compute 3 * 29,524: Let's calculate this. 3 times 29,000 is 87,000; 3 times 524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29,524 times 3: 4 times 3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1; 2 times 3 is 6 plus 1 is 7; 5 times 3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1; 9 times 3 is 27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2; 2 times 3 is 6 plus 2 is 8. So, 29,524 times 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, except for the very last step where we just multiplied by 3. Each step built upon the previous one, and by carefully computing each level, I arrived at the final result.\n\nI think I did each step correctly, but just to be thorough, let me verify a couple of the intermediate steps to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLooking back at step 3: (1 + 3*13). 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct.\n\nStep 5: (1 + 3*364). 3 times 364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: (1 + 3*3,280). 3 times 3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: (1 + 3*9,841). 3 times 9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nAnd the final step, 3 times 29,524 is 88,572. Correct.\n\nOkay, so all the steps check out. I think I did this correctly. It was a bit tedious with all those nested parentheses, but by breaking it down step by step, it became manageable. Each time, I just focused on the innermost part, simplified it, and then used that result in the next level out. It was like peeling an onion, layer by layer. So, the key was to not get overwhelmed by the entire expression but to tackle it piece by piece.\n\nI wonder if there's a formula or a pattern here that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). So, it's a recursive-like structure where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Maybe there's a way to represent this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to represent this expression in terms of a variable. Let's say the innermost expression is x. Then, each subsequent expression would be 1 + 3x, and the next one would be 1 + 3(1 + 3x), and so on. So, if I let x be the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next one is 1 + 3x = 1 + 12 = 13, which is what I had before. So, each step is 1 + 3 times the previous step.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can express this as a sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. Let me denote a_n as the nth term starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121, and so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I might be able to compute it without calculating each step. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 29,524\n\nHmm, let me see if I can find a pattern here. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for a_9, which is the term we need, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good verification.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which is the same as I found before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula was a more efficient way, but since I had to compute it step by step initially, it helped me understand the pattern and then I could use the formula to verify my answer.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I could have saved time, especially if the expression had more layers. But even without that, breaking it down step by step worked well.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3 times the next step plus 1. It's like each layer is building up the number exponentially because of the multiplication by 3 each time.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how nested operations can quickly lead to large numbers, but by methodically working through each layer, even a complex-looking problem becomes manageable.\n\nI think I'm confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer. I double-checked using two different methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation with a formula. Both gave me the same result, so I feel pretty sure it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step outward, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 times 4 is 12. Got it. So, replacing the innermost part, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)))))))$\n\nWait, let me check that. The innermost part was (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4), which is 1 + 12, right? So, 1 + 12 is 13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me correct that.\n\nStarting again, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer is 3*(13) = 39. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, perhaps I should go step by step, each time replacing the innermost parentheses and computing outward.\n\nLet me structure this as layers. Let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine opening parentheses, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count each \"1 + 3(...)\" as a layer.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the original expression: starting from the left, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time it's a 1 plus 3 times another term. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Let me see: the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how deep it goes. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that each time we have a new layer, we can compute the value step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try this approach:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression only has eight layers after the initial 3, right? Let me check again. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. (1 + 3*(1093)) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. (1 + 3*(3280)) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. (1 + 3*(9841)) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, I think there are only eight layers after the initial 3. Let me check the structure again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost. Let's count the number of such layers:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer if we count from the inside out, but actually, when we start computing from the inside, it's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression has nine layers in total because each time you go in, you add another layer. Let me try to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. That's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13. Layer 2.\n\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40. Layer 3.\n\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121. Layer 4.\n\n5.

Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check if I'm counting correctly. Alternatively, maybe the expression is only 8 layers deep. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, after the first 3, there are eight layers of (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3*(...\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of such layers:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does \"1 + 3*(...\" occur? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, counting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like 9 layers. Let me check the original expression again to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times this occurs:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's see how many times we do this.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3*(, there are eight instances of 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\n- 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer if we count from the inside out, but perhaps the outermost is the first layer. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this recursively or find a pattern. Let me try to see if there's a formula for such expressions.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can be solved using the formula for a geometric series or recognizing it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, we have (1 + 3) as layer 1, then each time we go out, we add another layer, so up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs, it's 8 times, right? Because after the initial 3*(, there are 8 instances of \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\n- The first is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs, which is 8 times after the initial 3*(.\n\nWait, perhaps that's where I went wrong earlier. So, if there are 8 layers, then L_8 would be the value inside the outermost 3*(.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf I have 3*(L_8), where L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7.\n\nSo, let me compute up to L_8.\n\nGiven that, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*L_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. So, I think I miscounted the number of layers earlier. If the original expression has 8 layers after the initial 3*(, then L_8 is 9841, and the total expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by looking at the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another layer:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), where the inner part is 1 + 3*(...). So, if the inner part is Layer 9, then the entire expression is 3*Layer_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut now I'm confused because depending on how I count the layers, I get different results. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me think of the expression as a tree. The outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is (1 + 3*(...)). That inner part is another layer, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let's count the number of layers correctly. Let me parse the expression from the inside out.\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. That's Layer 2.\n\nNext layer out is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 3.\n\nContinuing:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, the original expression only has eight layers after the initial 3*(. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial 3*( is considered a layer or not. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs after the initial 3*(.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3*(, there are eight instances of \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nWait, no, let me count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 first \"1 + 3(\"\n\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1 + 3*(...)\" \u2192 second\n\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many \"1 + 3(\" are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n- The first is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3*(, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nThen, inside that:\n\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nContinuing until:\n\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nAnd then the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, that's 8 layers after the initial 3*(, meaning that the innermost is Layer 8, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8).\n\nWait, but earlier I had Layer 9 as the innermost. I think I'm getting confused because I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let me write down the expression step by step, replacing each innermost layer with its value.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving outward, the next layer is:\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer_1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*Layer_2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer_8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, if I have 8 layers after the initial 3*(, then the value is 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I counted up to Layer 9, I got 88572, which seems too high. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(.\n\nEach \"1 + 3*(...\" adds another opening parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\n- 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 first opening parenthesis after 3*\n\nThen, each subsequent \"1 + 3*(...\" adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses are there after the initial 3*(?\n\nLet me see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 1\n\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 2\n\n3. And so on, until:\n\n8. The eighth opening parenthesis.\n\nThen, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the ninth parenthesis.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the last one. So, the number of opening parentheses after 3* is 8, meaning that there are 8 layers after the initial 3*(, so the innermost is Layer 8, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer_8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, which would make the total expression 3*29524 = 88572. But that seems inconsistent with the structure.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the initial 3*( is considered a layer or not. Let me try to think of it as the outermost operation being 3*(...), where the inner part is a sum of 1 and 3 times another similar expression. So, each time, we have a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), where the inner part is 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 9. So, that would make the entire expression 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the number of layers after 3*( was 8, which would make Layer_8 the innermost, but now I'm seeing that perhaps it's 9 layers in total.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me use a different approach: write down the expression with indices.\n\nLet me denote E_n as the expression starting from the nth layer.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that the expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, how many a_n terms are there? Let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers after the initial 3*(.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3*( is part of the layers or not. Let me try to see: the expression is 3*(a_8), where a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7, and so on down to a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, if a_8 is the innermost, then the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut when I computed a_9, that would be the next layer, which isn't present in the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has eight layers after the initial 3*(, meaning that the innermost is a_8 = 9841, so the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting results based on how I count the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nLet me write down the original expression step by step, replacing each innermost layer:\n\nStart with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, replace that with 4:\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times do I perform this replacement? Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and the inner part has eight layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps Layer 9 is the innermost, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances after the initial 3*(, I get eight, which would correspond to Layer 8 being the innermost, making the entire expression 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the initial 3*( is considered a layer or not. Let me try to approach this methodically.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me consider the expression as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers.\n\nSo, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3*(...\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n- Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = f(1) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = f(2) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = f(3) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = f(4) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = f(5) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = f(6) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = f(7) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = f(8) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = f(9) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the number of layers after the initial 3*( was 8, leading to f(8) = 9841, and the total being 3*9841 = 29523. But now, considering that the entire expression is 3*f(9), which is 88572, that must be the correct answer.\n\nI think the confusion was in how I counted the layers. The original expression has nine layers in total because each \"1 + 3*(...\" adds a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, f(9) is the innermost, and the entire expression is 3*f(9).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is "

Each set starts with a 1 and then adds 3 times another set. Let me try to count them to be sure. Starting from the left, the first set is 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent set is also 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats. \n\n1. The innermost part is 1 + 3.\n2. Then moving out, it's 1 + 3(1 + 3).\n3. Next, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n4. Continuing this way, each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, maybe I should number them to make it clearer. Let me assign each layer a number from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nBut wait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it seems like there are eight more sets, making it nine layers in total. Let me check:\n\nStarting with the first 3, then:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3).\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(previous expression)).\n3. So each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nSince each layer is nested inside the previous one, I need to compute starting from the innermost. So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote Layer n as the nth innermost expression. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 2 is the next one out, and so on.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression has nine layers? Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n7. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n8. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n9. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct, with each layer building on the previous one.\n\nSo, computing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is the outermost expression, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, it's 3 times the outermost Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the Layer 9 calculation. Let me double-check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but let me think again if I interpreted the original expression correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364. Correct.\n\nYes, so each Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. The recurrence is of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the common ratio and c is a constant.\n\nIn this case, r=3 and c=1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation to find a formula for Layer n.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nBut wait, E is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147.\n\nSo, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9. We compute this as follows:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each set has 1 plus 3 times the next set. So, perhaps I can start by evaluating the innermost one and then work my way outwards. That seems like a good strategy because each step will build on the previous one, and I won't get lost in the complexity.\n\nLet me label each set of parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. I'll call the innermost one as level 1, the next one as level 2, and so on, up to level 9, which is the outermost. So, starting with level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, level 1 equals 4. \n\nNow, moving up to level 2: 1 + 3*(level 1). Since level 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, level 2 equals 13.\n\nNext, level 3: 1 + 3*(level 2). Level 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, level 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to level 4: 1 + 3*(level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives me 121. Therefore, level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(level 4). Level 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1, I get 364. So, level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(level 5). Level 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives me 1093. Therefore, level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(level 6). Level 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me calculate that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives me 3280. Therefore, level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(level 7). Level 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives me 9841. Therefore, level 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(level 8). Level 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives me 29524. Therefore, level 9 is 29524.\n\nNow that I've computed each level from 1 to 9, the outermost part of the expression is 3*(level 9). Since level 9 is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. I'll go through each level again quickly.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me multiply each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNo more digits, but we have a carry over of 0, so we're done.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, which is what I had before. So that seems correct. Hmm, maybe I was confused when I tried to do it again, but it's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. That seems like a lot, but considering the number of nested operations, it might be correct. Let me just check if I can see a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each level step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). This looks like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each level manually.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's write the equation for n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe also need another condition to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence relation:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nUsing the closed-form formula for n=2:\n\na_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9\n\nSo, A = 9 / 6 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n\n9/2 + B = 4\n\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2 = -0.5.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that, it's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I have computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, I can use this formula to find a_9 without computing each level step by step.\n\nCalculating a_9: (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049/2 is 29524.5. Then, subtracting 1/2 gives me 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 is indeed 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found earlier.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 another way. Let me break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000,\n\n3*9000 = 27000,\n\n3*500 = 1500,\n\n3*20 = 60,\n\n3*4 = 12.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000,\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500,\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560,\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after computing each level step by step, verifying each computation, and even deriving a closed-form formula to confirm the result, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level from the innermost to the outermost as \\( a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_9 \\). Each level is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost expression:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Each one is 1 plus 3 times the next one. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. \n\nLet me try to parse this. Let's denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then multiply that result by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. But inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is another similar expression. So maybe there are actually nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3 at the end. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, I see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 1 + 3*(...), and each time, it's nested within another. Let me count how many times 1 + 3*(... occurs. Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each time going outward, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers is that? Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n2. Then moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2.\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is Layer 3.\n4.

Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, I need to compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9.

Let me go through each layer again step by step to confirm.\n\nStarting with L_1:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 \u00d7 3: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 \u00d7 3: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280 \u00d7 3: 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841 \u00d7 3: Let's compute 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2*A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one step by step, but using the formula is more elegant and less error-prone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. \n\nUsing the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThe final value is computed as:\n\n$3 \\times \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{3^{11} - 3}{2} = 88,572$\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that doesn't match my earlier step. I think I might have confused the order earlier. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically. Let me count the number of nested parentheses first to know how many steps I need to take. Let me see: starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of parentheses, each opening with (1 + 3(...)). So, each time, we have a new level. Let me list them from the innermost as level 1 to the outermost as level 9.\n\nSo, level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses, which is 3*(level 9). So, after computing level 9, I need to multiply by 3 again.\n\nSo, the total result would be 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, but let me check each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each level one by one again.\n\nStarting with level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1 + level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let me compute 1336*3: 1336*3 is 4008. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(level 9), which is 3*36084. Let me compute that: 36000*3=108000, 84*3=252, so 108000+252=108252.\n\nWait a second, that seems correct, but let me verify each multiplication step again to be absolutely sure.\n\nStarting with level 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 3*(1+4)=3*5=15. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 3*(1+15)=3*16=48. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 3*(1+48)=3*49=147. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 3*(1+147)=3*148=444. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 3*(1+444)=3*445=1335. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 3*(1+1335)=3*1336=4008. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*(1+4008)=3*4009=12027. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*(1+12027)=3*12028=36084. Correct.\n\nFinal step: 3*36084=108252. Correct.\n\nHmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested parentheses. So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the result of the nested expression up to level 9. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of levels. The original expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a level. Let me count them: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Yes, nine levels. So, the calculation up to level 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous_level). So, each level is built upon the previous one. So, starting from level 1: 4, then level 2: 3*(1+4)=15, level 3: 3*(1+15)=48, and so on until level 9:36084. Then, the total expression is 3*36084=108252.\n\nYes, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, given the repetitive structure. Let me think about that.\n\nEach level can be represented as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can expand this:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this recurrence relation more formally. The recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3*1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*(1 + a_p). Solving for a_p:\n\na_p = 3 + 3*a_p\na_p - 3*a_p = 3\n-2*a_p = 3\na_p = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this: 11/6 *3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = [11*3^{n-1} - 3]/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = [11*3^{0} - 3]/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = [11*3^{1} - 3]/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 =15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = [11*9 - 3]/2 = (99 -3)/2=96/2=48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9,\n\na_9 = [11*3^{8} -3]/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = [11*6561 -3]/2 = (72171 -3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*36084=108252.\n\nSo, the final result is 108252.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the formula. Let me compute 11*6561:\n\nCompute 10*6561=65610, plus 1*6561=6561, so total is 65610+6561=72171. Then subtract 3: 72171-3=72168. Divide by 2: 72168/2=36084. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*36084: 36084*3.\n\nCompute 36000*3=108000, 84*3=252, so total is 108000+252=108252. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 108252.\n\nJust to recap, the approach was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each level step by step, verifying each multiplication.\n3. Optionally, model the problem using a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to confirm the result.\n4. Finally, compute the outermost multiplication by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThis systematic approach helped me avoid mistakes and ensured that each step was correct before moving on to the next. It's a good strategy when dealing with nested expressions or recursive-like structures.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the result of the next level. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each level's result is used in the computation of the next. After computing up to the ninth level, the final result is obtained by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Compute Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. **Compute Each Subsequent Level:**\n   - Level 2: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4) = 15\n   - Level 3: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 15) = 48\n   - Level 4: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 48) = 147\n   - Level 5: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 147) = 444\n   - Level 6: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Level 7: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Level 8: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Level 9: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Expression:**\n   - Final Result: 3 \u00d7 36084 = 108252\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{108252}$"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the very last \"1+3\". That seems like a good starting point. Let me write that down. So, innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 equals 4. Okay, so I can replace that innermost part with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I parse this correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 multiplied by the next parentheses. So, it's like a chain: 1 + 3*(next part). So, starting from the inside, each step involves computing the innermost parentheses first, then moving outward.\n\nLet me try to visualize this as a series of steps. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting with the innermost one as step 1, then moving outward to step 2, step 3, and so on, until I reach the outermost expression. That way, I can compute each step one by one without getting confused.\n\nSo, step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That's 4. Then, step 2: The next parentheses out is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Since step 1 gave me 4, this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, step 2 result is 13.\n\nMoving on to step 3: The next parentheses out is again 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, step 3 result is 40.\n\nStep 4: Next, it's 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40. That's 1 + 120, which equals 121. So, step 4 result is 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(step 4 result). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, step 5 result is 364.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(step 5 result). That's 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, step 6 result is 1093.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(step 6 result). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, step 7 result is 3280.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(step 7 result). That's 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, step 8 result is 9841.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(step 8 result). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, step 9 result is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, hold on. Let me check that calculation again because 3*9841 seems a bit large. Let me verify:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, step 9 result is indeed 29524.\n\nNow, moving to step 10: The outermost parentheses, which is 3*(result from step 9). Wait, no, hold on. Let me look back at the original problem to make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, when I started, I considered each innermost parentheses as a step, but actually, each step after the first one is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, right? So, perhaps I miscounted the number of steps. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis after the first 3( is another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. From the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3(, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" instances. So, that means there are 9 layers in total. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the expression is built as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, total layers are 9, with each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my initial steps were correct, going from layer1 to layer9, and then multiplying the final result by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to step 9, which was 29524, and then I thought step 10 would be 3*(step9). But looking back, the original expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is the result after 9 layers. So, perhaps I was correct in my initial approach, computing up to layer9, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I stopped at layer9 as 29524, and then I thought step10 would be 3*29524, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, no, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) So, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire inner expression, which is 1+3*(...). So, after computing the innermost layers up to layer9, which is 29524, that is the value inside the outermost parentheses, so the entire expression is 3*29524. So, that would be step10: 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to step9 as 29524, which is the result inside the outermost parentheses, so then the final step is to multiply that by 3, which is step10: 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial breakdown, I thought of each layer as step1 to step9, and then the final step would be multiplying by 3. So, perhaps I should compute that final step now.\n\nSo, step10: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had step9 as 29524, which is the result inside the outermost parentheses, so the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and a \"(\", so each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1+3*(...)\n3. Each time, it's another 1+3*(...)\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another \"(\", so let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- After the first 3(, we have 1+3(\n- Then, inside that, another 1+3(\n- This continues until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then inside, another 1+3(\n3. Another 1+3(\n4. Another 1+3(\n5. Another 1+3(\n6. Another 1+3(\n7. Another 1+3(\n8. Another 1+3(\n9. Another 1+3(\n10. Then, the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, that seems like 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3( layer1 )\n\nWhere layer1 is 1+3( layer2 )\n\nlayer2 is 1+3( layer3 )\n\n...\n\nlayer9 is 1+3( layer10 )\n\nWait, but no, because the innermost is 1+3, which doesn't have another layer. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, with each layer being 1+3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost as layer1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or perhaps find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer step by step. Since a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, the expression is built like this: starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times that result plus 1. It's almost like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think I need to evaluate the innermost one first and then work my way out, each time substituting the result back into the next layer. Let me try to write down each step systematically to keep track.\n\nLet me start by labeling each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. That way, I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n...  \nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So perhaps each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). Hmm, that might complicate things a bit because the innermost layer is Layer 1, but the expression is built from the inside out, so maybe I should start from Layer 1 and compute each subsequent layer outward.\n\nLet me try to write each layer as I go:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, so Layer 2 would be 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break that down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n- 3 (the next digit) is actually the first digit, so 2*3=6, but wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0  \n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________\nMultiply each digit from right to left:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0  \n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1  \n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly evaluated each layer. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers earlier on.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So each layer's value is as I calculated.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So when I compute Layer 9, that's the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1, and finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that would give 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer can be expressed recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. If I have a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit tricky because the recursion goes the other way. Normally, we have a recurrence relation where a_{n+1} depends on a_n, but here, a_n depends on a_{n+1}, which is the next term. So perhaps I can write this as a_9 = 4, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on up to a_1.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I started from a_1 = 4, then computed a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9. But in reality, a_1 is the innermost layer, so when I compute a_2, it's 1 + 3*a_1, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to express each a_n in terms of a_1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\na_1 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 1 + 3 + 9*a_1 = 4 + 9*4 = 4 + 36 = 40  \nWait, that doesn't seem right because 3*(1 + 3*a_1) is 3 + 9*a_1, then adding 1 gives 4 + 9*a_1.\n\nWait, so a_3 = 4 + 9*a_1  \nSimilarly, a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(4 + 9*a_1) = 1 + 12 + 27*a_1 = 13 + 27*a_1  \nWait, but a_2 was 13, so a_4 = a_2 + 27*a_1.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern here where each a_n can be expressed as a sum involving powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's try to see:\n\na_1 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 1 + 3 + 9*a_1 = 4 + 9*a_1  \na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(4 + 9*a_1) = 1 + 12 + 27*a_1 = 13 + 27*a_1  \na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*(13 + 27*a_1) = 1 + 39 + 81*a_1 = 40 + 81*a_1  \na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*(40 + 81*a_1) = 1 + 120 + 243*a_1 = 121 + 243*a_1  \na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*(121 + 243*a_1) = 1 + 363 + 729*a_1 = 364 + 729*a_1  \na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*(364 + 729*a_1) = 1 + 1092 + 2187*a_1 = 1093 + 2187*a_1  \na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*(1093 + 2187*a_1) = 1 + 3279 + 6561*a_1 = 3280 + 6561*a_1  \n\nWait, but we know that a_9 = 4, from the innermost layer. So, substituting a_1 = 4 into a_9:\n\na_9 = 3280 + 6561*a_1  \nBut a_9 = 4, so:\n\n4 = 3280 + 6561*4  \nCompute 6561*4:  \n6000*4=24000  \n500*4=2000  \n60*4=240  \n1*4=4  \nSo 24000 + 2000 = 26000, +240=26240, +4=26244  \nThen 3280 + 26244 = 29524  \nBut a_9 should be 4, but according to this, it's 29524. That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is flawed. Let me think again. Maybe I shouldn't be expressing a_9 in terms of a_1, but rather, since a_9 is the innermost term, it's just 4, and then each a_n is built from that.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40  \na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121  \na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364  \na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093  \na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280  \na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841  \na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524  \n\nYes, that's correct because each a_n is built from the previous one, starting from a_1. So a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to express a_9 in terms of a_1, I ended up with a_9 = 3280 + 6561*a_1, which when a_1=4, gives 3280 + 26244 = 29524, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but why did I think it was a problem earlier? Maybe I confused myself for a moment, but it's okay now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no mistake in the number of layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, so let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, so the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nEach layer adds a term that's 3^n times the innermost term. Wait, let's try to express the total expression as a sum.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)  \nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9  \nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27  \nAnd so on, each time adding 3^n where n increases by 1 each layer.\n\nWait, so after n layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nBut in this case, we have nine layers, so the innermost is 3^1, then each layer adds another power of 3. Wait, but in our case, we have nine layers, but each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which might not exactly be a geometric series, but perhaps it's similar.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's denote S as the entire expression. So S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers inside. But maybe I can express this recursively.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as S = 3*(1 + S'), where S' is the expression with one fewer layer. But maybe that's overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can model each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., as I did earlier. So the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try that. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1  \nSo, K - 3*K = 1  \n-2K = 1  \nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly for each layer.\n\nTherefore, the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I can directly compute a_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, that's a more efficient way without having to compute each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable, and it's a good way to verify the formula.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1=3  \n3^2=9  \n3^3=27  \n3^4=81  \n3^5=243  \n3^6=729  \n3^7=2187  \n3^8=6561  \n3^9=19683  \n3^{10}=59049  \n\nYes, so 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I went through each layer step by step, then found a formula to confirm the result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the innermost part, which is the last set of parentheses: 1+3. Then, each layer wraps around that with another 1 plus 3 times the result. So, it's like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think there are nine layers to compute. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, and then work my way out. That should simplify the problem step by step.\n\nLet me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer, I can find the value of each subsequent layer until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply that by 3 to get the final result. That seems manageable.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so it's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 times 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's see:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3), and working my way outwards. Maybe I can compute each level one by one.\n\nLet me start by labeling each level for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3(Level 9). So, if I compute each level step by step, I can build up the solution.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Level 2, which is 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, then:\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot that. Level 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3 * 13\n\nLet me compute 3 * 13 first, which is 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nMoving on to Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3 * 40\n\n3 * 40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3 * 121\n\n3 * 121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364.\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3 * 364\n\n3 * 364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3 * 1093\n\n3 * 1093: Let me compute that. 1000 * 3 is 3000, 93 * 3 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3 * 3280\n\n3 * 3280: 3000 * 3 is 9000, 280 * 3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3 * 9841\n\n3 * 9841: Let me break this down. 9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, 1 * 3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3 * 9841 = 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3(Level 9) = 3 * 29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nHmm, but let me check another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute Level 9 again. Level 9 is 1 + 3*Level 8, and Level 8 is 9841.\n\nSo, 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nSince there are no more digits, write down the 2.\n\nWait, that would give 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nYes, so 3*9841 is 29523, then 29523 +1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each level from the innermost parentheses outward.
