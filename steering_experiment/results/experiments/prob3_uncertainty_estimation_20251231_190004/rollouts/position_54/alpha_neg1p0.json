    "text": " So putting it together: 87, 75, 72? Wait, maybe I should write it down step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

But wait, let me check if I correctly computed each layer. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3(...)) and each time it's nested. Let me count the number of times '1 + 3(' appears. \n\nLooking at the original expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost: \n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, there's another 1 + 3*(...), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of '1 + 3(' in the expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1+3(' is a new layer, so starting from the first '1+3(' after the initial 3, each subsequent '1+3(' adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times '1+3' appears as a separate term. Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each '1+3(' is a new layer, and the innermost is just 1+3, so the total number of layers is 9. So, Layer 1: 1+3, Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). So, 9 layers in total. Therefore, my computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer9 being 29524, and then the entire expression being 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of this expression to see if my method is correct. Let's take a smaller version, say, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) and compute it manually, then see if my method gives the same result.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost first: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nNow, let's compute it step by step:\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, compute the entire expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should give the correct result.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe problem is: Compute \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\).\n\nWe break it down step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n... and so on up to a_9.\n\nI can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me try that approach as a third method to verify.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have 1 + 3*(something). If we denote the innermost something as x, then each layer is 1 + 3x. But since each layer is nested, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\nWait, but the formula I derived earlier already accounts for that, so perhaps it's not necessary, but let's see.\n\nIf I think of the entire expression as starting from the innermost part and working out, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a repeated operation.\n\nBut since I've already confirmed the result using the recurrence relation, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, without using the formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, same result each time. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the outermost layer is computed as 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.

Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, which could be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it's similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, let's see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), but in this case, our initial term is a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, comparing to the standard form, c=3 and d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as starting from a_0. Let me try that. Suppose a_0 = 1 (the innermost 1), then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1. Then, the solution to this recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, correct. n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. Great, so the formula works. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, but actually, in the problem, the innermost is a_1, but our formula starts at a_0. Wait, no, let's see: The original problem has 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), so from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers. So, if I consider the innermost as a_1, then the outermost would be a_9. But according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 87572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Wait, 3^{11} is indeed 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 is (177144)/2 = 88572. But earlier, when I computed 3*29524, I got 87572. There's a discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my steps again. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of parentheses in the original problem. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. Starting from the first 3, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. From the expression, after the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\n- The first layer after the initial 3 is (1+3(...))\n- Then another layer inside that, and so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times (1+3 appears. From the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3 is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...)\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1+3), so the number of layers is 9. Because each (1+3(...) adds a layer, and the innermost is just (1+3). So, from the initial 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Therefore, in the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. But when I tried using the formula as 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572, which is different. So, where is the mistake? Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see. The formula I derived was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where a_n corresponds to n layers starting from a_0=1. So, if I have 9 layers, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=87572. Alternatively, using the formula for 3*a_9: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, but 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572, which is different from 87572. That suggests that either my initial computation was wrong, or my formula is misapplied. Let me check the initial computation again, layer by layer, to see if I made an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=87572.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, there's a discrepancy of 88572 - 87572=1000. That's a big difference. So, I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the initial computation. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me parse the expression more carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Each time, a new (1 + 3 is added, and each one corresponds to a layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each adding another (1 + 3(...)). So, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=87572. So, why does the formula give me 88572? Let me check the formula again. The formula was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, which is correct. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. Alternatively, if I consider the formula for 3*a_n, it's 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. So, for n=9, that would be (3^{11}-3)/2=177147-3=177144/2=88572. But that contradicts the direct computation. Therefore, I must have misapplied the formula. Wait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is for the nth term starting from a_0=1, but in our problem, the outermost term is 3*a_9, which is different from a_{10}. Because a_{10} would be 1 + 3*a_9=1 + 3*29524=88573, which is not what we're computing. We're computing 3*a_9, which is 87572, not a_{10}. So, the formula for a_n is correct, but we're not computing a_{10}, we're computing 3*a_9. Therefore, the correct value is 87572, not 88572. So, my initial computation was correct, and the formula was misapplied because I confused 3*a_9 with a_{10}. Therefore, the correct final answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 87572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{87572}"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Let's denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Wait, but in this case, S is equal to 3*(1 + S'), where S' is another similar expression with one fewer layer. But actually, since there are 9 layers, maybe it's better to stick with the previous approach. However, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can compute a_9 as above. So, I think I've confirmed it in multiple ways: step by step computation, recurrence relation, and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1=4: L_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly used the formula for L_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 - 3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. Yep, same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 90000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might save time if I have to compute a similar expression with more layers. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me try to express it in terms of a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is computed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_n, where n is the number of layers. In this problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(...)\". I see that after the initial 3(, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)). So, n = 9 layers. So, the value inside is a_9, and then the total is 3*a_9. Now, solving for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but a_1 is defined as 4. Wait, actually, in our problem, a_1 is 4, which is the first layer. But in the recurrence, a_n is defined in terms of a_{n-1}, so let's check if n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4. Yes. So, for n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad. I think I've got it. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the innermost value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2.

But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising.

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is 1+3(...). Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nLooking at the original expression, I think there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are nine closing parentheses after the initial 3(...). So, that would mean there are nine layers inside, which would make the outermost layer a_9, as I computed before.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I went up to Layer 9, which is correct because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer using the formula. Let's say n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. By solving the recurrence relation, we find that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for solving a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - r*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation k - r =0, so k=r. Then, the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = c + r*A => A - r*A = c => A(1 - r) = c => A = c/(1 - r).\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = B*r^n + c/(1 - r).\n\nIn our case, c=1 and r=3. So, the particular solution is 1/(1 - 3)= -1/2. The homogeneous solution is B*3^n.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = B*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = B*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3B - 1/2 => 3B = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => B = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me plug n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for a geometric series, each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let me see.\n\nThe expression can be seen as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so it's a bit more complex. The formula I used earlier is probably the most straightforward way to approach it.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and applying the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and check each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let's find the homogeneous solution first: The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula instead of computing each layer manually, but since the number of layers isn't too large (only 9), it's manageable either way.

Let me make sure that I didn't skip any layers or miscount.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each (1+3(...)) adds another layer. Let me count how many times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...)) is a new layer.

And so on until layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3).\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So the total number of layers is 9, each corresponding to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nSo, I think my earlier computation is correct, with each layer up to layer 9 being 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the initial count is correct. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3.

Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3) terms. From the innermost, there are 9 instances where (1+3) is used before closing a parenthesis. So that would mean 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier computation up to layer 9 is correct.\n\nSo, layer 1: 4\n\nlayer 2: 13\n\nlayer 3: 40\n\nlayer 4: 121\n\nlayer 5: 364\n\nlayer 6: 1,093\n\nlayer 7: 3,280\n\nlayer 8: 9,841\n\nlayer 9: 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I added correctly for each layer. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct up to layer 9. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a geometric progression here.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's substitute L_n into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. So, L_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested and repetitive structure. The recurrence relation approach solidifies the result, showing that each layer follows a predictable pattern based on powers of 3. This not only helps in computing the value for layer 9 but also provides a general formula for any number of layers, which could be useful if the problem were extended further.\n</think>\n\nThe given problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but wait, the original expression is 3*(...). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's a quicker way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in calculation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. Let's add those together: 87000 + 1500 = 88500, then +72 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more complex. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer being a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I consider the innermost term as 1, then each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, for each layer, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the inside, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, it's 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3 times that is 88572. But let me double-check the layers step by step because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me see: If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for a_n without computing each term step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the equation: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Then, Layer 2 is a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which also matches. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. That makes me confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that should be the final answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nThe structure of the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, we can model this as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for f(n). Let's see.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in our case. The solution to this kind of recurrence is given by:\n\nf(n) = a^(n) * C + (b)/(a - 1)\n\nWhere C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me verify that. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*a^n. The particular solution is a constant, say f_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a).\n\nWait, in our case, a = 3, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*f(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form solution, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's pretty thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula, we find the result to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. We know that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. However, for larger numbers of layers, the formula would be much more efficient.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which also matches. So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, using the formula is a good way to cross-verify.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me verify my steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, for each layer, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the outermost layer before multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to do it step by step. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, no carry.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Write down 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)\n9 (thousands place)\n5 (hundreds place)\n2 (tens place)\n4 (units place)\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carry.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, no carry.\n\nSo writing it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add:\n\n59048\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, no carry.\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, total is 88572. Yep, that matches. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because if that's wrong, everything else will be off. So let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times... ))). So when I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p = 1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for n=9, a_9 =29524, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series or something. Let me think. The expression inside is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify one more time. Alternatively, I can compute each layer numerically again: Layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each nested layer step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Finally, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. Because 3 * 4 is 12, carry over 1. 3 * 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 3 * 5 is 15, carry over 1. 3 * 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 3 * 9 is 27, carry over 2. 3 * 2 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 3 * 0 (since there are no more digits) is 0, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after 2, there's nothing, so 3*0 is 0, but we have the carry-over 2, which makes it 2. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is the number, so it's 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, let me see. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me recall that for a finite geometric series, the sum S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1) = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). But in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So maybe I can model it recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and using the closed-form formula is a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, although it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. It's good to cross-verify using a different method to ensure accuracy. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.

Wait, let me verify that. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. 2 * 3 = 6, write 6. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers I actually had. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and that continues until the innermost 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out one layer, we add another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3(1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Wait, because from the innermost 1+3, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.

    "text": " 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should do it step by step without breaking it into parts. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 9*3=27, carryover 2, write 7. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 3*3=9, write 9. So the result is 88572. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me verify using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined recursively. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} -1)/(b-1). Wait, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n = C*b^n, and the particular solution would be a constant if a is a constant. Alternatively, for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution can be found by iterating the recurrence. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Starting with L_1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, this seems similar to powers of 3. Let me see: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Wait, but L_1=4, which is 3 +1. L_2=13, which is 12 +1, and 12 is 3*4. L_3=40, which is 39 +1, 39=3*13. Hmm, so each L_n is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's compute L_n for n=1 to 9:\n\nn: 1, L_n:4\nn:2, L_n:13\nn:3, L_n:40\nn:4, L_n:121\nn:5, L_n:364\nn:6, L_n:1093\nn:7, L_n:3280\nn:8, L_n:9841\nn:9, L_n:29524\n\nWait, I notice that each L_n seems to be (3^{n} -1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but L_1=4. That doesn't match. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches L_2=13. For n=3: (81-1)/2=40, which matches L_3=40. For n=4: (243-1)/2=121, which matches L_4=121. For n=5: (729-1)/2=364, which matches L_5=364. For n=6: (2187-1)/2=1093, which matches L_6=1093. For n=7: (6561-1)/2=3280, which matches L_7=3280. For n=8: (19683-1)/2=9841, which matches L_8=9841. For n=9: (59049-1)/2=29524, which matches L_9=29524. Wow, that's a neat pattern. So, the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Since 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_n, where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern, I arrived at the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check each layer computation because I might have made a mistake in one of those steps.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 +9=3,279. Then 1 + 3,279=3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So 9,000 + 600 + 240=9,840. Then 1 + 9,840=9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400=29,400; 29,400 + 120=29,520; 29,520 + 3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29,524=88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad.\n\nWait, another thought: This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it as such. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a pattern using recurrence relations, and confirmed that both methods give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer's value is calculated step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I computed each layer correctly because if any of those layers were wrong, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Okay, so that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would solve L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something, but since I already have the value, I think that's sufficient.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because if any of those were wrong, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer checks out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each subsequent layer's value. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me verify that step because that's where the error might have occurred.\n\nLayer 8 was 9841, right? So Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carryover 2\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carryover 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number: 9,8,4,1.\n\nWait, actually, 9841 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carryover 2\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carryover 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 would go in front, making it 29523.\n\nWait, that's 29523, not 29524. Wait, no, let me do it properly.\n\nWait, 9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carryover 2\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carryover 2\n\nSo, putting it together, it's 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I think I made a mistake because when I did 9841 \u00d7 3, I thought it was 29523, then added 1 to get 29524. So that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous layers. Let's go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the answer without having to manually compute each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I already computed each layer step by step and verified that it's correct, and the formula also gives the same result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. After computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general solution, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
