    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it out properly:\n\n    29524\n  x    3\n  --------\n    88572\n\nWait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + D => 4 = 3C + D. To find another equation, let's compute a_2. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging into the general solution: 13 = C*3^2 + D => 13 = 9C + D. Now, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3C + D = 4\n\n2) 9C + D = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9C + D) - (3C + D) = 13 - 4 => 6C = 9 => C = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug C back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + D = 4 => 9/2 + D = 4 => D = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

But let me double-check the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error. Let me recompute Layer 9 and the final multiplication.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + (3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n3*800 = 2400\n3*40 = 120\n3*1 = 3\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, 3*29524: Let's compute this carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula that could simplify this computation instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d73 =60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d73 =88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3:3\u00d729524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous term). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 =1 +3=4\n\na_2=1 +3*a1=1 +12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n=3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C =3*C +1 \u2192 C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21924=3A -1/2 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as before.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly.\n\nThis confirms that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step.

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me explore that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or some recursive formula. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the computation is correct as I did it. But let me just make sure that I didn't count the layers wrong. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1+3(...), so that's the first layer. Each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n11. )))\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Each time I see a (1+3( it's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, in total, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, my computation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, computing each layer up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 at the end is the right approach.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try computing the layers again, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to verify the result without computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works for all layers. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula, which confirms the result.\n\nSo, I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

So, putting it together: 87572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Hmm, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a recursive relation. So, we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number that's following the pattern a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to see it without computing each layer step by step. But either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I should compute the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let me do that quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Yes. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, no mistakes there. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_k. The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_k - 3a_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_k^{(h)} = C*3^{k}. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_k^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When k=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula for each layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the recurrence relation approach is correctly applied here. The expression is indeed a linear recurrence, so using the formula should give the correct result without having to compute each layer step by step. It's a good way to verify the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to represent this expression. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, perhaps the sum can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nBut in this case, since each term depends on the previous one, it's more of a recursive sequence rather than a simple geometric series. So, the recurrence relation approach seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds a term that's 3^n, but I might be mixing things up. Let me see.\n\nWait, from the recurrence solution, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps by expanding all the parentheses, but that seems messy. Alternatively, I can think of it as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try that. Let me see if I can represent the expression as a sum.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, maybe it's similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some term.\n\nWait, let me think about the expansion.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I look at the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps E can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested.\n\nWait, but from the earlier approach, we saw that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, that's another way to write it. Let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to get the answer, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, recurrence relation, and direct formula. All lead to the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe start by defining each layer as a recursive sequence. Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the expression at each layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. The recurrence relation is:\n\n\\[\na_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n\\]\n\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\nSolving the recurrence relation, we find:\n\n\\[\na_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( n = 9 \\):\n\n\\[\na_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n\\]\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\):\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me add 29524 + 29524 first. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to get there without computing each layer step by step. It's a bit more advanced, but it confirms the result. So, whether I compute each layer manually, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I end up with the same final answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should just compute it as 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any calculation errors in each step. Each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer. So, it's a geometric progression, maybe? Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've got it right. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation.

So, each layer is built correctly. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9, which we found to be 29524.\n\nAlternatively, this recursive formula can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say K. Plugging into the equation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let me do it more carefully:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, units digit 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 = 28.

Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me think about expanding it. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then an additional 1 is added. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, since I've already found the recurrence relation and solved it, maybe that's the most straightforward way.\n\nIn any case, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1 \\) to \\( L_9 \\). Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)), with n layers. In this case, n=9. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a closed-form solution.\n\nLet me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nLooking at the recursion, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nWe have L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}\n\nAssume L_k = A*3^{k} + B\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{k} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^{k} + B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{k} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with k=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for k=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors when using the formula. Let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049, and subtracting 1 gives 59048, which divided by 2 is 29524. So, L_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, then multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because if I made a mistake in any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong.

Wait, but let me think again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of parentheses to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach additional layer adds another set. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\nThen, each layer wraps around that with another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLet me write the expression again and count:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first opening parenthesis after the first 3, each subsequent parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ... (1+3(...\n3. ... (1+3(...\n4. ... (1+3(...\n5. ... (1+3(...\n6. ... (1+3(...\n7. ... (1+3(...\n8. ... (1+3(...\n9. ... (1+3))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers? Or 8? Let me see. Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the innermost is just 1+3 without another parenthesis. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 around it. So, the total number of layers is 9 because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost is Layer 1, so up to Layer 9. Therefore, I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly, which gives 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as such.\n\nEach term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nIf I unroll the expression, starting from the innermost layer:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nContinuing this pattern, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}\n\nWait, that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0=1 up to 3^{n}.\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which unrolls to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nBut actually, when I computed a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, which is a geometric series.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014the iterative step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524.

So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, leading to the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: Each time, I have 1 + 3*(...). The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and each of those has another (1+3(...)) inside. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. The first inner (1+3(1+3(...))\n3. Then another inner (1+3(1+3(...))\n...\nUp to how many? Let me count the number of (1+3 sections. Each time, the expression is 1+3 followed by another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that. So, from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers inside the first 3. So, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make an error in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check with a calculator. Alternatively, I can recognize that this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also used a different method (recurrence relation) to confirm that Layer 9 is 29524, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent when using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, it's 3^{10} -1 over 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, yes, 88572. Alternatively, to compute 29524 * 3, I can do 30000 *3 = 90000, then subtract (30000 - 29524)=476, so 476*3=1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for it, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward and less error-prone. But just to explore, maybe there's a pattern or a formula here. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... Up to L_9, and then the total is 3*L_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This seems similar to a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. So, L_9=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to see if I made any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Subtract 476 \u00d7 3 because 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3). 476 \u00d7 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.

So, let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again because 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that again: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 using another method. 29524*3 is the same as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3. So:\n\n20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a formula for it, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward and less error-prone. However, for future reference, if there were more layers, maybe a formula would be better. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I'm only dealing with a small number of terms, it's probably easier to compute each layer as I did before.\n\nBut for the sake of understanding, let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, L_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the closed-form is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That might be useful if the expression had more layers, but in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work fine.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify the closed-form formula for n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which is correct as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, if I were to write a general solution for such a nested expression with k layers, it would be 3*( (3^{k+1} -1)/2 ). In this case, k=9, so 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= 3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just continued computing each layer step by step as I did initially, which also led me to the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize that each layer can be computed step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. Compute each layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next one.\n\n3. Once all layers are computed up to the ninth, multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n4. Double-check the computations using a different method (in this case, a closed-form formula) to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think that covers everything. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the layers because each step built on the previous one, and each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 was straightforward. It's just a matter of carefully computing each layer without rushing. So, yeah, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. Finally, the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Assuming a particular solution is a constant C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are all positive integers, so maybe this approach isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the recurrence as a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Let me check: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => a_n + 1/2 = 1 + 1/2 + 3*a_{n-1} = 3/2 + 3*a_{n-1}. Hmm, not quite 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2), because 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3/2, which is different from a_n + 1/2 = 3*a_{n-1} + 3/2. Wait, actually, that's the same. So, a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Therefore, if we let b_n = a_n + 1/2, then b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. That's a simple geometric progression with ratio 3. So, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. We know that a_1 = 4, so b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4.5 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For Layer 1, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2, n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3, n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4, n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5, n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6, n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7, n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8, n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost expression, which is Layer 9, is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524. As before, 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. If the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, then the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and we look for a particular solution. Let\u2019s assume the particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same number. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can find the solution efficiently. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we determine that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This can be represented recursively.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula:** Define each layer \\( a_n \\) as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Closed-Form Solution:** Solve the recurrence relation to find \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer:** For the 9th layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29,524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\), so \\( 3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524: Let's compute 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carryover 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carryover 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, adding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me make sure that was correct.\n\nWait, let's go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, because I count nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I did the initial layers, I thought maybe I miscounted. Let me check each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each time, the innermost is (1 + 3). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen each time it's wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3(...) occur? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer, and there are nine such layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But I'm wondering if that's correct because 88572 seems a bit large, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. The general form is Layer n = a*Layer n-1 + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is Layer n = a^n * Layer0 + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1), where Layer0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so maybe Layer0 would be 1? Wait, no, because Layer1 is 1 + 3*1 = 4. So, perhaps the general formula is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1.\n\nSo, the recurrence is Layer n = 3*Layer n-1 + 1, with Layer1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, when n=1, Layer1=4, which is 1 + 3*1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the layers starting from n=0.\n\nLet me redefine:\n\nLet Layer0 = 1\n\nThen Layer1 = 1 + 3*Layer0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\nLayer2 = 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer0 = 1.\n\nThe closed-form solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's test it for n=0:\n\nLayer0 = (3^(1) - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula is Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer9, n=9:\n\nLayer9 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems to be correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. So, the general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1)).\n\nIn our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_0=1.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1*(3^n -1))/(3 -1) = 3^n *1 + (3^n -1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which is what I had earlier. So, yes, correct.\n\nTherefore, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10} = 59049\n\nThen, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way, but I think this is solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expression without using the formula, just step by step again, to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from Layer1:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, same result. So, that must be correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.

Each layer's value is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, just to confirm.\n\nThis kind of expression is a nested multiplication, which can often be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check if this formula works with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524, and then we multiply that by 3 as per the original expression.\n\nSo, 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nThus, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using the formula as well. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, both by computing each layer manually and by deriving a general formula for the nth layer, which gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step and then applying the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, we find the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification Using Formula:**\n   The nth term of the sequence can be represented as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly because that seems quite large. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses. Let me count them again to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that's nine layers, each time adding another 1 + 3*(...). So yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just compute it again to be sure. Maybe I can use a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since the problem has nine layers, each corresponding to n=1 up to n=9, right? So, a_9 is indeed 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, each layer adds a term that's 3^n multiplied by 1, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. The recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as before. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it again step by step without using the formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1)**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my computations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the layers. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is a series of 1 + 3*(...) nested multiple times. If I denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another condition. Let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, for n=2, a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2) is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, in our case, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 87,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand all the layers, it would be 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, no, actually, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. If I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) ). Hmm, actually, when expanded, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(...), so when you multiply by 3, it's 3*1 + 3*3*(...). Let me think. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me see how many layers there are. Each time I expand, I get 3 + 3*(...). Let me try to count the number of terms. Wait, in the innermost layer, it's 1 + 3. Then, each time you go out, you have 1 + 3*(previous). So, each layer adds a term. But when you expand all the way, how many terms do you get? Let me try with a smaller number of layers to see the pattern. Suppose there is only one layer: E = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 =12. If there are two layers: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13=39. If there are three layers: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = same as two layers, but wait, no: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40=120. Wait, but in the three-layer case, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40=120. So, each additional layer adds another term in the expansion. Let's see if we can find a pattern. For 1 layer: E=12=3*4=3*(3^1 +1). Wait, 3^1 +1=4, yes. For two layers: E=39=3*(13)=3*(3^2 + 1 + 3). Wait, 3^2=9, 9 +1 +3=13. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, looking at the earlier formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then E=3*a_9=87572. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation since it worked well and gave me the correct result when I checked each layer. So, I think my initial computation is correct, and the final answer is 87,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

Let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recompute each layer from 1 to 9 to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each computation clearly. Let me rewrite the expression with each layer:\n\nStart from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But let me try computing the expression another way to cross-verify. Maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write out the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, that's the same as before. So, the value of the innermost expression is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the same answer, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, I can confirm that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work in multiple ways, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my multiplication because I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have messed up the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). So, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 appears:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before the initial 3.\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step, just to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check the multiplication again just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but since each layer depends on the previous one, it might be more straightforward to compute each layer step by step as I did.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous value). So, if I were to represent this recursively, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, computing each layer up to Layer 9, then multiplying by 3. I think that's exactly what I did, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Use the result from Layer 1.\n   - 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Use the result from Layer 2.\n   - 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Use the result from Layer 3.\n   - 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Use the result from Layer 4.\n   - 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Use the result from Layer 5.\n   - 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Use the result from Layer 6.\n   - 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Use the result from Layer 7.\n   - 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Use the result from Layer 8.\n   - 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
