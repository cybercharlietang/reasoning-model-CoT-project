Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit calculation.\n\nLet me try again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, so the result is 87572, but when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. So there's a discrepancy. That means I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit step by step:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (hundred-thousands place): 5 * 3 = 15. Add the carried 2: 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (millions place): 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (ten-millions place): 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (hundred-millions place): 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the ten-millions place, we don't have any more digits. So the result should be 87572.\n\nBut when I add 29524 three times, I get:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nSo, 88572 vs. 87572. There's a difference of 1000. So, clearly, my digit-by-digit multiplication is wrong. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me try again, carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 =15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 =6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n9 * 3=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\n5 * 3=15 +2=17. Write 7, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n9 * 3=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, 29524 only has five digits, so after the 9 in the ten-thousands place, there's no more digits. So, after writing 7 from the 9*3=27, we have a carryover of 2, but there are no more digits to multiply, so we add that carryover as the next digit. So, after the 7, we write 2. So, the result should be 87572, but when adding, we get 88572. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the addition as well. Let me check 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 +1=5\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1\n\n2 +2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7\n\n0 +5=5\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 88572, but my digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 87572. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication steps.\n\nLet me try the multiplication again, more carefully:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext:5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext:9*3=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext:5*3=15 +2=17. Write 7, carry 1.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 1 from the previous step, we add it as the next digit.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, after the 2*3=6 +1=7, we've already processed all the digits. So, the carryover 1 would be added as the next digit to the left.\n\nSo, after 7, we write 1.\n\nWait, but that would make the number 17... Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me write it out properly with each step:\n\n- Multiply 4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n- Multiply 2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carry 0.\n- Multiply 5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n- Multiply 2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carry 0.\n- Multiply 9*3=27: write 7, carry 2.\n- Multiply 5*3=15 +2=17: write 7, carry 1.\n- Multiply 2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carry 0.\n- Now, there are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 1 from the 5*3 step. So, we add that as the next digit: 1.\n\nWait, but that would make the result 17... Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the addition gave us 88572, which is a 6-digit number starting with 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me try writing it vertically:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   *       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\n5 *3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\n9 *3=27: write 7, carry 2.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 as the next digit.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the 9, there are no more digits, so the carryover 2 would be added as the sixth digit.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\nAfter processing all digits, we have:\n\nFrom right to left:\n\n2 (units place)\n\n7 (tens)\n\n5 (hundreds)\n\n7 (thousands)\n\n7 (ten thousands)\n\nAnd then the carryover 2 becomes the hundred thousands place.\n\nSo, the result is 27572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 should be larger than 80,000.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should compute each layer step by step again, ensuring that I don't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nSo, starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute this correctly.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, so earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have miscounted the carryover, leading to an incorrect result. But by breaking it down into place values, I get 88572, which matches the addition method. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I made a mistake in the initial digit-by-digit multiplication by not properly handling the carryover after the last digit. By using the place value method, I arrived at the correct result of 88572.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the previous term, starting from 1+3. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, I found that the innermost Layer9 evaluates to 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

But just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. This expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula also gives us 88572, which confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, and the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is a geometric series with ratio 3, but since it's finite (nine layers), the formula for the sum is slightly different.\n\nBut in this case, since each term is nested, it's more straightforward to model it as a recurrence relation, which we did.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation confirms the result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. 3*3=9, write 9. So yes, 88572. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding units place: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. 9 + nothing = 9. So that gives 88572 as well. Okay, so that seems correct. So the total value is 88572. But wait, did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let's see: Starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9. So, n=1 corresponds to 1 + 3, which is 4. Then n=2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), etc., up to n=9. So, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could compute each layer using the formula. For example, layer n: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, layer 1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. Layer 3: (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, yeah, it works. Therefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one. I wonder if this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would allow me to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer individually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but all our a_n so far have been integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I need to adjust it. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Wait, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.

Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers seem to be correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. So, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But what is L_0? Wait, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps L1 corresponds to n=1, and L0 would be undefined. Alternatively, maybe we can index the layers starting from 0. Let me try to adjust the indices. Suppose we define L0 = 1, then L1 = 1 + 3*L0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches our initial Layer 1. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L0 = 1. Then, the solution would be Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that: For n=0: L0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, correct. For n=1: L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, yes, the general formula is Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\nStarting from the units digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nWait, but 29524 has only five digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. But let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer more carefully, just to be sure. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach set of (1 + 3(...)) adds a layer. Let me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. From the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is (1 + 3(...)), but the first layer is (1 + 3), then the next is (1 + 3(1 + 3)), etc. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me see: The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting after the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost (1 + 3), each time we go out, we add another layer. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) is a new layer, so let me count how many times I see (1 + 3(...)):\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer after the initial 3 is (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. The first one after 3 is (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 1.\n2. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), Layer 2.\n3. Continuing until Layer 9, which is the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 as (1 + 3), then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9. So that's 9 layers. Then the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my earlier computation is correct, leading to 88572. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nFinal step: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 is done correctly. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that's a lot of computation.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach gives the same result as the step-by-step expansion. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer, this results in 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard methods. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. Therefore, a9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as a function of the previous one. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize it as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\n2. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n3. Compute the value for n=9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. This seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's better to solve it directly. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59048)/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. I think this solidifies that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and each closing parenthesis is part of the layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, this seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's see if we can find a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it. The recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation which can be solved using a formula.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can represent this recursively. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. Then, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using the method for such equations. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + B. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A is zero, but since our sequence is finite (only 9 terms), maybe this approach isn't necessary. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, we can solve it as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer follows a pattern that can be computed step by step.

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recalculate each layer to double-check. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series from the start, but since the expression is finite with 9 layers, it's manageable either way. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Let me verify:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did it step by step, I thought it was 87,572, but now with the expanded method, it's 88,572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me check again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it out: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 7 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 87,752. But that contradicts the expanded method which gave 88,572. I must be making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was incorrect because I misaligned the digits. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake earlier in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8)). But in my calculation, I computed Layer 9 as 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29,524, and then multiplied that by 3 to get 88,572. But actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's define L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, and L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can express L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Maybe that's another way to approach this problem without computing each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven L(1) = 4, let's plug in n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can also find another condition. For n=0, if we consider L(0), it would be 1, because if there were zero layers, it would just be 1. But actually, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1, so maybe n starts at 1. Alternatively, we can use the recurrence relation to find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nYes, it works. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3 * 3,280 = 9,840; 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3 * 9,841 = 29,523; 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nI wonder if there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.

Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward until reaching the final result.

There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using a Formula:**\n   The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form formula:\n   - a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n   - For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n   - Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 0 * 3 = 0, write down 0. 0 * 3 = 0, write down 0. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. So, putting it all together: 6 0 0 0 0 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I should do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, no carryover.\nThere are no more digits, so we're done.\n\nWait, but 29524 has 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when we multiply by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's 88,572. Let me verify that 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nYes, because 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000, so 29,524 \u00d7 3 should be just a bit less than 90,000, which is 88,572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had Layer 9 as 29,524, which is correct. So, yes, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it without calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. Let me see if there's a formula that could help here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of terms is small, it's probably quicker to compute each term as I did before.\n\nBut just for fun, let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. But since I might not remember the formula during an exam, computing each layer step by step is a reliable method, albeit a bit time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, expanding it, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand the entire expression, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but that's only for the innermost terms. Wait, no, because each layer is multiplied by 3, so perhaps the total expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the innermost expression first. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding all layers would give a sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Let me see:\n\nIf I have n layers, then the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which is (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The step-by-step computation is straightforward and works well. So, to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result into the next expression.\n\n3. After computing all nine layers, you get 29,524.\n\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Just to make sure, I'll go through the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29,524 *3 =88,572.\n\nYep, that all checks out. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step is straightforward, and the arithmetic seems correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's reassuring.\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication carefully:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n9*3=27, write 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 again using another method to be sure. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. It might not be a simple geometric series because each term depends on the previous one, but perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers:\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is Layer n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition Layer 1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A = 1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with Layer 1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*Layer 9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think this is solid now. No mistakes detected in the calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the formula for the nth layer, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just verify each step quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.

So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent.

Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step builds upon the previous one correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1.

So, 87572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 differently.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, so 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which is different. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try that again.\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out from top to bottom: 8 (from the 2*3 + carry), then 7 (from 9*3), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carry), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, but that would be 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572, but that contradicts the other method which gave me 88572. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let me check the digit positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But when I did the other method, breaking it into parts, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check both calculations again.\n\nFirst, using the digit-by-digit method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nNow, using the expanded method:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nHmm, so which one is correct? There's a conflict here. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to verify.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the expanded method. So, the correct answer is 88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left as we compute them: 2,7,5,7,7,8. Wait, but that would be 87572, but the correct answer is 88572. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it out properly with the correct place values:\n\n29524 is:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)\n\n9 (thousands place)\n\n5 (hundreds place)\n\n2 (tens place)\n\n4 (units place)\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 (units) *3 =12 \u2192 units digit 2, carry 1.\n\n2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit 7.\n\n5 (hundreds) *3=15 \u2192 hundreds digit 5, carry 1.\n\n9 (thousands) *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit 8, carry 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands digit 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2 (units),7 (tens),5 (hundreds),8 (thousands),8 (ten thousands). So, the number is 88572. Ah, I see! I think earlier, I was writing the digits in the wrong order. The first digit I computed was the units, then tens, etc., so the final number should be 88572, not 87572. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me go back to the layers. I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the layers are computed correctly, and the final multiplication is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3a_n +1, with a_1 =4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: B = 3B +1 \u2192 B -3B =1 \u2192 -2B=1 \u2192 B= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3C -1/2 \u2192 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and progressively compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nMultiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Let me write that down:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which would be a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe standard approach for such a recurrence is to solve it as a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. We know that a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572, which matches.\n\nSo, using the formula, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 =88572.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents.\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each layer follows a specific pattern.

So, to clarify, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, is that correct? Let me check my previous steps because 29,524 seems quite large, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572, which is a big number. Let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29,524, right? Because 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29,524. As I computed earlier, that's 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify it once more.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left.\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it together, we get 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly because if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong. Let's go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, the final computation is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8)). So, if Layer 9 is 29,524, then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make absolutely sure because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or misapply the multiplication. Let me try another approach: working from the inside out, perhaps writing each step as I go.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nExpression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) terms.

Let's denote each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nFinal computation: 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's see: Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each step adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?

However, for someone just starting out, it might be a bit time-consuming, but as long as each step is double-checked, it should be accurate.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is following the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that aligns with what I did earlier.

Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

To solve this, I can look for a pattern or solve it using standard techniques. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 As we saw earlier. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. These numbers look familiar; they might be related to powers of 3. Let me check: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683. Hmm, not exactly matching. But perhaps each L_n is (3^{n} + 1)/2 or something like that? Let's test it. For L1: (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. But L1 is 4, so that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's try that: For L1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That matches. For L2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. That matches. For L3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. That matches. L4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Yep. L5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So it seems that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*(L9) = 3*(29524) = 88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that's solid. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) follows the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer, \\(L_9 = 29524\\), and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should do it step by step without breaking it down. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88572. Wait, but wait, let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes, when you have so many layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step. Let me recompute each layer from the beginning to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar. Let's see. Here, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, maybe we need to adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 = 1, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on, with a_1 = 4. So, to find a formula for a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. Let me write down the first few terms: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nThis seems similar to the recurrence relation for the number of nodes in a ternary tree or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, to recap, by recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form formula, I can avoid computing each layer manually, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula for future reference. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.
