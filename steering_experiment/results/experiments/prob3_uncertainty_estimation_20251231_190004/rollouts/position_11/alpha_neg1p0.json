    "text": " So, it's like a chain of nine operations. To tackle this, I think I'll start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and work my way out. Let me number each parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next one: (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, up to the ninth one.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses, there are nine of them, each corresponding to a set. So, let me list them as layers 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost and layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nLayer 9: 3(...)\n\nSo, starting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) is straightforward. That's 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: It's (1 + 3*(result of Layer 1)). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(result of Layer 2)). Layer 2 was 13, so this is (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(result of Layer 3)). Layer 3 is 40, so it's (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(result of Layer 4)). Layer 4 is 121, so (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(result of Layer 5)). Layer 5 is 364, so (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(result of Layer 6)). Layer 6 is 1093, so (1 + 3*1093). Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(result of Layer 7)). Layer 7 is 3280, so (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(result of Layer 8)). Layer 8 is 9841, so (1 + 3*9841). Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, hold on. Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, I need to compute that as the final step.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step to verify.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364). 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841). 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost operation is 3*(29524). Let me compute that again. 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 9 layers deep. Each time, I computed each layer correctly, so I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if it aligns with what I got.\n\nI recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so this is a recursive relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence relation into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nBut L_n is also A*3^n + B, so:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer is L_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's all. So, the step-by-step process was to recognize the nested structure, compute each layer from the innermost outward, and then apply the outermost multiplication by 3. Alternatively, using the recursive formula allowed me to compute each layer directly without manually stepping through each one, which would have been time-consuming, especially for more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step wasn't too bad. It's also good to verify the result using a different method or by rechecking each step to ensure there are no arithmetic errors. Overall, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts made it feasible to solve without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the expression.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression has nine nested layers, each starting with \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{...})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers Using the Result from the Previous Layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Layer:**\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3), and moving outward. Let me number them for clarity. Let me denote each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s define E_n as the expression starting from the nth level. So, E_1 is the innermost: E_1 = 1 + 3 Then E_2 = 1 + 3(E_1) E_3 = 1 + 3(E_2) ... and so on, up to E_9, since there are nine sets. Wait, actually, in the given expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), which is E_9, and then E_9 is 1 + 3(E_8), and so on. So, to compute this, I need to compute E_1 first, then use that result to compute E_2, then E_3, and so on until E_9, and then multiply the whole thing by 3. So, let me start with E_1. E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, E_2 = 1 + 3(E_1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, E_2 = 13. Moving on to E_3: E_3 = 1 + 3(E_2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, E_3 = 40. Next, E_4 = 1 + 3(E_3) = 1 + 3*40. Let me compute 3*40: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, E_4 = 121. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me see if this continues. E_5 = 1 + 3(E_4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, E_5 = 364. Wait a second, so E_1 was 4, E_2 was 13, E_3 was 40, E_4 was 121, E_5 is 364. Hmm, let me check if these numbers make sense. Let me try to see if there's a recursive formula here. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, starting from E_1 = 4, each subsequent E_n is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a general formula for E_n. Let me think about that. The recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, E_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have so far to see if it works. For n = 1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: E_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: E_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: E_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n = 5: E_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can use this formula to compute E_n for any n up to 9. Since the original problem has nine levels, n goes from 1 to 9, so E_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^10. Let me calculate 3^10 step by step: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, E_9 = 29524. Now, the original expression is 3*(E_9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let me break it down. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3. Calculating each term: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 29524 * 3: 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have done 29524 * 3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me try that as a check: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524. Let me compute 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me go back and see if I miscounted the number of levels. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth level, E_9. So, I think my calculation is correct because I used n=9 in the formula. Let me confirm by computing E_6, E_7, E_8, E_9 using the recurrence relation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. So, E_1 = 4, E_2 =13, E_3=40, E_4=121, E_5=364, E_6=1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wait, earlier I thought E_5 was 364, which is correct, so E_6 should be 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's correct. So, E_9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Expression (E\u2081):**\n   \\[\n   E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Level (E\u2082):**\n   \\[\n   E_2 = 1 + 3E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Level (E\u2083):**\n   \\[\n   E_3 = 1 + 3E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Level (E\u2084):**\n   \\[\n   E_4 = 1 + 3E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Level (E\u2085):**\n   \\[\n   E_5 = 1 + 3E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Level (E\u2086):**\n   \\[\n   E_6 = 1 + 3E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Level (E\u2087):**\n   \\[\n   E_7 = 1 + 3E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Level (E\u2088):**\n   \\[\n   E_8 = 1 + 3E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Level (E\u2089):**\n   \\[\n   E_9 = 1 + 3E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next one. Let me try computing each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 uses Layer 1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now moving on to Layer 3.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nOkay, Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again. 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Okay, that seems right. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*29524 = 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. I'll write down each step as I go. First, let's identify the innermost expression. Looking at the original problem, the innermost parentheses are the last set: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer. Let me see if this pattern continues. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 + 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next, another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that layer is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 41*3 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that layer is 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that layer is 88573. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*(88573). Let me compute that: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an error with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, if I denote each step as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Since there are nine layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is a_1, and each layer out is a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9, which would be the result before the final multiplication by 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, the next step is 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, which would be a_10. Then, finally, 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assuming a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, and each layer adds another a_n until we reach a_9, which is the result after nine layers. Wait, no: actually, the innermost is a_1, then the next is a_2, up to a_9, which would correspond to the ninth layer. But in the problem, we have nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). But according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the next step is 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, which is a_10. Then, the final step is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, a_10 = (3^{11} -1)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, a_10 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. Then, 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final result is 265719. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any steps. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I worked my way outward, computing each layer step by step. Each time, I took the previous result, multiplied by 3, added 1, and moved to the next layer. After nine layers, I had a result of 29524, then one more layer gave me 88573, and finally, multiplying by 3 gave me 265719. Alternatively, using the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrived at the same result. So, I'm confident that 265719 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{expression})\\).

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), that should be the simplest part to compute first. Let me count the number of nested expressions to make sure I don't miss any. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let's see: 1. The innermost is (1 + 3). 2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). 3. Then, the next one is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). And so on, until I get to the outermost one. So, there are nine layers here. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows: Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I'll compute each layer one by one. Let's start. **Layer 1:** (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) Layer 6 is 1093. So, 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let's calculate that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) Layer 7 is 3280. So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Layer 8 is 9841. So, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3), and then each layer wraps around that. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outward. Let me try that approach. So, let's start with the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Let's compute that. Since the previous result was 4, this layer becomes (1 + 3*4). Calculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we again have (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so this becomes (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the next layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be (1 + 3*40). Let me compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, moving outward, the next layer is 121. Next layer: (1 + 3*121). Calculating that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, the next layer is 364. Moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*364). Let me compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that layer is 3280.

So, that layer is 9841. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that layer is 29524. Now, moving to the next layer out, which is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that layer is 88573. Now, finally, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. So, the innermost expression evaluates up to 265720. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, the entire expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just compute 265720 * 3 directly. Let me do that: 200000*3 = 600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, adding all these up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 = 797160. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 797,160. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then each subsequent layer: 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573, 1+3*88573=265720. Then, 3*265720=797,160. That seems correct. So, yeah, the final answer should be 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression simplifies to 797,160.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n   - 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n   - 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n3. Multiply the final result by 3: 3*265720 = 797,160.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{797160}$"

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and working my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a layer. So starting from the innermost: Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: (1 + 3(Layer 1)) Layer 3: (1 + 3(Layer 2)) ... and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one, multiplied by 3. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 = 4. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 360*3 is 1080, and 4*3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a second, just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous value. That seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the sequence is a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Since each term is a linear function of the previous term, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if that works with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is our case, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. That matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as I found before. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods agree. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern of the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": " So, it's like a chain of operations where each step depends on the next one. To tackle this, I think I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That means I'll compute the innermost 1 + 3 first, then use that result to compute the next layer, and so on, until I reach the outermost layer. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3(...). Since the innermost part is now 4, the next layer becomes 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we have 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, now we have 3280.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating that: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me figure this out: 3 times 9841 is... Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me break that down: 9000 times 3 is 27,000, 800 times 3 is 2,400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3 times 9841 is 29,523. Adding 1 gives me 29,524. So, that layer simplifies to 29,524.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29,524). Let's compute 3 times 29,524. Breaking it down: 20,000 times 3 is 60,000; 9,000 times 3 is 27,000; 500 times 3 is 1,500; 24 times 3 is 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 72 is 88,572. So, 3 times 29,524 is 88,572. Adding 1 gives me 88,573. So, that layer is 88,573.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(88,573). Calculating 3 times 88,573: Let's see, 80,000 times 3 is 240,000; 8,000 times 3 is 24,000; 500 times 3 is 1,500; 70 times 3 is 210; 3 times 3 is 9. Adding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500; 265,500 + 210 is 265,710; 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. So, 3 times 88,573 is 265,719. Adding 1 gives me 265,720. That layer simplifies to 265,720.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(265,720). Let me compute 3 times 265,720. Breaking it down: 200,000 times 3 is 600,000; 60,000 times 3 is 180,000; 5,000 times 3 is 15,000; 700 times 3 is 2,100; 20 times 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 is 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 is 797,100; 797,100 + 60 is 797,160. So, 3 times 265,720 is 797,160. Adding 1 gives me 797,161. So, that layer simplifies to 797,161.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3 times 797,161. Let me calculate that: 700,000 times 3 is 2,100,000; 90,000 times 3 is 270,000; 7,000 times 3 is 21,000; 100 times 3 is 300; 60 times 3 is 180; 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 is 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 is 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 is 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 is 2,391,483. So, 3 times 797,161 is 2,391,483.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 797,161 times 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n1 times 3 is 3.\n6 times 3 is 18; carry over 1.\n1 times 3 is 3 plus the carried 1 is 4.\n7 times 3 is 21; carry over 2.\n9 times 3 is 27 plus 2 is 29; carry over 2.\n7 times 3 is 21 plus 2 is 23; carry over 2.\n7 times 3 is 21 plus 2 is 23.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it out properly:\n\n797,161\ntimes         3\n-----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n1 * 3 = 3\n6 * 3 = 18; write down 8, carry over 1\n1 * 3 = 3 + 1 (carry) = 4\n7 * 3 = 21; write down 1, carry over 2\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 (carry) = 29; write down 9, carry over 2\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 (carry) = 23; write down 3, carry over 2\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 (carry) = 23; write down 3, carry over 2\nBut wait, there's no more digits, so the carry over 2 becomes 23 at the beginning.\n\nWait, that would make the number 23, but that's not correct. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, 797,161 is a 6-digit number. So, when multiplying by 3, let me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1st digit (units place): 1 * 3 = 3\n2nd digit (tens place): 6 * 3 = 18; write down 8, carry over 1\n3rd digit (hundreds place): 1 * 3 = 3 + 1 = 4\n4th digit (thousands place): 7 * 3 = 21; write down 1, carry over 2\n5th digit (ten thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29; write down 9, carry over 2\n6th digit (hundred thousands place): 7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23; write down 3, carry over 2\n7th digit (millions place): 7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23; write down 23.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 797,161 is only six digits. So, actually, the 7th digit doesn't exist. So, the carry over 2 after the hundred thousands place would just be added as the next digit. So, putting it all together:\n\nStarting from the right:\n3 (units)\n8 (tens)\n4 (hundreds)\n1 (thousands)\n9 (ten thousands)\n3 (hundred thousands)\nand then the carry over 2 becomes the millions place: 2.\n\nSo, the result is 2,391,483. Wait, that's the same as before. So, my initial calculation was correct. So, 3 times 797,161 is indeed 2,391,483.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\n11. Next layer: 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\n12. Next layer: 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161\n13. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*797,161 = 2,391,483\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, working from the inside out. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the final answer is correct.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. First, find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3*C = 1\n-2*C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*A - 1/2\n3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier terms to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. Starting from the innermost, each set is: (1 + 3(...)), and there are nine such layers. Wait, let me count:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is a (1 + 3(...)), and there are nine such layers before the outermost 3(...). So, in terms of the sequence a_n, n goes from 1 to 9. So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). So, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nUsing the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got a_9 as 265,720. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. When I was computing step by step, the innermost was a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Wait, no, in my step-by-step computation, I had nine layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29,524, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, no, actually, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524=88,572. But wait, that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I went up to 797,161.\n\nWait, I think I confused the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) => 1st layer: 1 + 3(...)\n\n2. The next layer is inside that: 1 + 3(...)\n\nContinuing this, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach time we go out a layer, we have another (1 + 3(...)). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count them:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers?\n\nLooking at the original expression, it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until we reach the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...) in the expression.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3 is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nEach time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses is 9, because each (1 + 3(...) adds one. Let me see:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of the first layer.\n\n- Then, inside that, another ( starts the second layer.\n\n- This continues until the ninth layer.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3), then layer 2: (1 + 3(...)), up to layer 9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nBut wait, in my step-by-step computation earlier, I had a different result. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 797,161, which was after nine layers, but perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, we have 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I went up to 797,161. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the number of layers is nine, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 is (1 + 3*(layer 8)), which is 1 + 3*(9841) = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I was computing step by step, I went beyond that, which was incorrect. I think I added an extra layer. Let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...) from the innermost:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each (1 + 3(...)) is another layer.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n1. (1 + 3) => layer 1\n\n2. (1 + 3(...)) => layer 2\n\n3. (1 + 3(...)) => layer 3\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer, so there are 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nlayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nlayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nlayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nlayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nlayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nlayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nlayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nlayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 12 layers, which was incorrect. So, the correct number of layers is 9, leading to the result 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I ended up with 2,391,483, which was 3*(797,161). But that must be wrong because I miscounted the layers.\n\nSo, the confusion arises from how many layers there are. Let me clarify:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nTherefore, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nlayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nlayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nlayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nlayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nlayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nlayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nlayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought there were nine layers, but when I computed step by step, I had nine layers leading to 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond that, which was incorrect because the original expression only has nine layers. So, my mistake was in the initial step-by-step computation where I thought there were more layers, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to recognize that there are nine layers, compute up to layer 9, which is 29,524, then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n=9, gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check this with the step-by-step computation.\n\nStarting with layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nlayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nlayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nlayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nlayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nlayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nlayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nlayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nlayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the number of layers. The original expression has nine layers, each (1 + 3(...)), so after nine layers, we get 29,524, then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the accurate result. To ensure, let me compute 3*29,524:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the initial confusion was due to miscounting the layers, but upon careful analysis, the correct number of layers is nine, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. \n\n1.

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), that's the ninth set. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, moving outward each time. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost part: Let's call each layer Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9. So, Level 1 is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Level 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 121*3: 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, hold on. The original problem is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost part and moving out, I ended up with Level 9 being 29524. But the entire expression is 3 times that. So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Maybe I messed up one of the levels.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192. So, 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each level seems to be following a recursive formula. Let me denote the value of the nth level as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nTo find another equation, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plugging A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2).\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2=364.

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), that's the ninth level. Let me number them from the inside out as levels 1 to 9. Level 1: (1 + 3) Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) ... and so on up to Level 9. So, if I compute each level starting from Level 1 and moving outward, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me start with Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to Level 2: Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Level 2 is 13. Next, Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3 is 40. Moving on to Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4 is 121. Now, Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. Breaking it down: 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, reading the digits from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that matches my previous result. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each level was computed correctly, and the final multiplication checks out.

Level 1: 3(1 + 3(...))  \nLevel 2: 3(1 + 3(...))  \n... and so on, until Level 9: (1 + 3). Wait, actually, the innermost part is the 9th level. So maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me try that. Let's define each level as follows: Let\u2019s say that each expression is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). So starting from the innermost: Level 1: 1 + 3 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) ... and so on until Level 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Wait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(...). So maybe the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Hmm, maybe I should think of it as each level being a function of the next one. Let me try to compute each level step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So Level 1: 4. Now, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(Level 1)). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Level 2: 13. Next level out: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3: 40. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4: 121. Then, (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5: 364. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6: 1093. Then, (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7: 3280. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8: 9841. Finally, the outermost level: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Level 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,000 is 87,000. Then 3*524 is 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if that approach gives the same result. The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's denote the innermost expression as S, so S = 1 + 3*(next innermost S). But since this repeats 9 times, it's a finite geometric series. The general formula for a finite geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. Wait, but in this case, each term is 1, but multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think again. Alternatively, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 levels. Let me see if I can model this as a sum. Each level adds another 3^k, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach I did earlier, which gave me 88,572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine levels of parentheses. By evaluating each level from the innermost outward, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1.

So, starting with the innermost one: Level 1: 1 + 3 Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) ... and so on, up to Level 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9. So, if I compute each level step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Level 1. Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Level 1 = 4. Now, Level 2 is 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Level 2 = 13. Moving on to Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Level 3 = 40. Next, Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3(Level 4). Level 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Level 5 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3(Level 5).

So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Level 6 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3(Level 6). Level 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3(Level 7). Level 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 = 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3(Level 8).

Let me double-check my calculations because these numbers are increasing exponentially, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, the term is being multiplied by 3 and added 1. That seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: n=4, a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: n=5, a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: n=6, a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: n=7, a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: n=8, a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: n=9, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula to find Layer 9 directly.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me think again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe found the general solution as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test it for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (27 -1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so it holds. Therefore, using the formula is a valid approach, and it's more efficient than computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe recognize that each layer is of the form \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_{n-1}\\), starting from \\(a_1 = 4\\). This recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence relation, which gives us \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\nLet's compute each layer using this formula:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(a_1 = \\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(a_2 = \\frac{3^{3} - 1}{2} = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(a_3 = \\frac{3^{4} - 1}{2} = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(a_4 = \\frac{3^{5} - 1}{2} = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(a_5 = \\frac{3^{6} - 1}{2} = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(a_6 = \\frac{3^{7} - 1}{2} = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(a_7 = \\frac{3^{8} - 1}{2} = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(a_8 = \\frac{3^{9} - 1}{2} = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9\\):\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's call the innermost part Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, okay, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer one by one. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outwards, it's Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3(Layer 2) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 3) ... and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, the outermost layer is the first one I see: 3(1 + 3(...)). So, maybe I should number them starting from the innermost as Layer 1. Let me try that. Let's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost parentheses are the last one: (1 + 3). That's Layer 1. Then moving outwards, the next layer would be (1 + 3(Layer 1)), which is Layer 2, and so on. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 step by step: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to verify. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me check the multiplication again because 29524*3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, using another method: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think I did everything correctly.

So, layer 1: 1 + 3 ( ) Wait, actually, the innermost expression is just 1 + 3, right? Because after that, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let me correct that. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 and building up. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. So, the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4.\n\nNow, moving to layer 2: This would be 1 + 3*(result from layer 1). So, substituting the value from layer 1, it becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, layer 2 evaluates to 13.\n\nNext, layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to layer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4).

Hmm, 9841*3. Let's do this step by step. 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3 = 2,400, 40*3 = 120, and 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.

So, the outermost part is 3*(layer 9). So, I think I need to compute layer 9 first, which we just found to be 29,524, and then multiply that by 3. Let me make sure I didn't skip that step.\n\nSo, the original expression is 3*(layer 9). Since layer 9 is 29,524, then the total expression is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524*3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3 = 27,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 20*3 = 60; and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute this again. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000+2,400=29,400, 29,400+120=29,520, 29,520+3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, in my earlier steps, I computed each layer correctly, ending up with 29,524 at layer 9, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a function of the previous one. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nLet me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. That might save time and reduce the chance of error, especially if there are more layers.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works perfectly. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form formula for the nth term, I was able to compute the value efficiently without manually calculating each layer. This approach reduces the chance of errors, especially with a large number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence relation, I could have continued computing each layer step by step as I did initially, which also led me to the correct answer. However, using the formula is more efficient and scalable if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn summary, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and recognizing patterns or using mathematical formulas can simplify the computation process and ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this structure. To make it manageable, I'll start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on until Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (no more layers inside) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2, and so on. So, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me recompute Layer 9's multiplication: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Yes, that's correct. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me do this multiplication again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute 29524*3 another way. Let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding digit by digit:\n\n59048\n+29524\n=?\n\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n4 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n0 + 5 = 5, write down 5.\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n5 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying my calculations, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me do that step by step: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, this is getting big. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me verify that. Each layer seems to be increasing rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication somewhere. Let me check a couple of the layers again. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524, correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think I did each step correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, which might help verify the result without computing each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost being Layer 1 and the outermost being Layer 9, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*a_9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Therefore, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result I obtained earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula, which confirms that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this nesting. That means I should start by computing the innermost part and then work my way out. Let's label each layer from the inside as Layer 1 to Layer 9 to keep track. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Since there's nothing inside the parentheses here, it's just 1 + 3, which is 4. So Layer 1 simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) That would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 simplifies to 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Now, add those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So that's 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer, Layer 1 was 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct.

Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me see if I can generalize this. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.

So, if I can compute each layer one by one, I can build up the solution. Let me write this out as separate steps, starting from the innermost expression.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, since there are nine layers, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and going out to Layer 9. But let me check: The innermost is the last one, so maybe it's better to think of it as Layer 1 being the innermost, and Layer 9 being the outermost. Hmm, perhaps that's a better approach.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, no.

Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Let me check: 20000 + 9000 is 29000, +500 is 29500, +20 is 29520, +4 is 29524. Yes.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nStarting from Layer1 to Layer9, each step seems correct:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I don't see any arithmetic errors in the computations. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the outermost multiplication by 3 is performed.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n10. Final step: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. Since there are nine sets, I might need to compute this nine times, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to approach this step by step. Let's denote each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking again, the outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so that would be Layer 9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, maybe I should index them differently. Let me think. Let's start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let's try that. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost and Layer 9 is the outermost. Wait, but actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I can compute Layer 1 to Layer 9 step by step. Let me write that down.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, hold on. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, total = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations step by step because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, total expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n*       3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n= 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one.\n\nBut just to explore, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's think about it. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer, which is layer 1, is (3^2 -1)/2=4, and layer 9 is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9= 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step was manageable, but for a larger number of layers, the formula would be more efficient.\n\nBut in this case, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, and the formula approach also gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence relation yields a closed-form formula, confirming that the final result is 88,572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this structure. I think the key here is to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way outwards. That means I'll start with the innermost parentheses, which is just 1 + 3, and then use that result to compute the next layer, and so on. Let me try that approach. Let's number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3), layer 2 is (1 + 3*(layer 1)), layer 3 is (1 + 3*(layer 2)), and so on until layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). That seems manageable. Let me write down each layer step by step. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That was easy. Now, moving to Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Each layer built upon the previous one, and the multiplication by 3 each time compounded the value quickly. It's interesting how each layer adds a significant amount due to the exponential growth from multiplying by 3 repeatedly.

Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(...)). But since we just computed the innermost part, the next layer would be (1 + 3*(4)). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*(13)). Let's compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer gives us 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each step again to check.\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses, which after nine layers is 29524. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Wait, but let me just confirm that multiplication to be sure. 29524 times 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute that. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; so 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are nine (1+3(...)) terms. Let me count them: 1. (1+3(...)) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) 4. (1+3(...)) 5. (1+3(...)) 6. (1+3(...)) 7. (1+3(...)) 8. (1+3(...)) 9. (1+3(...)) So, yes, nine layers. Therefore, my calculation of nine steps is correct, leading to 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can write a small table of each step with the layer number and the result.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29,524. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems consistent. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, maybe I can compute each step again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.  \n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 3 times 29,524 is 88,572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but given that each term is 1 + 3 times the next, it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this mathematically. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n, which might help in computing the result without having to compute each layer step by step. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence relation: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.  \nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.  \nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.  \nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.  \nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.  \nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.  \nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.  \nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.  \nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nWow, that formula works perfectly. So, using this formula, a_9 = 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. I think this is a solid approach because not only did I compute each step manually, but I also derived a general formula for the nth layer, which gave me the same result. This makes me confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed the pattern earlier and used the formula directly, but since the number of layers isn't too large (nine), computing each step manually was manageable. However, if there were, say, 20 layers, using the formula would be much more efficient.\n\nIn summary, the problem required evaluating a deeply nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the recursive structure and computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, I was able to arrive at the solution. Additionally, deriving a general formula for the nth layer provided a way to verify the result, ensuring accuracy. This problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and applying recurrence relations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the layer number, starting from the innermost as \\(a_1\\). The recurrence relation is \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9\\). Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this pattern. That means I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and then work my way out. Let me label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is multiplied by the initial 3. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Each step built upon the previous one, so I had to compute each layer sequentially. I think I did each multiplication correctly, but let me double-check a couple of layers to be sure. For example, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That seems right. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. I don't see any errors in my calculations.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this pattern. To solve this, I think I should start by evaluating the innermost part first, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9.

Wait, actually, maybe I should think of each Layer n as 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). Hmm, that might get confusing. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's try that. So, starting with the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3*(result from innermost). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12. Then Layer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39. Layer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120.

Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, the final result is 1092. Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Layer 2: 3*4 = 12. Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 4: 3*13 = 39. Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 6: 3*40 = 120. Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 8: 3*121 = 363. Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 3*364: Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Yep, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let\u2019s denote each term as a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Wait, that's not matching with my previous layers. Wait, no, actually, in my previous step-by-step, Layer 3 was 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which was 1 + 3*12 = 13. So, perhaps a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, that's not quite right because in Layer 2, we had 3*(Layer 1), which was 3*4=12, then Layer 3 is 1 + 12=13. So, perhaps each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me check: a_1=4, a_2=1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, a_4=1 + 3*40=121, a_5=1 + 3*121=364, a_6=1 + 3*364=1093. Wait, but that seems to be diverging. Wait, no, perhaps I misapplied the indices. Maybe a_n is defined as starting from the innermost, so a_1=4, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=13, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=40, a_4=1 + 3*a_3=121, a_5=1 + 3*a_4=364, a_6=1 + 3*a_5=1093, a_7=1 + 3*a_6=3280, etc. But in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers, so a_9 would be the innermost, which is 4. Then, working outward, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think: Each term is 1 + 3 times the next term, which suggests a recurrence relation. Let me denote the innermost term as T, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Wait, but in our case, there are nine layers, so perhaps it's a finite recurrence. Let me see: If I have n layers, then the value would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Let me try to find a general formula for n layers. Let me denote V(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, V(n) = 3*(1 + V(n-1)), with V(1) = 3*(1) = 3. Wait, no, because with n=1, it's just 3*(1), which is 3. But in our problem, the innermost term is (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Wait, maybe I should adjust the definition. Let me try again. Let me define V(k) as the value starting from the k-th layer, counting from the inside. So, the innermost layer is V(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, V(2) = 3*(1 + V(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, but in my step-by-step earlier, I had Layer 2 as 3*(Layer 1) = 12. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the layers. Let me clarify: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of parentheses. So, each time, we have 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let me try to model this correctly. Let me define the innermost expression as E_1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1). Then E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2). And so on, up to E_9, and the final result is 3*(1 + E_9). Wait, no, because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me think: The innermost expression is E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, each E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}). So, E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had Layer 2 as 12, which doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm not defining E_n correctly. Alternatively, maybe each E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, which would make it a bit more complicated. Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to compute each layer step by step again, carefully, to ensure I don't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n4. Layer 4: 3 * 13 = 39.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n6. Layer 6: 3 * 40 = 120.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n8. Layer 8: 3 * 121 = 363.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n10. Final result: 3 * 364 = 1092.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 1092. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric progression. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost term as E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is E_{n} = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nSo, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so E_9 would be the innermost term, and then we work outward. Wait, no, in our earlier step-by-step, E_1 was the innermost, and E_9 was the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me try to model it properly.\n\nLet\u2019s define E_k as the value of the expression starting from the k-th layer from the inside. So, E_1 is the innermost: E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, but in our problem, there are nine layers, so we need to compute up to E_9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try to list E_1 to E_9:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, that doesn't match with my earlier step-by-step. Hmm, perhaps I'm not defining E_k correctly. Because in my initial step-by-step, the outermost layer was 3*(1 + E_8), which was 3*364 = 1092. But according to this formula, E_9 would be 29524, which is way larger. So, I must have made a mistake in how I'm defining E_k.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that each E_k is being defined as 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, but in the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe I should instead define E_k as 3*(1 + E_{k-1}).\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nLet me define E_k as 3*(1 + E_{k-1}), with E_1 being the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, E_1 = 3*(1 + ...). Wait, no, the innermost is (1 + 3), so E_1 would be (1 + 3) = 4. Then, E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. E_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. E_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. E_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. E_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. E_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. E_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Then, the outermost layer would be E_9, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + E_8). Wait, no, perhaps I'm not aligning the indices correctly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on, up to the ninth layer. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but that doesn't seem right because the innermost is (1 + 3), not multiplied by 3 yet. Hmm, maybe I should think of the layers as follows:\n\nThe innermost term is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. The second layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48. The third layer is 3*(1 + 48) = 147. The fourth layer is 3*(1 + 147) = 444. The fifth layer is 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. The sixth layer is 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. The seventh layer is 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. The eighth layer is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. The ninth layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. Wait, but that doesn't match my initial step-by-step. I think I'm getting confused because the way I'm defining the layers is inconsistent. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I only went up to Layer 9 being 364, and then the final result was 3*364 = 1092. But according to this, a_5 is 1092, which would correspond to five layers. So, perhaps the problem has nine layers, which would make the final result 88572. But that contradicts my initial calculation. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a layer, and the number of such instances is nine. So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, let me define the innermost as Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but according to this, the ninth layer is 36084, and then the final result would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. But that doesn't match my initial step-by-step. Wait, perhaps I'm not counting the layers correctly. Let me try a different approach: Let me parse the expression step by step, counting the number of layers.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3*\" segments. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3).\n\n2. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\n- The first layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n- The second layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n- The third layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n- The fourth layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\n- The fifth layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\n- The sixth layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\n- The seventh layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\n- The eighth layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\n- The ninth layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but that's nine layers of 3*(1 + ...), but in the original problem, the expression starts with 3*(1 + ...), so the total number of layers would be nine, meaning the final result is 108255. But that contradicts my initial calculation where I only had nine layers leading to 1092. I must be making a mistake in how I'm counting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial problem has nine instances of \"1 + 3(...)\", so the number of layers is nine, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to model this correctly.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term), starting with the innermost term as 3.\n\nWait, no, the innermost term is (1 + 3), so let's define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had only nine layers leading to 1092. I think the confusion is that I was miscounting the layers. Let me recount the number of layers in the original problem. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n- Starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, each time we go outward, we have another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nSo, the number of layers is nine, as each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer.\n\nTherefore, using the a_n sequence as above, the final result would be a_9 = 36084, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I only went up to nine layers and got 1092. I think I must have miscounted the layers. Let me try to compute each layer again carefully.\n\nLet me start over:\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had only nine layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous), but perhaps I was missing that the final expression is 3*(1 + Layer 9), which would be the tenth layer. Hmm, no, because the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), with nine \"1 + 3*\" layers. So, perhaps the total number of multiplications by 3 is nine, and the final result is 3*(1 + a_9), where a_9 is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\n10. Finally, 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but that would be ten layers, but the problem has nine \"1 + 3*\" instances. So, perhaps the correct number of layers is nine, leading to the ninth layer being 36084, and then the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach where I got 1092 is correct because I was only considering nine layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous), without an extra multiplication at the end. Let me check the original problem again: It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), and inside that, there are eight more \"1 + 3*(...)\" instances, making a total of nine layers. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), up to nine layers. So, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with my initial calculation where I only went up to Layer 9 being 364, leading to 3*364 = 1092. I think the confusion is that in my initial approach, I was considering each layer as 1 + 3*(previous), but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, perhaps the correct way is to compute each layer as 3*(1 + previous), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nSo, let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but that's a different result than my initial calculation. I think the key is to correctly model each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 15, Layer 3: 48, Layer 4: 147, Layer 5: 444, Layer 6: 1335, Layer 7: 4008, Layer 8: 12027, Layer 9: 36084. Then, the final expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps the correct answer is 108255. However, in my initial step-by-step, I only went up to Layer 9 being 364, leading to 1092. I must have made a mistake in the initial approach by not correctly applying the 3*(1 + ...) at each layer.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer again carefully:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) ="

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), that should be the simplest part to compute first. Let me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. Let's say the innermost is level 1, then moving outward, level 2, up to level 9. So, starting with level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one level out, level 2: 1 + 3*(result from level 1). Since level 1 gave us 4, this would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, level 2 is 13. Now, moving to level 3: 1 + 3*(result from level 2). Level 2 was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, level 3 is 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(result from level 3). Level 3 was 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(result from level 4). 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(result from level 5). 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(result from level 6). 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(result from level 7). 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, level 9: 1 + 3*(result from level 8). 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this level 9 result. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the inside: Level 1: 1+3=4. Level 2: 1+3*4=13. Level 3: 1+3*13=40. Level 4: 1+3*40=121.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, and work my way out. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 simplifies to 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) That's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) Which is 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) That's 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) That's 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) Which is 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) That's 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the expression simplifies to 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did each step carefully, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I guess another way to look at it is recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which forms a geometric series or something similar. But since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression, but I think for this problem, since it's a fixed number of layers, computing each step is manageable. So, yeah, I think I got it right. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down layer by layer:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outwards. Let me try that. Let's label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost, multiplied by 3. So, if I compute each layer one by one, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400. 29,400 + 120 is 29,520. 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. So Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29,524. Let me do that: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500. 88,500 + 60 is 88,560. 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572.

    "text": " So, if I start from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and work my way out, that should help me compute each step without getting lost. Let's start by numbering these parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. Let me assign numbers 1 through 9 to each set of parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, maybe numbering them from the inside out would be better. So the innermost is the 9th set, and the outermost is the 1st set. Hmm, maybe I should just work from the inside out without numbering. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 3 times that innermost part. So, the next level is 3*(1 + 3(...)), where the innermost part is 4. So, let's compute that. Wait, no, actually, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So, perhaps I should compute each level one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to outline each step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Then, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from step 1).\n3. Continue this process, each time computing the next outer expression using the result from the previous step.\n\nYes, that seems like a solid approach. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(result from Step 1)). Plugging in the value from Step 1, that's (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next level out is (1 + 3*(result from Step 2)). So, that's (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next, (1 + 3*(result from Step 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Then, (1 + 3*(result from Step 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Next, (1 + 3*(result from Step 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Then, (1 + 3*(result from Step 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next, (1 + 3*(result from Step 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost expression is (1 + 3*(result from Step 8)) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, the entire expression inside is (1 + 3*(...)) which we just computed as 29524. So, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake here? Because in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which we just found to be 29524. So, 3*29524 is the final answer.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps because that seems like a very large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error along the way.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500. So, 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72. So, 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572. But let me verify that multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check if I correctly identified the number of steps. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, right? Each time I did a step, I was moving one level out, so from step 1 to step 9, that's nine levels. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recount the number of times I applied the operation. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))).\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost, each set is one step. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent is (1 + 3*(previous)), so that's nine steps. So, yes, step 1 to step 9, each time computing the next outer expression.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the number of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nYes, that's nine sets, so nine steps. Therefore, the final computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Let me think about it. Each step seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the nth term, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1, a1=4.\n\nn=2, a2=1+3*a1=1+12=13.\n\nn=3, a3=1+3*a2=1+39=40.\n\nn=4, a4=1+3*a3=1+120=121.\n\nn=5, a5=1+3*a4=1+363=364.\n\nn=6, a6=1+3*a5=1+1092=1093.\n\nn=7, a7=1+3*a6=1+3279=3280.\n\nn=8, a8=1+3*a7=1+9840=9841.\n\nn=9, a9=1+3*a8=1+29523=29524.\n\nSo, a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D.\n\nThen, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed the pattern earlier and used the closed-form formula to compute a9 directly without computing each step, but since I was unsure at first, stepping through each level made me confident in the result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous + 1. That's exactly what we did in the step-by-step approach.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer starting from the innermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that, leading to the final result of 88572 when multiplied by the outermost 3.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked my work using two different methods: step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula, both leading to the same result. I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(next layer).

Let's label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: It's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this structure. That means I need to compute starting from the innermost one and work my way out. Let me start by identifying the innermost expression. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next layer is (1 + 3*(innermost)), and so on. Let me write down each layer step by step to keep track. Let me number the layers from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) ... and so on until Layer 9.

Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4 correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=13 correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=40 correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121 correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=364 correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, maybe? Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, this is similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, actually, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me model it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... up to a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the earlier result. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so the final computation is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods of computing step by step and using the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct value for the given expression.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000. 87000 + 1500 is 88500. 88500 + 60 is 88560. 88560 + 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = (1 + 3*13) 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = (1 + 3*40) 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = (1 + 3*121) 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364) Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = (1 + 3*1093) Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = (1 + 3*3280) Compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = (1 + 3*9841) Now, compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nine-layer expression we just computed. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1 up: Layer 1: 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think I did this correctly. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. Each layer was just a simple multiplication and addition, so as long as I didn't make any arithmetic errors, the final answer should be correct. I guess another way to approach this would be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but since each layer only has one multiplication and addition, it's straightforward to compute each layer individually. Alternatively, if I were to write this as a recursive formula, maybe I could see a pattern. Let me think about that for a moment. Let\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Then, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, which in this case is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation can lead to a more efficient solution, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that if I have to deal with a similar problem with more layers, I can use the formula to find the result without computing each layer individually. In summary, the key steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result. 3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, then compute the desired layer and multiply by 3. Both methods led to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the inside out, we find that each layer can be represented by a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3(...), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So, each level is 1 + 3 times something, and that something is another level just like it. That seems recursive. Maybe I can compute each level one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me number the levels for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Level 1: 1 + 3. Then Level 2 would be 1 + 3(Level 1), and so on, up to Level 9, which is the outermost one. So, I can compute each level step by step. Let me write that down.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. So, Level 1 is 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Level 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nLet me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let's break it down. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original problem is 3 times the outermost Level 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that big nested part. So, the total expression is 3*(Level 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 is a large number and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nNo more digits, but there's a carryover 2, so write that down.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let's see:\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 29,524, which is 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations in the Levels. Let me go through each Level again quickly.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each Level builds correctly upon the previous one, and the multiplication at the end is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula that could represent this expression without computing each level manually. Maybe that would be a more efficient way, especially if the number of levels were larger.\n\nLooking at the expression, each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is given by:\n\na_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r)\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, the value at Level 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) =88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since each level is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, the outermost level is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 /2 =88572. Which is the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nThis is interesting because it shows that recognizing the pattern early on could save a lot of time, especially if the number of levels were more than 9. But since it's only 9 levels, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but having a formula is still useful.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested sum where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer, and there are 9 such layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Then, multiplying this by 3 gives us the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested term from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous level, starting from Level 1 up to Level 9. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost level by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3(...), with nine levels in total.\n\n2. **Compute each level starting from the innermost:**\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost level by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this structure. That suggests that I need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me assign each layer a number to make it easier. I'll call the innermost one Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding the 1: 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, that means the expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check one of the layers again. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. How about Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct again. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 24*3 is 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 72 is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression has nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...).\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and then moving outward. Let me assign each nested part a step to make it easier. Let's number them from inside out as Step 1 to Step 9. \n\nStep 1: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple. 1 + 3 is 4. \n\nStep 2: Next, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3(Step 1)). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nStep 3: Next level out is (1 + 3(Step 2)). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nStep 4: Then, (1 + 3(Step 3)). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nStep 5: Next, (1 + 3(Step 4)). That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nStep 6: Moving out another level, (1 + 3(Step 5)). So, 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next, (1 + 3(Step 6)). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Now, (1 + 3(Step 7)). So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost part is (1 + 3(Step 8)). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, after computing the last step, which gave me 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. \n\nLet me break this down: 20000 * 3 is 60000, 9000 * 3 is 27000, 500 * 3 is 1500, 20 * 3 is 60, and 4 * 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems too large. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check my steps because I might have miscalculated one of the steps, especially since the numbers are getting quite big.\n\nStarting from Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me verify the multiplication step again because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Yes, because 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each step seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach nested term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me consider the general case. Suppose I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)). If this goes on infinitely, it converges to a certain value, but in this case, it's finite, with nine levels. Maybe I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the same as before. So, maybe my initial calculation is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute one or two steps again.\n\nLet me recompute Step 5: a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4. a_4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7: a_7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8: a_8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: a_9 = 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I can't see any mistake in the steps I took, so I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each level is computed step by step, resulting in the final value of 29,524 before multiplying by 3, yielding 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's say the innermost is Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) ... and so on, up to Level 9, which is the outermost. So, I can compute each level step by step. Let me start with Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Level 2: Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. Hmm, 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3 is 40. Moving on to Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Therefore, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), that's the ninth set. Let me label each set from 1 to 9 for clarity. Let's define each part as follows:\n\nLet me define each inner expression as a variable to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- E1 = 1 + 3\n- E2 = 1 + 3(E1)\n- E3 = 1 + 3(E2)\n- E4 = 1 + 3(E3)\n- E5 = 1 + 3(E4)\n- E6 = 1 + 3(E5)\n- E7 = 1 + 3(E6)\n- E8 = 1 + 3(E7)\n- E9 = 1 + 3(E8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3 * E9.\n\nSo, if I compute each E from E1 to E9, starting from the innermost, I can build up the solution step by step.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving outward to E2:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3(E1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, E2 is 13. Next, E3:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3(E2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, E3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3(E3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE4 is 121. Next up, E5:\n\nE5 = 1 + 3(E4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE5 is 364. Continuing on to E6:\n\nE6 = 1 + 3(E5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE6 is 1093. Now, E7:\n\nE7 = 1 + 3(E6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE7 is 3280.

Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute E9 again:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is four digits, so let me do it properly:\n\n9841\nx   3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 2 = 29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the 29 as 29, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, actually, 9841 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\nCompute 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the number of nested expressions correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first one, then each subsequent one adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's see: starting from the first 3(...), inside it is 1+3(...), so that's one layer. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), so two layers, and so on until the innermost (1+3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after 1+3:\n\nEach time, after 1+3, there's an opening parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the ninth layer because each time we go one layer up, we add another (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), which is E1, then each layer up adds another E. So, in total, there are nine layers of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, E9 is the outermost expression, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so each E is 1 + 3*previous E.\n\nSo, starting from E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*E9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each E step again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 once more:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I've checked each step, and each calculation seems accurate. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested terms from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the value of the innermost expression and substituting it into the outer expressions until the entire expression is simplified.
