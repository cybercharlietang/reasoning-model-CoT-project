    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, let me make sure. The next layer is 3*(innermost result). So, after computing the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). But wait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive structure where each term is 3*(1 + next term). Let me try to define it as such. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, L1 is (1 + 3). Then L2 is 3*(1 + L1). Then L3 is 3*(1 + L2), and so on, until L9, which would be the outermost layer. So, if I compute each L from L1 to L9, I can find the final result. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nNext, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nThen L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nContinuing, L5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nNext, L6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nThen L7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nMoving on, L8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nFinally, L9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct.\n\nHmm, so each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time. Wait, actually, it's more like each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each time, we're adding 3 to 1, then multiplying by 3. Let me see if there's a pattern here or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an error in one of the steps.\n\nWait, so each layer is defined by L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L1 = 4.\n\nThis looks like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern in the values I've computed:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 15\n\nL3 = 48\n\nL4 = 147\n\nL5 = 444\n\nL6 = 1335\n\nL7 = 4008\n\nL8 = 12027\n\nL9 = 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, actually, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find A and B.\n\nGiven L1 = 4, which is when n=1.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nBut I need another equation to solve for A and B. Maybe I can compute L2 using the recurrence.\n\nL2 = 3*L1 + 3 = 3*4 + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15, which matches.\n\nUsing the general solution for L2:\n\nL2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 15.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 15\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 15 - 4\n\n6A = 11 => A = 11/6.\n\nNow, plugging A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(11/6) + B = 4 => 11/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 11/2 = (8/2 - 11/2) = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this works for n=1 and n=2.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nL1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = 11/2 - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\nL2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = 99/6 - 3/2 = 33/2 - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works for the first two terms. Let me check for n=3.\n\nUsing the formula: L3 = (11/6)*3^3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=4:\n\nL4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for any n, L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, we have L9, which is the outermost layer. So, n=9.\n\nLet me compute L9 using the formula.\n\nL9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nFirst, compute 3^9. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683.\n\nNow, plug into the formula:\n\nL9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nFirst, compute (11/6)*19683.\n\nLet me compute 19683 \u00f7 6 first.\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5.\n\nNow, multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3280.5 * 10 = 32805\n\n3280.5 * 1 = 3280.5\n\nAdd them together: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5.\n\nSo, (11/6)*19683 = 36085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5.\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents and the fractions. Let me double-check 3^9.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683. Correct.\n\nNow, (11/6)*19683.\n\nLet me compute 19683 \u00f7 6:\n\n6 \u00d7 3280 = 19680, so 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5. Correct.\n\nThen, 3280.5 \u00d7 11:\n\n3280.5 \u00d7 10 = 32805\n\n3280.5 \u00d7 1 = 3280.5\n\nTotal: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5. Correct.\n\nSubtracting 1.5 gives 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 3*(1 + previous), and there are 9 layers, starting from L1=4, we can compute it as L9=36084.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recursive formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 3*(1 + previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part and then work my way out. Let me try to identify the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). So, let me compute that first. (1 + 3) equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that part simplifies to 13. Now, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so that simplifies to 40. I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me see if I can generalize this. Let's denote each level as follows: Let\u2019s say starting from the innermost, which is level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, after computing all the levels up to level 9, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, I need to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that confirms it. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the levels. Let me recount each level step by step to ensure accuracy. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with multiple levels. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the levels I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for level n=9, which is the outermost parentheses before the final multiplication by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 /2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the inner expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth level evaluates to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th level, this is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I move out a layer, I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to keep track of this systematically. Maybe I can define each layer as a step and compute each step one by one. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is a\u2081 = 1 + 3, then each subsequent a is built by 1 + 3*a_previous. So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Hmm, let me see:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. It seems like there are 9 such layers. So, perhaps I can compute each a\u2081 through a\u2089 step by step.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we have another (1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the center, each step adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, maybe it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nBut perhaps I should just compute each step manually to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me start:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this a\u2081 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this a\u2082 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. a\u2083 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a\u2084 = 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a\u2085 = 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a\u2086 = 1093.\n\n7.

Next layer: 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nWait, so a\u2089 is 29524, which is the result of the innermost expression when expanded all the way out. But wait, the original expression is 3*(a\u2089). So the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a\u2089, which is 29524. Therefore, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but that's breaking down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, which might not be the most efficient way.

Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the a\u2089 value. Let me go through each step again to check.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo a\u2089 is indeed 29524, and 3*a\u2089 is 88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original expression is 3*(a\u2089). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize this as a geometric series or find a formula for a\u2099, but since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually as I did.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one more layer to see if the pattern holds.\n\nWait, a\u2081=4, a\u2082=13, a\u2083=40, a\u2084=121, a\u2085=364, a\u2086=1093, a\u2087=3280, a\u2088=9841, a\u2089=29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation: a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1.\n\nI remember that for such recurrence relations, the solution can be expressed as a\u2099 = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check if that formula works for the a\u2081 through a\u2089 I've calculated.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. But a\u2081 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, a\u2081=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a\u2082=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a\u2083=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, a\u2084=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, a\u2085=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, a\u2086=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, a\u2087=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, a\u2088=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, a\u2089=29524.\n\nSo, the general formula for a\u2099 is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's a good check. So, for n=9, a\u2089=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089=3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, that confirms that the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula check using the geometric series approach also aligns with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\). Let this be \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\). Let this be \\(a_2 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\). Let this be \\(a_3 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\). Let this be \\(a_4 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\). Let this be \\(a_5 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\). Let this be \\(a_6 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\). Let this be \\(a_7 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\). Let this be \\(a_8 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\cdot a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\). Let this be \\(a_9 = 29524\\).\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\cdot a_9\\). Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by computing the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me try that. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, so it's 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next level out simplifies to 13. Now, moving another level out, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that level simplifies to 40. Continuing this pattern, the next level would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let's see: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, that simplifies to 364. Moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364. Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that level becomes 1093. Next layer out is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer, the expression is 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that simplifies to 9841. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524. Now, moving out another layer, which is the outermost one, it's 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that simplifies to 88573. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Wait, no, that's not correct because 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Now, adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check one of the steps again to be sure. Let's take the step where I computed 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That looks correct. Another check: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. That's correct. Then, 3*88573: Let me compute that again. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final result is 265719. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because the number seems quite large, but considering that each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it does add up quickly. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. I notice that each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(something), which resembles a geometric series. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute that. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, that's the same result as before! So, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, earlier I thought the entire expression was 3*a_9, but according to the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_9. But according to the general formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, but earlier I got 265719. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct? Let me check. According to the step-by-step computation, I ended up with 265719, but using the formula, I get 88572. Clearly, one of them must be wrong. Let me see where I messed up. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of terms. Let me see: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from (1 + 3), which is a_1, then the next is a_2, up to a_9. So, a_9 is the innermost, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. But in my step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 265719, which is 3*88573. Wait, so in my step-by-step, I computed up to a_9 = 29524, then I thought the entire expression was 3*a_9, which would be 88572. But in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond a_9, perhaps. Wait, no, let me recount. Wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, in my step-by-step, I started from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer outwards up to the ninth layer, which would be a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But in my initial calculation, I went beyond that, perhaps miscalculating the number of layers. Wait, let me recount the layers. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, the first layer is 1 + 3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count them:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more step. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean a_1 to a_9. So, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. But in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 88573, which would be a_10, perhaps? Wait, no, because the expression is 3*(a_9). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step by going one layer too far. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how many layers are present. Let me parse the expression again:\n\nStarting from the outermost 3(, then inside it is (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \nSo, starting from the first \"1 + 3(\", that's layer 1, then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\n- The first layer is \"1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\" but wait, no, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, the first layer is \"1 + 3(\", the next is \"1 + 3(\", and so on. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3( is layer 1.\n2. Then another \"1 + 3(\" inside that is layer 2.\n3. And so on, until the innermost \"1 + 3(\" which would be layer 9.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\" expressions. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. But in my initial step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 265719, which is 3*88573. Wait, that suggests that I computed a_10 instead of a_9. So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount the layers carefully.\n\nLet me write the expression with layer numbers:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3( ... )) where ... is layer 2.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3( ... ) where ... is layer 3.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3( ... ) where ... is layer 4.\n\n...\n\nContinuing until layer 9: 1 + 3( ... ) where ... is layer 10: (1 + 3).\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the innermost expression is layer 9, and the outermost is layer 1. So, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3).\n\nThen layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 9).\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 8).\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 1: 1 + 3*(layer 2).\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(layer 1).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond layer1, computing up to 88573, which would be layer0 or something. So, I think I made a mistake by going one layer too far. So, the correct answer should be 88572, not 265719. Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nAfter computing up to layer9 (which is layer9 = 29524), then the next step was 3*29524 = 88572, which is the entire expression. So, in my initial step-by-step, I thought that was the final answer, but then I continued and got 265719, which must be wrong. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused myself. Let me clarify:\n\nThe expression is 3*(layer1), where layer1 is 1 + 3*(layer2), layer2 is 1 + 3*(layer3), etc., down to layer9 = (1 + 3). So, layer9 = 4, layer8 = 13, layer7 = 40, layer6 = 121, layer5 = 364, layer4 = 1093, layer3 = 3280, layer2 = 9841, layer1 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*layer1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond layer1, computing layer0 as 1 + 3*88572 = 265717, but that's incorrect because the expression stops at layer1. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went all the way to 265719. So, I must have miscounted the layers. Let me recount:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear? Let's see:\n\n- After the initial 3(, there's a \"1 + 3(\" which is layer1.\n\n- Inside that, another \"1 + 3(\", which is layer2.\n\n- Continuing until the innermost, which would be layer9.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\" expressions. Therefore, layer1 is the outermost, layer9 is the innermost.\n\nSo, layer9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nlayer8: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nlayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nlayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nlayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nlayer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nlayer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nlayer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nlayer1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572, not 265719. I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by miscalculating the number of layers and going one step too far. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this using the formula I derived earlier. The formula was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscalculating the number of layers and going one step too far in my step-by-step computation. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 1:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from innermost)). So, that would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now I have 40. The next layer out is (1 + 3*40). Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that gives me 121. Moving another layer out, it's (1 + 3*121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. So, now I have 364. Next layer is (1 + 3*364). Let's see, 3*364 is 1092, and adding 1 gives 1093. So, that's 1093. The next layer is (1 + 3*1093). Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, now we have 3280. Moving another layer out, it's (1 + 3*3280). Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. That's 9841. Next layer is (1 + 3*9841). Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that's 29524. The next layer is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Adding 1 gives 88573. So, now I have 88573. The next layer is (1 + 3*88573). Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding these together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Adding 1 gives 265720. So, that's 265720. Now, the next layer is (1 + 3*265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding these together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Adding 1 gives 797161. So, that's 797161. Now, moving to the outermost layer, which is 3*(result from the previous step). So, 3*797161. Let me compute that. 700000*3 is 2100000, 90000*3 is 270000, 7000*3 is 21000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, and 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 3*797161 equals 2391483. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2391483. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost part: (1+3)=4. Then, each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524, 1 + 3*29524=88573, 1 + 3*88573=265720, 1 + 3*265720=797161. Then, finally, 3*797161=2391483. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1, which is consistent with the structure of the expression. So, I think the answer is 2,391,483.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses, each step involves multiplying the current result by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process for each layer from the inside out leads to the final result of 2,391,483.\n\n$\\boxed{2391483}$"

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds a certain value, and I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to parse it layer by layer. Let me start by labeling each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, wait, that seems to be the entire expression. Maybe I should instead work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each step as I go. Let me try that. Let me start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost parentheses is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses. Wait, but actually, looking at the problem, I think the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), so maybe it's 8 layers? Wait, let me check: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is Layer 1, then moving outward, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 1+3( starts a new layer, so from the initial 3, we have 9 layers. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs. Each time, it's a new layer. So, from the innermost, the first is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around with another 1 + 3*(...).

The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is (1+3), Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nYes, so 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but hold on: Wait, a_1 is the first term, which is 4. But in our case, a_1 corresponds to Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nBut in the standard linear recurrence, n starts at 0, but here, our a_1 is the first term. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nLet me define a_0 = 4, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can shift the index.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula to fit our problem.\n\nWait, our first term is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nSo, using the general solution: a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by solving the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost one. Let me assign variables to each layer to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, maybe that's a good approach. So I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving up to Layer 9, then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so adding those together, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step depends on the previous one, so if I messed up one layer, it would affect all subsequent layers. Let me verify each layer quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So each time, it's 3 multiplied by a term that is 1 plus 3 times another term. So it's like a geometric series or something? Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is what I did earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n-1}. Wait, but since r > 1, the term (c/(1 - r)) is negative, so it might not apply here directly. Let me check the formula again.\n\nActually, the solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is given by a_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1) + c*( (r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1) ). Let me plug in the values here.\n\nHere, a_1 = 4, r = 3, c = 1. So the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 3^{n-1}*4 + 1*( (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1) ). Simplifying, that's a_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nCombining terms, let's factor out 3^{n-1}: a_n = (4 + 0.5)*3^{n-1} - 0.5 = 4.5*3^{n-1} - 0.5. Hmm, but 4.5 is 9/2, so a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1. For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 should be 13. Plugging in n=2: (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Which matches Layer 3. Good.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first parenthesis after the initial 3, each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nEach time we have \"1+3(...)\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are 9 layers in total because each time we have a new \"1+3(...)\" and we start from the innermost one as Layer 1, so Layer 9 would be the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3\" inside. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. Therefore, n=9 for Layer 9.\n\nUsing the formula, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^8. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2.\n\nCompute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute that. 6561*9: 6000*9=54,000; 500*9=4,500; 60*9=540; 1*9=9. Adding up: 54,000 + 4,500 = 58,500; 58,500 + 540 = 59,040; 59,040 + 9 = 59,049. So 9*6561=59,049.\n\nThen, (9/2)*6561 = 59,049 / 2 = 29,524.5.\n\nNow, subtract 1/2: 29,524.5 - 0.5 = 29,524. So a_9 = 29,524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially with the exponents and multiplications.\n\nWait, when I computed 3^8, I got 6561, which is correct because 3^8 is 6561. Then, 9/2 is 4.5, so 4.5*6561: Let me compute that again. 6561*4 = 26,244 and 6561*0.5=3,280.5. So 26,244 + 3,280.5 = 29,524.5. Then subtract 0.5 gives 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo 3*29,524: 29,524*3. Let me compute that:\n\n29,524*3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but the structure here is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So it's not a simple geometric series, but a linear recurrence. However, by solving the recurrence, I was able to find a closed-form expression for the nth term, which made the computation much easier, especially for multiple layers.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution to such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Wait, but earlier I had a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me see if these are equivalent.\n\n(3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3*3^n)/2 - 1/2 = 3^{n+1}/2 - 1/2.\n\nBut in my earlier formula, I had a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2, which is (9/2)*(3^{n-1}) - 1/2. Let me see if these are the same.\n\nNote that 3^{n+1} = 3^2 * 3^{n-1} = 9*3^{n-1}. So, 3^{n+1}/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1}. Therefore, (3^{n+1}/2 - 1/2) is equal to (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2, which matches my earlier formula. So both forms are consistent. Good.\n\nTherefore, using the general solution, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which is the same as before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, consistent again.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let's try that. Let me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say the innermost part is layer 1, then moving outward, layer 2, and so on up to layer 9. So layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer1). Wait, no, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each layer as I go. Let's try that approach. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on, until L9 = 1 + 3*L8. Then the entire expression is 3*L9. Wait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So yes, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So let me compute each layer step by step.

Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120 + 3 = 123? Wait, no, 121*3 is 363, right? Because 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. So 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen the final step: 3*29524.

Correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nL1: 1+3=4.\n\nL2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\n3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it can be expressed recursively or using a formula.\n\nLet me consider the general case where we have n layers. Let's denote the value after k layers as L_k. So, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI notice that each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when k=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, 3^{k+1}/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for k layers, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, L_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again to be absolutely sure. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct.\n\nThen, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost outwards. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form solution, we find that the value after nine layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Calculation:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first. Let me try that. Let's denote each inner expression as a separate step. So, starting from the innermost part: Let me call the innermost expression E9: E9 = 1 + 3 Then, moving outwards, E8 = 1 + 3*E9, then E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, until I get to E0, which would be the entire expression. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E8), since the outermost is 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I should number them from the inside out. Let me try that. So, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is E1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving one step out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, until E9, which would be the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. But wait, the problem is 3*(E8), because there are nine sets of parentheses, so E1 is the innermost, and E9 would be the one just before the final multiplication. Wait, maybe I should count how many times 3 is multiplied. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, after the 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of these. Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 inside. So, the first is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on. Let me see: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the first 3, I can see that there are 8 more 3s inside, each multiplying a (1 + ...). So, that would mean there are 9 layers in total, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should define each layer as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost before the final 3. Wait, but the problem is 3*(E9). So, E1 = 1 + 3 E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 ... up to E9 = 1 + 3*E8 Then the entire expression is 3*E9. So, I can compute E1 to E9 step by step. Let me try that.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524. Let's see:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did each step correctly because sometimes when you have a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each Ei again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without having to calculate each step manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nThis kind of expression is a recursive one, where each term is defined in terms of the next. It looks like a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see if I can find a general formula for En where En = 1 + 3*En+1. Wait, no, actually, each En = 1 + 3*En-1, since each term depends on the previous one. Wait, no, actually, in our case, En = 1 + 3*En+1, but that would imply a reverse recursion. Maybe I should think of it as En = 1 + 3*En-1, but in our case, we're starting from the innermost and moving outward, so each En is built from En+1. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to write the recurrence relation. Let's say that En = 1 + 3*En-1, where E1 = 4, as we saw earlier. Wait, but in our case, E1 is the innermost, so E1 = 1 + 3 = 4, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, En = 1 + 3*En-1, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is En = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B = 1 + 3B \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is En = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4. When n=1, E1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, En = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: En = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: E5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: E6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: E7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: E8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: E9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, En = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute En directly without having to compute each step, which is especially useful if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general formula.\n\nAlternatively, we can also recognize that the entire expression is a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach En = 1 + 3*En-1, starting from E1 =4.\n\nIf we expand E9, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which can be written as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 =1 +3*(1 +3*E7)=1 +3 +3^2*E7=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*E6)=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*E6, and so on, until we reach E1=4.\n\nSo, expanding all the way, E9 = 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8 +3^9*E1.\n\nSince E1=4=1+3, which is 1 +3^1.\n\nWait, but E1=4=1+3, so when we plug that into E9, we get:\n\nE9=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8 +3^9*(1 +3) = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k + 3^9*3.\n\nWait, sum_{k=0}^9 3^k is a geometric series with sum (3^10 -1)/2, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen, adding 3^9*3 =3^10, so E9 = (3^10 -1)/2 +3^10 = (3^10 -1 +2*3^10)/2 = (3*3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -1)/2.\n\nWait, but that's not matching our earlier calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation there.\n\nWait, E9= sum_{k=0}^9 3^k +3^9*3 = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k +3^10.\n\nSum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nHere, n=9, so sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThen, adding 3^{10} gives us E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 +3^{10} = (3^{10} -1 +2*3^{10})/2 = (3*3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but from our earlier step-by-step computation, E9 was (3^{10} -1)/2, not (3^{11} -1)/2. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again.\n\nE9 = 1 +3*E8.\n\nBut E8=1 +3*E7.\n\nSo, E9=1 +3*(1 +3*E7)=1 +3 +3^2*E7.\n\nSimilarly, E7=1 +3*E6, so E9=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*E6)=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*E6.\n\nContinuing this way, we'd get E9=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8 +3^9*E1.\n\nSince E1=1 +3=4, which is 1 +3^1, so plugging that in:\n\nE9= sum_{k=0}^9 3^k +3^9*(1 +3) = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k +3^9 +3^{10}.\n\nSo, sum_{k=0}^9 3^k is (3^{10} -1)/2, as before.\n\nAdding 3^9 and 3^{10} gives:\n\nE9= (3^{10} -1)/2 +3^9 +3^{10} = (3^{10} -1 +2*3^9 +2*3^{10})/2.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Let me compute it numerically.\n\n3^{10}=59049, so 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 +19683 +59049 = (59048)/2 +19683 +59049=29524 +19683 +59049.\n\nAdding 29524 +19683 =49207, then +59049=108256.\n\nWait, but from our earlier step-by-step calculation, E9=29524, so this approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.\n\nEach En can be expressed as En = 1 + 3*En-1, with E1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation as a linear nonhomogeneous equation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is En^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume En^(p) = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A =1 +3*A \u2192 A=1 +3A \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is En = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E1=4:\n\n4= C*3^1 -1/2 \u21924=3C -1/2 \u21923C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, En= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the formula confirms our step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each En is of the form (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for E9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nSince 3^{11}=177147, then (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nThat's another way to look at it.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough times now. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each inner expression as \\( E_i \\) where \\( E_1 \\) is the innermost expression and \\( E_9 \\) is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I should start evaluating from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's try to count the innermost part first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Then, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.

Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, so each step involves taking the result from the previous step, multiplying by 3, adding 1. So, it's like a recursive process. Let me check if I did each step correctly.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, after evaluating all the nested parentheses, the innermost expression simplifies all the way up to 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So, after simplifying all the parentheses, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Therefore, the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation because 29524 * 3 seems like it should be straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the breakdown.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has multiple layers, right? Let me count them again to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first inner expression is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers, I think.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me write the structure:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) - that's the first layer\n2. Then inside, another (1 + 3(...)) - second layer\n3. Continuing, each time adding another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working outwards. Wait, actually, the innermost is the last one, which is (1 + 3), and each preceding layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is outside.\n- Then, the first inner is (1 + 3(...))\n- Then, each subsequent is another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers? Or eight?\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, the first layer is 3(...). Then inside, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer. Each time we go in, we add a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" inside:\n\n- After the first 3, we have (1+3(...)), so that's the first inner layer.\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...)), so that's the second.\n- Continuing, each time we have another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(...). Inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is the first inner layer. Then, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1 + 3(...)), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), layer 2.\n\nContinuing:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3(...))\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 9? Because each time we go in, we add a layer. So, if we have nine layers, that means we have eight \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression as a series of nested functions.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's nine layers, each defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, since the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. If I have a_1 to a_9, that's nine layers, right? So, the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nYes, that makes sense because each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a_1. Then, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify one more time by computing a few layers manually.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9 is 29524, and then 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence where each term is given by \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Innermost: \\( (1 + 3) = 4 \\)\n2. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Next layer: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter evaluating all the nested parentheses, the result is 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me try that. Let's start by looking at the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that 4, right? Wait, no, let me see. The next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3). So, if I substitute the innermost part, it becomes 1 + 3*(4). So, 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so now that innermost expression simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer out. So, maybe I can make a table or list of these results as I go outward. Let me try to formalize this. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me call the innermost term a\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\u2080 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Continuing this way, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next, a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Continuing further, a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check how many layers we have here. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Each layer I've computed corresponds to one set. So, starting from a\u2080 up to a\u2089, that's ten terms, but maybe I miscounted. Let me recount the original expression to see how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost: (1+3) is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(...)\" So, from the innermost out, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so I think I miscounted earlier. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, there are nine layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\" So, starting from the innermost, that's nine layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps a\u2080 is the innermost (1+3), and then a\u2081 is the next layer, up to a\u2088, which would be the ninth layer. Then, the outermost 3 is multiplied by a\u2088. Let me try that again.\n\nLet me try to structure this correctly. Let's define a\u2080 as the innermost expression: a\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2081 = 1 + 3*a\u2080 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, after nine layers, the innermost expression becomes 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(a\u2088), so that's 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me double-check my multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting the layers, I thought I had ten layers, but now I'm seeing that a\u2080 is the innermost, and a\u2088 is the ninth layer, so the outermost expression is 3*a\u2088, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, is that the final answer? Let me make sure I didn't make any errors in my computations.\n\nLet me go through each a_i again:\n\na\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check a\u2087 again. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2088: 3*9841. Let's compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each additional layer adds another \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(layer1)) \u2192 layer2\n3. (1 + 3*(layer2)) \u2192 layer3\n4. ... and so on until layer9.\n\nSo, the innermost is layer1, and the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, in my earlier computation, I computed up to a\u2088, which is layer9, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, that makes sense.

    "text": " Maybe it's easier if I label each part to keep track. Let me define each inner expression as a variable. Let's say: Let\u2019s start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's call that A. Then, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3A). Let's call that B. Then, moving out another level, it's (1 + 3B) = C, and so on, until we get to the outermost expression. Wait, but how many levels do we have here? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time it's 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one level. Then each time we go out, it's another level. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by the next level. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then 3 times that, then 1 plus that, then 3 times that, and so on. So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses: each \"1 + 3(\" is an opening. So starting from the first 3, the next is 1 + 3(...). Let's count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...))))))) So, there are 9 layers here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 Then layer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 Then layer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 And so on, up to layer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 Then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 up to L9, then multiply the result by 3. That sounds manageable. Let me try that. Let's start with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to L3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, seems like each layer is getting bigger. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*L9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of steps and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again. L1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f L3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f L4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f L5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f L6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f L7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f L8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f L9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. 2*3=6, write 6. So, 68572? Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the previous step. Let me write it out properly: 29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n2*3=6, write down 6.\n\nSo, putting it together: 6 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 688572? Wait, no, that can't be because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 29524 *3 should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 *3: Let me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8,6? Wait, no, the digits are:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext:5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\nNext:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nNext: the leading digit: 2*3=6.\n\nSo, the result is 6 followed by 8, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. So, 688572? Wait, but 29524 *3 is 88572, not 688572. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 29524 *3 is less than 90,000 *3=270,000. Wait, no, 29524 is about 30,000, so 30,000*3=90,000. So, 29524*3 should be 88,572, which is less than 90,000. Wait, so when I write it out, the digits should be 88,572. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, no carryover.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nFinally, the leading digit: 2*3=6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n\n   *       3\n\n   -----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Yes, that makes sense because 29524*3=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recalculate each layer quickly:\n\nL1:1+3=4\n\nL2:1+3*4=13\n\nL3:1+3*13=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. I think I've done this correctly. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I should assign a variable to each level to make it easier. Let's say that each inner expression is a term that I can compute step by step. Let me try to define each layer as a separate equation. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's denote each level as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost expression, and E9 is the outermost one. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, up to E9, which would be the entire expression. So, if I compute each E from E1 to E9 step by step, I should be able to get the final result. Let's start with E1.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, moving to E2.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, that's 13. Now, E3.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 40. Let's keep going.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original problem is 3 times this entire expression. So, the entire expression is E9, and then we multiply it by 3. Let me make sure I didn't miss that. The original problem is 3*(E9). So, once I compute E9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe breaking it down differently.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, same result. But let me confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in computing E9. Let me go through each step again to verify.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, E9 is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step, which might be faster or confirm the result.\n\nLooking at the expressions, each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for E(n).\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is E(n) = a*E(n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the formula:\n\nE(n) = (E(0) - b/(a - 1)) * a^n + b/(a - 1)\n\nBut wait, in our case, E(1) = 4, E(2) = 13, etc. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, our initial term is E1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, perhaps the formula would be adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the number of terms. Since there are 9 layers, from E1 to E9, each time applying E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). So, perhaps the formula is E(n) = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1, with E(1) = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume E_p(n) = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: E(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the closed-form formula.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Compute 3(1 + 3(...))\", which is 3*E(9). So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation.\n\n3^10: Let's compute it step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Thus, E(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting with E1 = 4. Using the recurrence relation, we find that E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, E(9) = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's start from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))) Hmm, wait, actually, each time I replace the innermost, I have to adjust the next layer. Let me make sure I do this correctly. Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, layer 2: (1 + 3*(layer 1)) = (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So layer 2 is 13. Then, layer 3: (1 + 3*(layer 2)) = (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: (1 + 3*(layer 3)) = (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(layer 4)) = (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(layer 5)) = (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*(layer 6)) = (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*(layer 7)) = (1 + 3*3280). Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*(layer 8)) = (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that multiplication again because 29524*3: 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading it from top: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each time, I took the result of the innermost layer, multiplied it by 3, added 1, and then used that result for the next layer out. After computing all nine layers, the final result inside the outermost parentheses was 29524, and then multiplying that by 3 gave me 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks like all the steps check out. I don't see any mistakes in the arithmetic or the order of operations. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds a certain value, so I can compute each layer one by one. Let me try to compute the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost expression, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can find the value of Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer. Let me try that. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my calculations because this seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's do this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication again: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the 9th layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let's start from the innermost part and work our way out. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. So, starting from the inside, the first step is 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the second layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer gives me 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me keep going. The next layer is 1 + 3*40. So, 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, the fourth layer is 121. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. The fifth layer is 364. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, the sixth layer is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's see, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, the seventh layer is 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. That's the eighth layer. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, the innermost expression worked out to 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that result, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, each layer: 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in the steps. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the very last step where I multiplied by 3 again. So, yeah, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result).

Then, moving one step out, it's 3 times that result: 3 * 4 = 12. Then, adding 1: 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, wait, maybe I should think of each layer as 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to formalize this. Let me define each layer as a_i, where i is the step from the inside. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, so a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.

    "text": " Maybe I should start evaluating from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then work my way out. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part becomes 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3(4). Wait, that's 1 + 3 times 4. So, 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level becomes 13. Hmm, okay, so each time I go out a level, I'm replacing the innermost expression with the result. Let me try to map this out step by step. Let's number the levels from the inside out as levels 1 to 9. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after Level 9, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost level: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Continuing, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. After that, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, each step builds upon the previous one, and by carefully computing each level, I arrive at the final result. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have made this easier. Hmm, looking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication and addition, so it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me think. Each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I denote each level as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating things since there are only 9 levels. But for practice, let me try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple of the intermediate steps using the formula to see if they match. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is what I had before. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula is working as expected. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each level is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving this recurrence, we find that \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the 9th level, \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, let's compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3(4)). Wait, because the innermost was (1 + 3), which is 4, so the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so now we have 40. Moving another layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(40)). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, so now it's 121. Next layer out: (1 + 3*(121)). Compute that: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. So now we have 364. Moving another layer out: (1 + 3*(364)). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Hmm, 1093. Next layer: (1 + 3*(1093)). Compute that: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. So now we have 3280. Next layer out: (1 + 3*(3280)). Let's calculate that: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wow, 9841. Now, moving another layer out: (1 + 3*(9841)). Compute that: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the next layer: (1 + 3*(29524)). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524 is 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(88573). Let's compute that: 3*88573. Hmm, let me do this multiplication step by step. 88573 * 3. Let's break it down: 80,000 * 3 = 240,000; 8,000 * 3 = 24,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 70 * 3 = 210; 3 * 3 = 9. Now, add all those together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So, 3*88573 = 265,719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then each layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573. Then 3*88573 = 265,719. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers from the innermost. In our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count: Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's 1 layer. Then each subsequent parenthesis adds another layer. Let's see, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and I think there are 9 layers in total because each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and the outermost 3* is the final multiplication. Wait, actually, let me check the number of times the expression repeats. The innermost is (1+3), then each time it's wrapped in another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each adding a layer. So, n = 9. Therefore, using the closed-form formula, a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Wait, that's the value before the outermost multiplication by 3. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 265,719. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. Let's see: the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let's count the number of layers by the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\".\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nEach time we add another layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" segments. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer.\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, the first ( is layer 1: (1 + 3(...))\n\nThen each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n\nSo, 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, which means 9 layers. So, using the closed-form, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, earlier when I computed step by step, I ended up with 265,719, which is 3*88573, but according to the closed-form, it should be 3*(29524) = 88572. There's a mismatch here. That suggests I might have made a mistake in my step-by-step computation. Let me check my step-by-step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, so there are 10 layers? Because I started counting from 1 to 10. But according to the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n10. (1+3(\n\nWait, actually, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer, so there are 9 layers because the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent is another layer up to layer 9. But in my step-by-step, I ended up with 10 layers because I started counting from (1+3) as layer 1, then each subsequent as layer 2, etc., up to layer 10. So, that suggests that the number of layers is actually 9, but my step-by-step went up to layer 10. Therefore, the confusion arises from whether the innermost is layer 1 or layer 0. Let's clarify.\n\nIf I consider the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds 1. So, the number of layers is 9, which would correspond to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I computed up to (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, that suggests that I considered the innermost as layer 1, and then each subsequent layer up to layer 10, which would mean 10 layers. Therefore, the confusion is in the indexing.\n\nSo, to resolve this, let's define the layers properly. Let me define a_1 as the innermost expression: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I went up to a_10 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, that suggests that I considered the outermost layer as a_10, but in reality, the expression only has 9 layers, so a_9 = 29524, and the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought I had 9 layers, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 10 layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3.\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n10. (1+3(\n\nWait, actually, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, but the innermost is (1+3), which doesn't have a \"1+3(\" after it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" segments, which is 9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, ..., a_9 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, which would be a_10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, I think I added an extra layer by mistake. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nThe innermost is (1+3(1+3)), but wait, no, the innermost is (1+3). Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: (1 + 3*(Layer 9)) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nBut wait, the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3. So, perhaps I miscounted. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" segments.\n\nStarting from the first ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n\nSo, 9 layers. Each of these layers corresponds to a_i, where i goes from 1 to 9. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 9: (1 + 3*a_8) = a_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in my step-by-step, I computed up to a_10 = 88573, which is incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers. Therefore, the correct computation should stop at a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers because I started counting from (1+3) as layer 1, and each subsequent as layer 2, etc., up to layer 10. But in reality, the original expression has 9 layers after the initial 3. So, perhaps the confusion is in whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. The initial 3 is multiplied by the entire expression, which has 9 layers. Therefore, the correct total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the closed-form formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I ended up with 265,719, which is 3*88573. So, I think I added an extra layer by mistake. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds an opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n- The first ( after 3: layer 1\n- The second ( after that: layer 2\n- ...\n- The ninth ( after that: layer 9\n\nSo, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I added an extra layer, computing up to layer 10, which doesn't exist in the original expression. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this because I'm getting conflicting results between the closed-form and the step-by-step. The closed-form suggests that a_9 = 29524, so 3*a_9 = 88572. But in my step-by-step, I computed up to layer 10 as 88573, which would be a_10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me parse the original expression again to make sure.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3(\n\nWait, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then, each subsequent is another layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is layer 1, and there are 9 layers in total. Therefore, the correct computation is up to layer 9, which is a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the layers, adding an extra one. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the closed-form formula again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut I'm confused because earlier I thought I had 10 layers, but it's actually 9. So, to make sure, let me write out the expression with the layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nSo, after layer 9, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I computed step-by-step, I went up to (1 + 3*29524) = 88573, which is incorrect because that would imply 10 layers, but the original expression only has 9 layers. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was wrong because I added an extra layer.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to layer 9, resulting in 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. It says: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nStarting after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer up to layer 9: a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, but now I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just verify with another approach. Maybe using the closed-form formula directly.\n\nWe have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. So, starting from Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving to Level 2, which would be 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, Level 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Level 2 is 13. Level 3 would then be 1 + 3(Level 2). Substituting Level 2's value: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Level 3 is 40. Continuing this way, Level 4 is 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5 is 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Level 5 is 364. Level 6 is 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7 is 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8 is 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, Level 9 is the outermost expression: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; So 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, after carefully computing each level step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? So, let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). Computing that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, that layer is 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that: 3*364. Let me calculate that. 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3=12, so 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that. 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093=3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, that layer is 3280. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. Well, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280=9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, that layer simplifies to 9841. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, that layer is 29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Adding 1 gives 88573. So, that layer is 88573. Now, moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9.

Now, finally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*265720. Let me compute that. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60.

So, if I compute each level step by step, starting from Level 1 and moving outward, I can find the value at each level and build up to the final answer. That seems manageable. Let me try to compute each level one by one. Starting with Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Level 1 equals 4. Now, moving on to Level 2: Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Level 2 is 13. Next, Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.

Level 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3(Level 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me break it down: 29524 * 3. Let's do 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6.

Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

So, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expression step by step again, maybe using a different approach or verifying each multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each level seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define each level as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more using the formula. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. We denote each nested part as follows:\n\n- Level 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Level 2: \\(1 + 3(\\text{Level 1})\\)\n- Level 3: \\(1 + 3(\\text{Level 2})\\)\n- ...\n- Level 9: \\(1 + 3(\\text{Level 8})\\)\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Level 9}\\):\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to work through this step by step. Let's label each layer from the inside out for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows: Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then we multiply that result by 3. Hmm, maybe that's a good approach. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Well, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that right. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that result. So, moving one layer out, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))) Wait, no, that might not be the right way to look at it. Let me approach it more methodically. Let me denote each layer as follows: Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me number the layers from the inside out as layer 1 to layer 9. So layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 layer 2: 3*(layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Then layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 and moving outward to layer 9. That sounds manageable. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe 29524 * 3 can be broken down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps because that's where errors often occur.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can compute each layer step by step as I did before.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find D, we can set the recurrence equal to a steady-state value. Let me assume L_n = L_{n-1} = D.\n\nSo, D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because L_1 corresponds to n=1, so L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since I was working it out step by step, it was a good exercise.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly enough. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe each layer is built by multiplying the inner expression by 3 and adding 3 again? Hmm, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let's try that. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, with 1 being the innermost. So layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, let's compute each layer one by one. Starting with layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So layer 2 is 13. Moving on to layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the large numbers.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Let me check 3*364: 364*3, 4*3=12, 6*3=18 (plus 1 carried over is 19), 3*3=9 (plus 1 carried over is 10). So, 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1093*3, 3*3=9, 9*3=27 (carryover 2), 0*3=0 +2=2, 1*3=3. So 3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, total 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. That seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds a certain value, and I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to compute the innermost part first. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Now, moving one layer out, the next innermost expression is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. So, 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. So now, replacing that part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) Hmm, okay, so the next layer out is (1 + 3(13)). Let's compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So now, replacing that, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) Moving outward again, the next part is (1 + 3(40)). Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. So, replacing that, we have: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) Wait, let me check that. So, the expression now is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))) Hmm, okay, next layer: (1 + 3(121)). So, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Replacing that, we get: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))). Now, the next part is (1 + 3(364)). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))). Next, compute (1 + 3(1093)). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, now the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))). Moving outward, compute (1 + 3(3280)). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, replacing that, we have: 3(1 + 3(9841)). Now, compute (1 + 3(9841)). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, now the expression is: 3(29524). Finally, compute that: 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4, then (1+3*4)=13, then (1+3*13)=40, then (1+3*40)=121, then (1+3*121)=364, then (1+3*364)=1093, then (1+3*1093)=3280, then (1+3*3280)=9841, then (1+3*9841)=29524, and finally 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Each step, I multiplied the inner result by 3 and added 1, except for the last step where I just multiplied by 3. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part and then work my way outwards. Let me try that. Let's label each part for clarity. Let me denote each innermost expression as E1, then moving outward as E2, E3, and so on up to E9, where E9 is the outermost expression. So, E1 = 1 + 3 Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 E4 = 1 + 3*E3 ... and so on, until E9, which would be the entire expression. Wait, but the problem is 3 times the entire expression, so maybe I need to adjust that. Let me think again. The entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*E8, and E8 is 1 + 3*E7, etc. So, each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1), starting from E1 = 1 + 3. Let me start calculating each Ei step by step.

So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating E9. Let me go through E1 to E9 again to verify each step. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct).

    "text": " Maybe I should start solving from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me try to substitute each inner expression step by step. Let's define each part as a step. Let me label each level from the innermost to the outermost as Step 1 to Step 9. So, starting with Step 1: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, that expression is part of another 1 + 3(...). So, Step 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1 result). Step 1 was 4, so 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next, Step 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2 result). Step 2 was 13, so 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Step 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3 result). Step 3 was 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Step 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4 result). Step 4 was 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Step 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5 result). Step 5 was 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Step 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6 result). Step 6 was 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Step 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7 result). Step 7 was 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Finally, Step 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8 result). Step 8 was 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute this: 3*9841. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down. 9841 times 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this Step 9 result. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Again, breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try another approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here. Wait, I notice that each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric series or something that could be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's say that each step n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 levels of nesting, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Step 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation. So, this method confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level of the expression follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By calculating each step sequentially, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent level builds on this result. After computing all nine levels, we find the innermost result to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer becomes 13. Then, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that layer is 40. Let's keep going. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. That's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, so that's 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's see, 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. That's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. So that layer is 3280. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's 29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.

Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So 3*29,524 = 88,572. Then, adding 1: 1 + 88,572 = 88,573. So that layer is 88,573. Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(88,573). Let's compute 3*88,573. Let me break it down: 80,000*3 is 240,000; 8,000*3 is 24,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 70*3 is 210; 3*3 is 9. So adding them up: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000; 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500; 265,500 + 210 = 265,710; 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. So 3*88,573 is 265,719. Then, adding 1: 1 + 265,719 = 265,720. That's 265,720. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(265,720). Let's compute 3*265,720. Let's see, 200,000*3 is 600,000; 60,000*3 is 180,000; 5,000*3 is 15,000; 700*3 is 2,100; 20*3 is 60. So adding them up: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. So 3*265,720 is 797,160. Then, adding 1: 1 + 797,160 = 797,161. That's 797,161. Finally, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(result). So 3*797,161. Let me compute that. 700,000*3 is 2,100,000; 90,000*3 is 270,000; 7,000*3 is 21,000; 100*3 is 300; 60*3 is 180; 1*3 is 3. Now, adding them all together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483. So 3*797,161 is 2,391,483. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications or additions. It's easy to slip up with large numbers, so I want to double-check each step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4, correct. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Next, 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Next, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Next, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Next, 1 + 3*29524 = 88,573, correct. Then, 1 + 3*88,573 = 265,720, correct. Next, 1 + 3*265,720 = 797,161, correct. Finally, 3*797,161 = 2,391,483, correct. So, each step seems to check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 2,391,483.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to parse it step by step. Let's denote the innermost expression first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 12). Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. Then, again, moving out, we multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39. Next layer is (1 + 39): 1 + 39 = 40. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120. Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363. Next layer: (1 + 363) = 364. Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092. Next layer: (1 + 1092) = 1093. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279. Next layer: (1 + 3279) = 3280. Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840. Wait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again because I'm not sure if I did that correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time we have a layer of (1 + 3*(previous result)). Let me try to list each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Next: 3 * 13 = 39\n5. Next: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Next: 3 * 40 = 120\n7. Next: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Next: 3 * 121 = 363\n9. Next: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Next: 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. Next: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Next: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. Next: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Next: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n\nWait, but that seems like 14 steps, but the original expression only has 9 layers after the initial 3(...). Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards. Let me list each step with the correct number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, each layer is (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, perhaps I should think of each layer as (1 + 3*previous_result). Let me try again, but this time, keeping track of each layer properly. Let me number the layers from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when I computed Layer 8, I got 9841, then Layer 9 would be (1 + 3*9841) which is 1 + 29523 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was listing the layers, I had 14 steps, but perhaps that's because I was counting each multiplication and addition separately. Let me check again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 3*(1 + 3*Layer1). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me look at the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, perhaps I should structure it as:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 36084, the entire expression is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of it as 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 was 29524, I got 88572, but now I'm getting a different result. So, I must have messed up the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify how the layers are structured. Let me write out the entire expression step by step, ensuring I get each layer correctly.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet me define E(n) as the expression starting from the nth layer.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is E(9) = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, E(8) = 1 + 3*E(9)\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*E(8)\n\nAnd so on, up to E(1) = 1 + 3*E(2)\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is 3*E(1). So, let me compute each E(n) starting from E(9):\n\nE(9) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE(8) = 1 + 3*E(9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*E(8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE(6) = 1 + 3*E(7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE(5) = 1 + 3*E(6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE(4) = 1 + 3*E(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE(2) = 1 + 3*E(3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE(1) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E(1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried a different approach, I got 108252. So, which one is correct? Let me check the steps again.\n\nIn this approach, E(9) is 4, then E(8)=13, E(7)=40, E(6)=121, E(5)=364, E(4)=1093, E(3)=3280, E(2)=9841, E(1)=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I thought that each layer was 3*(1 + previous), but perhaps that's where I went wrong. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(E), where E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, E is 1 + 3*E', where E' is the next layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, E9 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen E8 = 1 + 3*E9\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*E1.\n\nSo, according to this, E9=4, E8=13, E7=40, E6=121, E5=364, E4=1093, E3=3280, E2=9841, E1=29524.\n\nThus, the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried a different approach, I thought of each layer as being 3*(1 + previous), which might have been incorrect. Let me verify with a smaller example to see which approach is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a simpler version: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext layer: 1 + 15 = 16\n\nNext layer: 3*16 = 48\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*48 = 144.\n\nWait, but according to the E(n) approach:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nEntire expression: 3*40 = 120.\n\nBut when I computed step by step, I got 144, which is different. So, there's a discrepancy here. Therefore, my E(n) approach must be incorrect.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me compute the smaller example again.\n\nGiven: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, moving out: 3*(13) = 39\n\nThen, entire expression: 3*(13) = 39? Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 3*(13) = 39\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(13) = 39? Wait, no, that's not correct because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nWait, no, let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe expression is 3*(A), where A = 1 + 3*(B), where B = 1 + 3*(C), where C = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, C = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nB = 1 + 3*C = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA = 1 + 3*B = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nEntire expression: 3*A = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought of computing it step by step, I thought of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nSo, the correct result is 120, not 144 as I previously thought. So, my initial approach was correct, and the E(n) approach gives the right answer.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of the layers as E1 to E9, I got 88572, but when I tried a different approach, I thought of 3*(Layer9) as 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I tried the alternative approach earlier, I thought of each layer as 3*(1 + previous), which gave me a different result, but that must have been incorrect.\n\nSo, to confirm, using the smaller example, the correct approach is to compute each E(n) as 1 + 3*E(n+1), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, in the original problem, computing up to E1=29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that with the smaller example. In the smaller example, we had E3=4, E2=13, E1=40, and the entire expression is 3*40=120, which matches.\n\nSo, in the original problem, after computing E1=29524, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of each layer as 3*(1 + previous), I got a different result, but that approach was flawed. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify again with another small example to be sure.\n\nConsider 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nAs before, the correct result is 120.\n\nBut if I compute it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nEntire expression: 3*121 = 363.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, which has 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 times.\n\nYes, so 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, E9=4, E8=13, E7=40, E6=121, E5=364, E4=1093, E3=3280, E2=9841, E1=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that E(n) was 1 + 3*E(n+1), so E1=1 + 3*E2, and so on, with E9=4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each step again:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nEntire expression: 3*E1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Maybe I can evaluate each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me try to map this out. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. Wait, actually, since it's nested, Level 1 would be the innermost, and Level 9 would be the outermost. So, starting from Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3. Then Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1). Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2). And so on, up to Level 9. So, perhaps I can compute each level step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9). So, after computing Level 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me check that.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nHmm, 29524 * 3. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3 is the same as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Did I count the levels correctly? The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many levels? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 instances of (1+3(...)). Wait, actually, each time you have a (1+3(...)), which itself contains another one, so maybe the number of levels is 9. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the innermost is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 levels. So, my initial approach was correct, with Level 1 being (1+3), and Level 9 being the outermost (1+3*(...)), then multiplied by 3.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in adding or multiplying somewhere.\n\nStarting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12; total 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step is to multiply Level 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check each multiplication again, because sometimes when numbers get large, it's easy to make an error.\n\nLet me compute Level 9 again: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carryover 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so let's compute it properly:\n\n9841\n*    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write 9, carryover 2.\n\nSince there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841 * 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels, let me recount how many levels there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nEach additional layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost as Level 1, each outer layer is Level 2, Level 3, etc. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is the start of Level 1. Then each subsequent ( starts a new level. Let me count the number of ( after 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me see:\n\n- 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 Level 1\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...)) \u2192 Level 2\n- Continuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is Level 1, and each time you go out, you add a Level. So, the number of Levels is equal to the number of times (1+3) is nested. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new level. Let me count the number of (:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 levels. So, Level 1 is the innermost, Level 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...) segments:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3(...) is a new level.\n\nSo, let's list them:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 Level 9\n2. Inside that: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 Level 8\n3. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Level 7\n4. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Level 6\n5. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Level 5\n6. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Level 4\n7. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Level 3\n8. Then: (1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Level 2\n9. Finally: (1+3)))))) \u2192 Level 1\n\nWait, that's 9 levels, from Level 1 to Level 9, as I thought earlier. So, each time I computed Level 1 through Level 9 correctly, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a formula, especially if they're finite. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this.\n\nLet me denote the expression as E(n), where n is the number of levels. So, E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE(4) = 1 + 3*E(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE(5) = 1 + 3*E(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE(6) = 1 + 3*E(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*E(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE(8) = 1 + 3*E(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE(9) = 1 + 3*E(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculations. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for a finite nested expression like E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4, the closed-form solution can be found using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see if I can derive that.\n\nThe recursive formula is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found as follows.\n\nFirst, let's write out the first few terms:\n\nE(1) = 4.\n\nE(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence is E(n) = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's test for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but E(1) is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.\n\nThe recurrence is E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1, with E(1)=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E(n) = 3*E(n-1), which has the solution E_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition E(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nE(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so E(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E(9) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 3^{10} to make sure.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, so 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nThen, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, E(9) = 29524, and 3*E(9) = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly. Each step seems correct, and the formula confirms the result. So, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each level up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated 9 times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each level from the innermost outward**:\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first. Let's see, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level out is 13. Now, moving another level out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next level is 40. Hmm, this seems like each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me check that again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then, next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Wait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct. Let me try another level to see if there's a pattern. Next, 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, 121. So, the next level is 121. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Wait, 3*120 is 360, so 3*121 is 363, right? Yes, so 363 + 1 is 364. So, the next level is 364. Next, 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that. 3*364: Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that level is 1093. Next, moving out, 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that level is 3280. Next, moving out another level: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that level is 9841. Next, moving out another level: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that level is 29524. Now, moving out to the next level: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that level is 88573. Finally, moving out to the outermost level, we have 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, that's 11 steps, but the original expression had nine nested parentheses. Let me count the number of times I did the 1 + 3*(...) step. Starting from the innermost, which is the first (1 + 3), then each step out adds another. So, starting from the innermost, I think I did 9 steps of 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the outermost is 3*(result). So, maybe I should recount.\n\nLet me list each step with the level:\n\n- Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n- Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n- Level 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n- Level 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n- Level 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n- Level 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n- Level 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n- Level 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n- Level 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n- Level 10: 3*(29524) = 88572? Wait, no, because the outermost expression is 3*(...), so after Level 9, which is 29524, the next step is 3*(29524) = 88572, but then the problem is 3*(1 + ...), so maybe I missed a step.\n\nWait, let me look back at the original expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, after the innermost, which is 9 levels deep, the 10th level would be 3*(result). Wait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to Level 10 as 3*(29524) = 88572, but that's not correct because the outermost is 3*(Level 9 result). Let me correct this.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first innermost part. Let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections. Each time you go out a level, you add another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Level 10: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9). So, perhaps I went one step too far. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Level 9, which is 29524, the outermost is 3*(29524) = 88572. But that can't be right because when I computed earlier, I ended up with 265719. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of levels.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount how many times I apply the 1 + 3*(...) operation. Let me see. The original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first. Then each time you go out, you add another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I have 9 levels of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(result of the 9th level). Let me try that.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9 result) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought I had 10 levels, I ended up with 265719, which seems way too high. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is at the end, and moving outward, each time you have a (1 + 3*(...)), so how many times does that happen?\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1: 4\n\nThen, moving out, each time you have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each step out adds another level.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, that would mean 9 levels of 1 + 3*(...) and then 1 level of 3*(...). So, in total, 10 operations, but perhaps the initial 3 is the 10th operation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as starting with the innermost and working outwards, each time substituting the inner expression with its value. So, let me try that approach.\n\nLet me list each substitution step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level out: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought I ended up with 265719, but that must have been a miscalculation. Wait, let me check the last step again.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265719, which seems way off. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1: 4\n\nThen, moving out, each time you have 1 + 3*(...), so:\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 265719, I must have gone one level too deep. Let me check that again. Perhaps I miscounted the levels. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, each time we have an expression of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the coefficient. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but perhaps it's easier to recognize the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can write out the terms and see if there's a pattern.\n\nWe have:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nB - 3*B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265719, which was incorrect. It seems that I made a mistake in the number of levels, perhaps adding an extra level or miscalculating the multiplication.\n\nTo be thorough, let me compute each step again:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Level 10: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought I had 265719, which was wrong. It seems I must have miscounted the levels or made a multiplication error. But now, after carefully stepping through each level and verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous level)}\\), and the final step multiplies the result by 3. Using the derived formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\) for the nth level, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent level follows the pattern until the outermost level, which is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start evaluating from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let's try that. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th one: 9th: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out one level, the 8th parenthesis would be 1 + 3*(result from 9th). So, 8th: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, the 7th parenthesis would be 1 + 3*(result from 8th). So, 7th: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Continuing this way, the 6th would be 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 5th: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, 4th: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, 3rd: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Moving on, the 2nd: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, the outermost, the 1st: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, I take 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Breaking it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nThen, 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nNext, 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nThen, 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the innermost calculations because if any of those were wrong, the whole result would be off. Let me go through each step again:\n\n9th: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n8th: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n7th: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n6th: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5th: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n4th: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n3rd: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n2nd: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n1st: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large, and sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me verify the multiplication another way. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Calculating each part:\n\n20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Okay, that confirms the earlier result. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using a different approach. Let me consider that each term is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next inner expression. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). This seems like a geometric series or something that might have a formula. Let me think about it. If I have a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term, and it's nested 9 times, maybe there's a pattern or formula to compute it without expanding each step. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3 =1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40. a_4=1 + 3*a_3=1 + 120=121. a_5=1 + 3*a_4=1 + 363=364. a_6=1 + 3*a_5=1 + 1092=1093. a_7=1 + 3*a_6=1 + 3279=3280. a_8=1 + 3*a_7=1 + 9840=9841. a_9=1 + 3*a_8=1 + 29523=29524. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional constant, which is a bit unexpected given that all the a_n are integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard solution method involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)}=C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n= C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4= C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by expanding step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked it, both by expanding each step and by using a recurrence relation approach. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't think I made a mistake.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me try that. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next expression is 1 + 3*40. Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that layer is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*364. Let me do that multiplication first: 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so adding those together gives 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so adding those gives 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. That's the next layer. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, and 3*280 is 840, so adding those together gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that layer is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's the next layer. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that layer is 88573. Finally, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. Let's break it down: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, the innermost expression worked out to 265720. Now, going back to the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by this entire result. So, the entire expression is 3*(265720). Let me compute that. 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that multiplication because 3*265720 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute 265720*3 digit by digit. Let's do that to make sure. 265720 multiplied by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n0*3 = 0\n2*3 = 6\n7*3 = 21, write down 1 and carry over 2\n5*3 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1\n6*3 = 18, plus the carried 1 is 19, write down 9 and carry over 1\n5*3 = 15, plus the carried 1 is 16, write down 6 and carry over 1\n2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\nSo, writing it all together from left to right: 7, 6, 9, 7, 1, 6, 0. So, that's 797160. Okay, so that's correct. So, the final result is 797160.\n\nWait a second, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me go back and check each step because the final result seems a bit high, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nWait, that's 11 layers, but the original expression only has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is the 9th one, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, when I worked through the layers, I did 11 steps, which might be incorrect. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, so after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, meaning we should have 9 computations. But in my earlier steps, I went up to 11 layers. That suggests I might have overcounted.\n\nLet me try again, carefully counting each layer. Let's list each layer from the innermost to the outermost, with layer 1 being the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\nCompute 3*20000 = 60000\n3*9000 = 27000\n3*500 = 1500\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's 88572. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the innermost layer was 4, and each layer built up to 265720, but that was because I miscounted the layers. Actually, the original expression has 9 layers, so the outermost computation is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering two extra layers beyond the 9. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the process is:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation where I thought the innermost layer was 4 and ended up with 265720. But that was because I miscounted the layers. So, actually, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by recalculating each layer carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the result was 797160, which was due to an overcounting of layers. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've got it right this time. I just need to be careful about the number of layers and not overcount them. Initially, I thought there were 11 layers, but actually, there are only 9, which changes the final result significantly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with repeated patterns. By recognizing the recurrence relation and using a formula, we find the result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer from the inside.

    "text": " Maybe each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me try to evaluate it step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let's denote each layer as follows for clarity: Let me assign variables to each layer to make it easier. Let's say: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a systematic way to approach it. Let me try that. Let's compute each layer one by one, starting from Layer 1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step involves multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series? Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Maybe I can model this as a geometric sequence or find a closed-form formula. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, setting equal to left-hand side: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's see, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So, starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one level out, that part becomes 3(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, it's 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). Let me clarify. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, let me define this recursively. Let me denote each level as a term, starting from the innermost as level 1. So, level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, level 2: 1 + 3*(level 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*(level 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(level 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(level 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, correct. Then, 1 + 3*4=13, correct. 1 + 3*13=40, yes. 1 + 3*40=121, correct. 1 + 3*121=364, right. 1 + 3*364=1093, yes. 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. 1 + 3*3280=9841, yes. 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each level is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same result, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first. Let me see, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Let me confirm: starting from the very end, it's 1 + 3, then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on. So, perhaps if I work from the inside out, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as follows for clarity:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n...  \nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems right. So, I can compute each layer one by one, starting from Layer 1 and moving up to Layer 9. Let me write this down systematically. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So plugging in Layer 1's value: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Next, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3. Let me do that step by step. 100*3 is 300, 20*3 is 60, 1*3 is 3. So 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, add 1: 363 + 1 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Breaking it down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 1, 8, 5, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try that again more carefully. Maybe I should write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 0 (since we're done with digits) is 27. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the 2, we have 9, 5, 2, 4. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u21925, carry 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0\nSo the result is 88572. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3\u00d74=13. Layer3:1+3\u00d713=40. Layer4:1+3\u00d740=121. Layer5:1+3\u00d7121=364. Layer6:1+3\u00d7364=1093. Layer7:1+3\u00d71093=3280. Layer8:1+3\u00d73280=9841. Layer9:1+3\u00d79841=29524. Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can recognize here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more efficiently using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K =1 \u2192 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was a nested expression with 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value of 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a closed-form formula, which also gave me the same result.

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let's see, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first. Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next part is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. Step 2: Compute 1 + 3*(4). Well, 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that part simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that. Step 3: Compute 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that simplifies to 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me check if this pattern holds for the next level. Step 4: Compute 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Okay, so far, so good. Let me write down these results to keep track: Innermost: 4, then 13, 40, 121... Wait a second, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121... Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Each step seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, if I denote each level as a term in a sequence, say a_n, where n is the level, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, and so on. So, the recursive formula would be a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That seems right. So, maybe I can model this as a recursive sequence and find a general formula for a_n. Let me think about how to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard method to solve such equations is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula seems to hold. So, each level n corresponds to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many levels do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's level 1, then moving out, each subsequent 1 + 3(...) is another level. Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) \u2192 level 1\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(level 1) \u2192 level 2\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(level 2) \u2192 level 3\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(level 3) \u2192 level 4\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(level 4) \u2192 level 5\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(level 5) \u2192 level 6\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(level 6) \u2192 level 7\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(level 7) \u2192 level 8\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(level 8) \u2192 level 9\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(level 9)\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is level 1, and each subsequent layer adds another level, so from the innermost to the outermost, we have 9 levels of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9, right? Because each time we add a layer, we increase the level by 1, starting from 1. So, if we have 9 layers, that would be level 9. Therefore, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost parentheses correspond to level 9. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. So, a_9 is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 29000 + 524. So, 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 =88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLevel 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLevel 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLevel 6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLevel 7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLevel 8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLevel 9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Okay, so that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that matches. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each level step by step without using the formula, just to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nLevel 2:1 + 3*4=1 +12=13.\n\nLevel 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLevel 4:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLevel 5:1 + 3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLevel 6:1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLevel 7:1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLevel 8:1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLevel 9:1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each level was 1 + 3*(previous level). By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, I was able to compute the value without having to manually calculate each level, which would have been time-consuming, especially for more levels. However, since the number of levels here is manageable, computing each step manually also worked fine. It's a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recursive formulas.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider that each time you go one level out, you're effectively tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and an additive constant of 1 at each step. The formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, neatly encapsulates this growth. It's interesting how exponential growth can lead to such large numbers so quickly.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to represent this expression using a different mathematical notation, maybe a summation or product, but I think the recursive approach is the most straightforward here. It's a good example of how recognizing a pattern can simplify a seemingly complex problem.\n\nIn summary, by methodically working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the recursive pattern, I was able to compute the value of the given expression step by step. The key was identifying that each level follows a specific recurrence relation and then applying the appropriate formula to find the nth term. This approach avoids the tedium of manual computation and provides a clear path to the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we can compute the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recursive sequence where each term is thrice the previous term plus one.\n\n2. **Find the general formula**: The nth term of the sequence can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Determine the number of levels**: The expression has 9 levels of nesting, so we use n = 9.\n\n4. **Compute the 9th term**:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the 9th term.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**:  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that approach. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). So, substituting the 4 in, it becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level is 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we have 40. Continuing this way, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Hmm, so that's 121. Next layer out: 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121 first: 121*3 is 363, then adding 1 gives 364. So, now we have 364. Moving out another level: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3 is... let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, now we have 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, now we have 29524. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, now we have 265720. Finally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*265720. Let me compute that: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 797,160. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, each step: 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573, 1+3*88573=265720. Then, 3*265720=797160. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and the multiplication and addition steps check out. So, I think the final answer is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner expression. Following this method step by step leads to the final result of 797,160.\n\n$\\boxed{797160}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should start by solving the innermost part and then work my way out. Let me try to parse this step by step. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the last part before the first closing parenthesis. So, let me start there. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, but each step is 1 + 3*(something), so actually, each step involves multiplying by 3 and then adding 1. Hmm, that might form a pattern or a sequence. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, actually, when I count the number of parentheses, each opening has a closing, so maybe it's 9 layers? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So starting from the first 3, then the first (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. Let me count: the first 3 is outside, then each (1 + 3(...)) adds a layer, and I can see that there are 8 layers inside the first one. Wait, let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd this goes on until Layer 9, because the expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count again: Each time you have a (1 + 3(...)), so the first (1 + 3) is the innermost, then each time you go out, you add another (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, you have 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, 9 layers in total. Therefore, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, starting from the innermost. Let me write each layer's value step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the 9 layers. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Starting from the innermost, each (1+3(...)) adds a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time we add another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after the 3, each ( adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3(...))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers? Or 10? Wait, no, the first ( after the 3 is the first layer, then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count the number of ( in the expression:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of (:\n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after the first 1+3\n3. ( after the second 1+3\n...\nWait, no, actually, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(... So, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. ( after the first 3\n2. ( after the first 1+3\n3. ( after the second 1+3\n...\nContinuing until the ninth (, because each time you have a (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, because starting from the first ( after the initial 3, each ( adds a layer, and the innermost is the ninth. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier calculation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, resulting in Layer 9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when I'm dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to write down each layer with their corresponding expressions.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer is built upon the previous one, and each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the calculations.\n\nLet me recompute a few layers to check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 363. 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Total 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute it as 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
