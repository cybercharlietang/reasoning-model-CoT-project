    "text": " So, there are nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's label each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. So, layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result of layer 1), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the innermost part is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each step as I go. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 result is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 result is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1000 first, which is 3000, then 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 result is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. So adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Wait, let me check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4/2) -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with each inner expression being similar. But since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified with both step-by-step computation and the formula, I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. \n\nWe derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\nFor the outermost layer (n=9), we calculate:\n\n\\[a_9 = \\frac{3^{10}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = 29524\\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this nesting. That means I need to compute the innermost one first and then work my way out. Let me start by numbering each parenthesis from the innermost to the outermost. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(result of 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(result of 2)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of times the expression 1 + 3(...) appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the ninth one.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and that continues until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), etc., up to layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, but let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted. Let me try again. Each time I add another layer, I add another 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then, each time we go out one, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, inside the outermost 3*(...), there are eight more 1 + 3*(...) expressions. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*. Let me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3*(...), inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...), which is the next layer. Each time we go in, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the outermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(...)\n\nInside that:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(...)\n\nInside Layer 2:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(...)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: 1 + 3\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers, with the innermost being Layer 9: 1 + 3. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, up to Layer 1, which is the outermost 3*(Layer 2). So, I need to compute Layer 9 first, then Layer 8, up to Layer 1, which is the final answer.\n\nLet me start by computing Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's easy.\n\nNow, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841 = Let's compute that.\n\nWait, so Layer 1 is the outermost layer, which is 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 2 is 9841, so 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*800 = 2400\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, Layer 1 is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. I think I might have miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many 1+3 are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach time we have a (1+3(...)), so let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), that's one.\n\nThen, each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, from the innermost, each step adds a layer until we reach the outermost.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...), which is 8 times inside the outermost 3*(...). Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer inside. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time we have a new (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3*(...), inside that is 1 + 3*(...), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 8.\n\nWait, so actually, there are 8 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), making a total of 9 layers including the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), which is layer 1, and inside that, we have 8 more layers, so total layers are 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had layers 1 through 9, with layer 9 being the innermost. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but when I computed, layer 1 was the outermost, which was 3*(layer 2), and layer 2 was 1 + 3*(layer 3), etc., down to layer 9 being 1 + 3.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1, then L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\n...\n\nUp to L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I started from the innermost as layer 9, but perhaps it's better to index from the innermost as layer 1.\n\nWait, maybe I should redefine the layers to avoid confusion. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define L_1 as the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier calculation. Wait, now I'm confused. In my first approach, I had the outermost layer as 3*(L_2), where L_2 was 9841, leading to 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut in this second approach, I'm defining L_1 as the innermost, and then going up to L_9, which is 29524, and then the outermost expression is 3*(L_9), which would be 3*29524 = 88572, which is way larger than before.\n\nBut that can't be right because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3, so I think I'm misdefining the layers here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how I'm indexing the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is 8 inside the outermost 3*(...), making a total of 9 layers including the outermost.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\n\nWhich seems correct, leading to Layer 1 being 3*(Layer 2) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut in the second approach, I started with L_1 as the innermost, leading to L_9 being 29524, and then the outermost expression would be 3*(L_9) = 88572, which contradicts the first approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the second approach, I'm including the outermost 3*(...) as L_9, but that's not the case. Let me think.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, we have 8 more layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so total layers inside the outermost 3*(...) are 8, making a total of 9 layers if we count from the innermost.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of it as having 9 layers inside the 3*(...). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, we have 8 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so the total number of layers is 8 inside the 3*(...), making the total layers from the innermost to the outermost as 9, including the 3*(...) as the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to list each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost layer (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought the outermost was 3*(Layer 2) = 29523.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial layering. Let me check the structure again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 1.\n\nWait, no, if I define Layer 1 as the outermost, then Layer 1 = 3*(Layer 2), where Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3), and so on, until Layer 9 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, in this case, Layer 9 is the innermost, and Layer 1 is the outermost.\n\nSo, computing:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but in my second approach, I was mistakenly including the outermost 3*(...) as part of the layers, which led to confusion. So, the correct way is to have Layer 1 as the outermost 3*(...), and Layer 9 as the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is as follows:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nSo, the final answer is 29523.\n\nI think that's consistent now. To make sure, let me try to compute the layers again step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3.

It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but as long as I'm careful with each multiplication and addition, I can avoid mistakes. I also had to make sure I was correctly identifying which layer was which, to prevent confusion in the numbering. Once I realized that the outermost layer is Layer 1 and the innermost is Layer 9, everything fell into place.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression).

    "text": " So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3), and then working my way outwards. Let me assign each level a number to keep track. Let's say the innermost is Level 1, then the next one out is Level 2, and so on, up to Level 9. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, each level is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So maybe I can compute each level step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Level 1: 4 Now, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). The inner part here would be the result from Level 1, which is 4. So, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's Level 2. Now, moving out another level, Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3 is 40. Next, Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4 is 121. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each level is 1 plus three times the previous level. Let me check if this pattern continues. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, and 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, and 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Now, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, and 41*3 is 123. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524. Now, remember that the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9, because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then each level was computed as 1 + 3*(previous level). Let me verify a few of those steps. Level 1: 4, correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all adds up.

    "text": " So, maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost part first. Let me label each part for clarity. Let's denote the innermost expression as A1: A1 = 1 + 3 Then, the next one out would be A2 = 1 + 3*A1, then A3 = 1 + 3*A2, and so on, until A9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*A9. Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times (something). So, perhaps I should start from the innermost and work my way out, each time computing the next level. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: A1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one level out, A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so A2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, A3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so A3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so A3 is 40. Moving out another level, A4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so A4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, A4 is 121. Next, A5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so A5 = 1 + 363 = 364. A5 is 364. Then, A6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, A6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. A6 is 1093. Next, A7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Thus, A7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. A7 is 3280. Moving out another level, A8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, A8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. A8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost expression, A9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, A9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, A9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times A9, which is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do that:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n------\nLet me compute digit by digit from right to left:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73. 29000\u00d73 = 87000, and 524\u00d73 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me recount each A1 through A9 to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nA1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine levels. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, each level is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when we set a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula, a9 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By iteratively computing each level, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that part, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Let's compute that. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12. Then, adding 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that. 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer becomes 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Let me try to write this down step by step to keep track.

From the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 1 + 3, that's one. Then each next one adds another. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first inner is (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then each subsequent is another (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me parse the expression properly.

Let me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check one of the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As before, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without layers, but that might take longer. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc., as I did before. So, each x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for x_n, which might save time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence is x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is x_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form x_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is x_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition x_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524\nx      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used two methods (step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation), and both gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers to this expression. To solve it, I think I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and then work my way outwards. Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost for clarity. Let's say the innermost is Parentheses 1, then moving outward, Parentheses 2, all the way up to Parentheses 9. So, Parentheses 1 is (1 + 3), Parentheses 2 is (1 + 3(Parentheses 1)), and so on, up to Parentheses 9, which is the entire expression. Let me start by computing Parentheses 1: Parentheses 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, moving outward to Parentheses 2: Parentheses 2: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Parentheses 2 equals 13. Next, Parentheses 3: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Parentheses 3 is 40. Moving on to Parentheses 4: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Parentheses 4 is 121. Hmm, this seems to be growing quite rapidly. Let me continue with Parentheses 5: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Parentheses 5 is 364. Wow, okay, moving on to Parentheses 6: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Parentheses 6 is 1093. That's a big number. Parentheses 7: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, Parentheses 7 is 3280. Next, Parentheses 8: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me do that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Parentheses 8 is 9841. Finally, Parentheses 9: 1 + 3*(Parentheses 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841 first. Hmm, 9841 * 3. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Parentheses 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Parentheses 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4, then each subsequent step: 1+3*previous. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(previous result). Since there are nine layers, I might need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside. Let me number these layers for clarity. Let's consider each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I can compute each layer one by one, starting from Layer 1. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple enough. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's compute 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Each step builds on the previous one, and since I broke it down step by step, I didn't get lost in the complexity. It's interesting how each layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1, leading to exponential growth. It's like each layer is following a geometric progression, which makes sense why the numbers get so large so quickly. I remember that in some problems, especially recursive ones, the solution can often be expressed using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be L(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let's assume a particular solution L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, the formula confirms my step-by-step calculation. That's reassuring. It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with repetitive calculations that can be error-prone. So, in conclusion, by either computing each layer step by step or using the derived formula, we arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Level 8: 1 + 3*(level 7 result). 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, level 9: 1 + 3*(level 8 result). 3*9841 is 29523. 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(level 9 result). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let's do it step by step. 3*20000 is 60000. 3*9000 is 27000, but wait, 29524 is 29,524, so 3*29,524. Let me break it down: 3*20,000 = 60,000; 3*9,000 = 27,000; 3*500 = 1,500; 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did it correctly. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " So, it's like a chain where each link is 1 + 3 times something. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on. That seems manageable. Let me try that approach. I'll compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Got that. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} is A*3^n, and 3*B is 3B, so we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me try expanding a few layers to see if a pattern emerges. Let's start expanding from the inside: Starting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. So, as I can see, each layer is building upon the previous one, and each time, the value is increasing exponentially. The recursive formula we derived earlier shows that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which leads to the closed-form solution using geometric progression. It's interesting how these nested expressions can be broken down using recurrence relations. I think I might have overcomplicated it at first by trying to compute each layer step by step, but it's good to verify with a formula to ensure the answer is correct. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

    "text": " So, it's like a chain of expressions where each one is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count: 1. 1 + 3 2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) ... and so on until the ninth layer. So, actually, there are nine layers here. That might take a while, but I can handle it step by step. Let me start with the innermost layer, which is L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that would be L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so far, so good. Let me keep going. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do that step by step. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the numbers from top to bottom, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nWell, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing L1 to L9, let me go through those steps again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if there's a pattern here or if I can represent this as a geometric series or something, but since each term is built upon the previous one with a linear recurrence, it's more of a linear nested expression rather than a geometric series. So, computing each layer step by step seems to be the most straightforward approach here.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me try to model that.\n\nLet\u2019s define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to f(9). So, indeed, f(9) = 29524, and the total expression is 3*f(9) = 88572.\n\nThis approach confirms the earlier computation.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It might seem tedious to compute each layer, but since each step depends only on the previous one, it's manageable. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of the innermost layer and use it to compute the next, proceeding outward. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.

I'll label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers. \n\nLayer 1: The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2: It's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: It's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 121*3: 100*3 is 300, 20*3 is 60, and 1*3 is 3, so adding those together: 300 + 60 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: Let's break it down. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because it's a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- There are no more digits, so write down the final carry over 2.\n\nSo, putting it together: 2 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Yep, that matches my previous calculation. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the numbers are increasing as expected. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it.\n\nLooking at the expression, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the base case a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that checks out.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same answer, 88572. This gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\nI think I'm done then. The problem was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Since there are nine layers, I think I'll need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's call the innermost expression Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. That looks correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication steps. Sometimes, when multiplying large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me check Layer 9 again: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 0*3=0. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and each time, I made sure to multiply correctly and add 1 at each step. Then, finally, multiplied the outermost layer by 3. So, the final answer should be 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost expression, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last 1 + 3, which is at the very end. So, let me compute that first. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. So, that simplifies the expression a bit. Now, moving one layer out, the next part would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write that down. Second layer from the inside: 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so now that part simplifies to 13. Let me update the expression with this result. The next layer out would be: 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. That's the third layer. Now, moving outward again, the next layer is: 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Fourth layer done. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Fifth layer. Continuing outward, the next part is 1 + 3*(364). Let's see, 3*364 is... Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer. Now, moving outward again, the next part is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that. 3*1093: Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let's calculate that. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer. Now, moving outward again, the next part is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that. 3*9841: Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Ninth layer. Now, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Now, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 88573. But remember, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 88573. Let me calculate that. 88573 * 3: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3 * 88573 equals 265,719.

Step 8: 1 + 3*(step 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Step 8 is 9841. Step 9: 1 + 3*(step 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, step 9 result is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this step 9 result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to compute 29524*3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, but wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6, plus 1=7, write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27, plus 1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6, plus 2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572. So, the entire expression equals 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Each step was computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me verify a couple of the steps to ensure accuracy.\n\nFor example, step 1: 1+3=4, correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct.\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct.\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572, correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involves computing 1 plus three times the result of the previous step. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2.

Multiply the outermost 3 by the result of Layer 9:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers of this 1 + 3(...) structure, each multiplied by 3 at the end. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost and layer 9 is the outermost. So, layer 1 would be (1 + 3), layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(result of layer 1), and so on, until layer 9, which is the entire expression. Let's try that approach.\n\nStarting with layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. So, layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, layer 2 is 13. \n\nNext, layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first: that's 39. Then, adding 1 gives 40. So, layer 3 equals 40.\n\nProceeding to layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result of layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40: that's 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, layer 4 is 121.\n\nMoving on to layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result of layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, layer 5 equals 364.\n\nNow, layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result of layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result of layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, layer 7 equals 3280.\n\nNext, layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result of layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, layer 8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(result of layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's do this carefully. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, layer 9 equals 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original problem is 3 multiplied by layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is layer 9. So, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so after computing layer 9, which is the innermost expression, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, in my earlier approach, I computed up to layer 9, which was the innermost expression, but actually, the entire expression is 3 times the result of layer 9. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if I've correctly computed layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), each nested within the previous one. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times layer 9, which is 3*29524. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I stopped at layer 9 as 29524, but the problem is 3*(layer 9). So, I think I missed that last multiplication by 3. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, but the problem is 3*(layer 9). So, the final answer is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have (1+3(...)), so each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of layer 1.\n- Then, inside that, another ( after 1+3 is layer 2.\n- And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, as I did before. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as above, leading to layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, to avoid computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from a recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let's label each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. That might help me keep track. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer, which is layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, layer 9 simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out to layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result of layer 9). Since layer 9 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, layer 8 simplifies to 13. Next, layer 7: 1 + 3*(result of layer 8). Layer 8 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, layer 7 is 40. Moving on to layer 6: 1 + 3*(result of layer 7). Layer 7 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, layer 6 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result of layer 6). Layer 6 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result of layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 364 times 3: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 4 is 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of layer 4). Layer 4 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 3 is 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of layer 3). Layer 3 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, layer 2 is 9841. Finally, layer 1: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2). Layer 2 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, layer 1 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(result of layer 1). Layer 1 is 29524, so we need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it might make sense.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving out. Let me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the prior. This seems like a geometric series, but it's a bit more complicated because each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me see if I can model this recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute a_2, a_3, ..., a_9 as we did before. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or applying the closed-form formula\u2014the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any calculation errors because each step checks out, and the alternative methods gave me the same result. So, yeah, that's how I solved it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, until Layer 9. Each layer is then multiplied by 3 in the overall expression. Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (another expression)), so maybe each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3 Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) ... and so on, up to Layer 1, which is the innermost. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the last one, so maybe I should start from the innermost and work outwards. Let me clarify: The innermost expression is the last one, which is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's start with the innermost one. Let me list each layer from innermost to outermost. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the last one, so maybe L1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and L2 is 1 + 3*(L1), and so on, up to L9, which is the outermost. Wait, but looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the overall expression is 3*(L9).

So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(L9). So, yes, each layer is defined as L_i = 1 + 3*L_{i-1}, starting from L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is L1, then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, which would be the expression inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the overall expression is 3*L9, so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the L1 to L9 computations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nWait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. So yes, L6=1,093.\n\nL7=1 + 3*1,093.

So total=27,000 +2,523=29,523.\n\nThus, L9=1 +29,523=29,524.\n\nThen, overall expression=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, maybe a formula for such a nested expression. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the layers, each L_i =1 +3*L_{i-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for L_i.\n\nThe recurrence is L_i =1 +3*L_{i-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_i -3*L_{i-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_i = A*3^i -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when i=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_i= (3/2)*3^i -1/2= (3^{i+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_i=(3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for i=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59,049.\n\nSo, L9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the overall expression is 3*L9=3*(29,524)=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. It might have saved time if I recognized the pattern earlier, but at least now I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, this one is 121. Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, that's a big number. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. That's the next layer. Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's the next layer. Now, the next layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's the next layer. Now, moving outward again: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's the next layer. Now, the next layer out: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding these together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. That's the next layer. Finally, moving outward to the very outermost layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute 3*265720. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding these up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161. So, the innermost expression started at 4, and each layer out multiplied by 3 and added 1, which seems to be following a pattern where each step is 3 times the previous result plus 1. But I just computed each layer step by step, which worked. Now, after computing all the layers, the very outermost layer gives me 797161. Then, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that outermost result. So, 3*(797161). Let me compute that. 700000*3 is 2100000, 90000*3 is 270000, 7000*3 is 21000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, and 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. So, 3*797161 is 2391483. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 2,391,483. Wait, that seems like a big number, but given the number of layers, maybe it's correct. Let me just verify my steps quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications or additions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573, 1+3*88573=265720, 1+3*265720=797161. Then, 3*797161=2391483. Hmm, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 2,391,483. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{2391483}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by another (1 + 3(...)). Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that approach. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, that simplifies the expression a bit. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Continuing this way, each time I move out a layer, I compute 1 + 3*(result from the inner layer). Let me try to keep track of each step systematically. Let me list the layers from innermost to outermost as layers 1 to 9, but actually, since the innermost is layer 1, let me index them accordingly.\n\nWait, actually, let's count the number of layers. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer 1), which is layer 2, and so on until layer 9. But wait, looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, actually, there are nine layers of (1 + 3(...)) inside the initial 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each followed by \"1 + 3(...)\", so that means there are nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L9 is the innermost. So, L9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, L8: 1 + 3*(L9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL1: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L1). So, after computing L1 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me check one more time, perhaps by computing each layer step by step again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this more efficiently, especially since computing each layer manually is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nWait, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, starting from L_9 = 4. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}, with L_9 = 4.\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing because usually, recurrence relations are written with L_n in terms of L_{n-1}, but here it's written as L_n in terms of L_{n+1}, which is a bit counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe I can reverse the indices so that L_1 is the innermost and L_9 is the outermost, but that might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as a geometric series. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I expand each layer, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to model this.\n\nWait, for example, if I have L = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), then L = 1 + 3L, which would lead to L = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, which doesn't make sense here because all terms are positive. Hmm, that suggests that this approach might not be appropriate because the series doesn't converge, but in our case, it's a finite number of layers, so maybe we can model it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express each layer in terms of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 9: 4 = 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 8: 13 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nLayer 7: 40 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*3.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLayer 9: 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 8: 13 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 7: 40 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. So, Layer n: L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{9 - n}.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nFor Layer 9: n=9, so L_9 = 1 + 3^{0} = 1 + 1 = 2, but that's not correct because L_9 is 4. Hmm, maybe my indexing is off.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try again.\n\nLayer 9: 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 8: 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 7: 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So, each layer adds another term in the geometric series. Therefore, Layer k (starting from the innermost as k=1) would be the sum from i=0 to i=k of 3^i.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 9, which is 4 = 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen Layer 8 is 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nLayer 7 is 40 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n (where n starts from 1 at the innermost) is the sum from i=0 to i=n of 3^i.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so the outermost layer would be Layer 9, which is the sum from i=0 to i=9 of 3^i.\n\nWait, but that would mean Layer 9 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683.\n\nWait, but that seems too large because when we computed Layer 9 earlier, it was 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps my indexing is off.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer corresponds to one more power of 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, Layer k is the sum from i=0 to i=k of 3^i.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be the sum from i=0 to i=9 of 3^i.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer k, the sum S_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, S_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's the same result as Layer 1 in my earlier computation, which was 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier manual computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me verify using the geometric series approach.\n\nIf each Layer k is S_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, then Layer 9 is S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each layer adds another term, the outermost layer is the sum up to 3^9, which is 3^10 - 1 over 2, as I did before.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me start by solving that and then work my way out. Let me label each level for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)\nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, which will be multiplied by the outermost 3.\n\nSo, starting with Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Level 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Level 2 is 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Level 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Level 3 = 40.\n\nNext is Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 4). Level 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Level 5 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 5). Level 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Level 6 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 6). Level 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 7). Level 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8). Level 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Level 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Level 1 up to Level 9, each step was computed step by step, so maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without manually calculating each level, which might be time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nHmm, thinking about it, each level seems to follow the pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That sounds like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me consider that. If I denote each Level n as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, let's consider the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier calculations to see if it holds.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each level step by step, I can use this formula to find a_n directly. That's much faster and reduces the chance of error.\n\nGiven that, the innermost expression is Level 1: a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent level builds on that. Since there are nine levels, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524. As I computed earlier, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3 * 29524 once again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is correct as I had before. Wait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I think I might have made a mistake in the alignment. Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x         3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let me compute each digit step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10} is 59049, so 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to compute it, and it confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used two methods: step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula, both leading to the same result. It's always good to verify using different approaches to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested expression that's easy to make a mistake in.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern allows us to use a recurrence relation, leading to a closed-form solution. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n1 + 3(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, hold on, that's not quite right. Let me check. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of innermost), and so on. So, let me define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. But actually, since the expression is nested from the inside, maybe I should start with the innermost as L1 and build up. Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer. Then each layer before that is built upon the next. So, perhaps I should start with the ninth layer and work my way back. Let me try that.\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but actually, when I look at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then moving outward, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). So, starting from Layer 1, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire expression, which is up to Layer 9. So, the final result would be 3*(Layer 9). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check the structure again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the first (1 + 3*(...)), which itself is Layer 9 as I defined it. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm numbering the layers correctly. Let me recount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the 9th layer, then each layer before that adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me recompute each layer step by step, making sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nLet me start from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that might be overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73.\n\n29000 \u00d7 3 = 87000.\n\n524 \u00d7 3: 500\u00d73=1500, 24\u00d73=72 \u2192 1500 + 72 = 1572.\n\nNow, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Then 3\u00d729524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, maybe there's a formula for it. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a recurrence relation.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and arrived at 88572, and each step checks out, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) which, when counting the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, starting from the innermost, I think there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, 9 layers in total, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer can be represented as a geometric progression. Let me try that.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, in this case, each a_n is defined in terms of a_{n+1}, which is a bit unusual because typically we have a_n in terms of a_{n-1}. So, perhaps I can rewrite it.\n\nLet me reverse the indices. Let me define a_9 as the innermost term, which is 4, and then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, a_7 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on, up to a_0 = 1 + 3*a_1.\n\nWait, but in our case, the outermost term is a_0, which is 1 + 3*a_1, and then the entire expression is 3*a_0.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write down the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, for n = 0,1,2,...,8.\n\nWith a_9 = 4.\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\na_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3.\n\nBut since we're starting from a_9 and moving upwards, perhaps it's better to express it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n+1} = 0. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. Wait, but in our case, the initial condition is a_9 = 4. So, when n=9, a_9 = 4.\n\nSo, plugging into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^{9} - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC*3^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, C = (9/2) / 3^9 = (9/2) / 19683 = (9)/(2*19683) = 9/39366 = 3/13122.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before, rather than trying to find a closed-form formula, especially since the numbers get large quickly, and the formula might not be necessary here.\n\nBut just to check, let's compute a few terms using the general solution.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = C*3^9 - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683.\n\nThus, C*19683 - 1/2 = 4 \u2192 C*19683 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/19683 = 9/(2*19683) = 3/13122.\n\nNow, let's compute a_8:\n\na_8 = C*3^8 - 1/2 = (3/13122)*6561 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3/13122 * 6561:\n\n3 * 6561 = 19683.\n\n19683 / 13122 = 1.5.\n\nSo, a_8 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1. But wait, from our earlier step-by-step computation, a_8 was 9841, which is way larger than 1. So, something's wrong here. I must have made a mistake in applying the general solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the indices. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the general solution was a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nBut if a_9 = 4, then:\n\n4 = C*3^9 - 1/2 \u2192 C = (4 + 1/2)/3^9 = (9/2)/19683 = 9/(2*19683) = 3/(2*6561) = 1/(4374).\n\nWait, 3/(2*6561) is 3/13122, which is 1/4374.\n\nWait, let me compute a_8 using this C:\n\na_8 = C*3^8 - 1/2 = (1/4374)*6561 - 1/2.\n\n6561 / 4374 = 1.5.\n\nSo, a_8 = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1. But earlier, I calculated a_8 as 9841, which is way off. So, clearly, there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence relation is being applied in the wrong direction. Since each a_n is defined in terms of a_{n+1}, maybe I should adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the recurrence as a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and going up to a_9. Wait, that might make more sense.\n\nWait, let me try that. If I define a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which also matches. So, perhaps I should have modeled the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and n going up to 9.\n\nIn that case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard methods.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the 9th term, a_9, is 29524, as I found earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_0, where a_0 is 1 + 3*a_1. Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...). Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in our earlier setup, a_1 is the innermost term, and each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_9 would be the outermost term. Wait, no, actually, when we defined a_1 as the innermost, then a_2 is the next layer out, and so on up to a_9 being the outermost term. Wait, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the outermost (1 + 3*(...)). Wait, no, actually, let me check.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, if we define a_1 as (1 + 3) =4, then a_2 =1 +3*a_1=13, and so on, up to a_9 being the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and the formula approach also confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. After computing each layer step by step, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\), starting from the innermost \\((1 + 3)\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1 (innermost):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9 (outermost):** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is multiplied by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

That's straightforward. Now, moving to layer 2: Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1 result)). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next inner layer)). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(inner layer)). So, starting from layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Okay, so layer 2 is 39. Now, layer 3 is 3*(1 + 3*(layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39). Let's compute that: 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. So far, layer 1: 4, layer 2: 39, layer 3: 354. Let me do one more to see if I can spot a pattern. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Wow, that's increasing rapidly. I'm starting to think that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding something. Let me check: Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189. So, each time, the inner value is 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiplied by 3. It looks like each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). Maybe I can write a general formula for each layer. Let me denote L1, L2, L3, ..., L9 as the results of each layer from innermost to outermost. So, L1 = 4. Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39. L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354. L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189. L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704. L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339. L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Wait, but the original problem has nine layers, right? Let me check: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1, and then each time we add another layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 3*(...). So, I think I've correctly computed up to layer 9, which would be the outermost expression. So, the result should be 188,329,404. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. L3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct. L4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct. L5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704. Correct. L6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339. Correct. L7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct. L8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct. L9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}). So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula. Let's see: The recurrence is L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let me write the recurrence as L_n = 3 + 9*L_{n-1}. That's because 3*(1) = 3 and 3*(3*L_{n-1}) = 9*L_{n-1}. So, L_n = 9*L_{n-1} + 3. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*9^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*9^1 + B => 4 = 9A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 9*L_1 + 3 = 9*4 + 3 = 36 + 3 = 39, which matches our earlier calculation. Now, using n=2, L_2=39: 39 = A*9^2 + B => 39 = 81A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) 4 = 9A + B 2) 39 = 81A + B Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: 39 - 4 = (81A + B) - (9A + B) => 35 = 72A => A = 35/72. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 4 = 9*(35/72) + B => 4 = (315/72) + B. Simplify 315/72: 315 \u00f7 9 = 35, 72 \u00f7 9 = 8, so 35/8. So, 4 = 35/8 + B => B = 4 - 35/8 = 32/8 - 35/8 = -3/8. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8 = (35/72)*9 = 35/8 - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (35/72)*81 - 3/8 = (35*81)/72 - 3/8. 81/72 = 9/8, so 35*(9/8) = 315/8. Then, 315/8 - 3/8 = 312/8 = 39. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Now, since our problem has 9 layers, n=9. So, L_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8. Let me compute 9^9 first. 9^1 = 9 9^2 = 81 9^3 = 729 9^4 = 6561 9^5 = 59,049 9^6 = 531,441 9^7 = 4,782,969 9^8 = 43,046,721 9^9 = 387,420,489. So, 9^9 = 387,420,489. Now, (35/72)*387,420,489. Let me compute that: 35/72 * 387,420,489. Let's compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 first. 72 * 5,380,000 = 72 * 5,000,000 = 360,000,000. 72 * 380,000 = 72 * 300,000 = 21,600,000; 72 * 80,000 = 5,760,000. So, 72*(5,380,000) = 360,000,000 + 21,600,000 + 5,760,000 = 387,360,000. The remainder is 387,420,489 - 387,360,000 = 60,489. Now, 72 * 839 = 60,489 because 72*800=57,600; 72*39=2,808; 57,600+2,808=60,408. Wait, that's 60,408, but we have 60,489. So, 72*839=60,408, which is 81 less than 60,489. So, 839 + (81/72) = 839 + 1.125 = 840.125. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can compute 35/72 * 387,420,489 as (35 * 387,420,489) / 72. Let me compute 35 * 387,420,489 first. 35 * 387,420,489: 30*387,420,489 = 11,622,614,670; 5*387,420,489 = 1,937,102,445; Adding them together: 11,622,614,670 + 1,937,102,445 = 13,559,717,115. Now, divide that by 72: 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72. Let's see: 72 * 187,700,000 = 72 * 180,000,000 = 12,960,000,000; 72 * 7,700,000 = 72 * 7,000,000 = 504,000,000; 72 * 700,000 = 50,400,000. So, 72 * 187,700,000 = 12,960,000,000 + 504,000,000 + 50,400,000 = 13,514,400,000. The remaining amount is 13,559,717,115 - 13,514,400,000 = 45,317,115. Now, 72 * 630,000 = 45,360,000, which is a bit more than 45,317,115. So, 72 * 629,000 = 72*600,000=43,200,000; 72*29,000=2,088,000; Total=43,200,000+2,088,000=45,288,000. Subtracting that from 45,317,115: 45,317,115 - 45,288,000 = 29,115. Now, 72 * 404 = 29,088, which is 29,115 - 29,088 = 27 remaining. So, total is 187,700,000 + 629,000 + 404 = 188,329,404, and then 27/72 is 0.375. So, total is 188,329,404.375. But since we're dealing with integers, the fractional part must have canceled out, so the exact value is 188,329,404. Then, subtract 3/8: 188,329,404 - 3/8. Wait, but 3/8 is 0.375, so 188,329,404 - 0.375 = 188,329,403.625. But that doesn't make sense because our earlier step-by-step calculation gave us an integer. There must be a mistake in the application of the formula. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me go back. The general solution was L_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8. But when n=9, 9^9 is 387,420,489. So, (35/72)*387,420,489 = (35 * 387,420,489)/72. As computed earlier, that's 13,559,717,115 / 72 = 188,329,404.375. Then, subtract 3/8: 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404. So, the result is 188,329,404, which matches our step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 188,329,404. I think that's correct. Let me just verify one more time with the step-by-step approach. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(9568) = 28,704\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(86,113) = 258,339\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(775,018) = 2,325,054\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(6,975,163) = 20,925,489\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(62,776,468) = 188,329,404\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 188,329,404.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's result is used in the next layer's calculation. This step-by-step approach leads us to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{188329404}$"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). To make this manageable, I'll start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and then work my way outward. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 1. Wait, no, actually, the way it's written, each layer is 1 + 3*(the next layer). So, the innermost is Layer 9: (1 + 3). Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), and so on, until Layer 1, which is multiplied by 3 at the end. Hmm, maybe I should number them from the inside out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this E9.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(E9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this E8.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E7.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(E7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E6.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(E6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(E5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(E4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E3.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(E3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E2.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E1.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(E1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because that's a big number and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach works. Let's say, instead of nine layers, let's take three layers and compute it both by hand and using my method to check if it aligns.\n\nFor example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOuter layer: 3*13 = 39.\n\nNow, using my method:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE1 = 3*13 = 39.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my approach works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying it to the original problem should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, starting from E9 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, but starting from E9, which is 4.\n\nSo, let's see, E9 = 4.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, each E_n is 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, and we have E9 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, with E9 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write it as E_{n} - 3*E_{n+1} = 1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to reverse the indices. Let me define m = 10 - n, so that when n=9, m=1, and when n=1, m=9.\n\nThen, E_n = E_{10 - m}.\n\nThe recurrence becomes E_{10 - m} = 1 + 3*E_{11 - m}.\n\nLet me define F_m = E_{10 - m}, so F_m = 1 + 3*F_{m+1}.\n\nWith F_1 = E_9 = 4.\n\nNow, the recurrence is F_m = 1 + 3*F_{m+1}, with F_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, homogeneous equation: F_m - 3*F_{m+1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3r = 0, which simplifies to -2r = 0, so r=0. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as F_{m+1} = (F_m - 1)/3.\n\nAlternatively, let's write it as F_{m} = 1 + 3*F_{m+1}.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because the index is increasing. Let me try to write the first few terms to see the pattern.\n\nGiven F_1 = 4.\n\nF_1 = 1 + 3*F_2 => 4 = 1 + 3*F_2 => 3*F_2 = 3 => F_2 = 1.\n\nSimilarly, F_2 = 1 + 3*F_3 => 1 = 1 + 3*F_3 => 3*F_3 = 0 => F_3 = 0.\n\nF_3 = 1 + 3*F_4 => 0 = 1 + 3*F_4 => F_4 = -1/3.\n\nThis is getting into fractions, which might complicate things, but perhaps the pattern continues.\n\nF_4 = 1 + 3*F_5 => -1/3 = 1 + 3*F_5 => 3*F_5 = -4/3 => F_5 = -4/9.\n\nHmm, this seems to be getting more complicated, and I'm not sure if this approach is helpful. Maybe it's better to stick with the iterative method since the number of layers is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the values of E_n.\n\nLooking at the values I computed earlier:\n\nE9 = 4\n\nE8 = 13\n\nE7 = 40\n\nE6 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE4 = 1093\n\nE3 = 3280\n\nE2 = 9841\n\nE1 = 29524\n\nI notice that each E_n seems to be following the pattern E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}.\n\nBut I also notice that E_n is increasing rapidly, which makes sense because each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nIf I look at the values:\n\nFrom E9 to E8: 4 to 13, which is 3*4 + 1 =13.\n\nE8 to E7: 13 to 40, which is 3*13 +1=40.\n\nE7 to E6: 40 to 121, which is 3*40 +1=121.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, each step is E_{n} = 3*E_{n+1} +1.\n\nWait, no, in the problem, it's E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n+1}, which is the same as E_n = 3*E_{n+1} +1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is E_n = 3*E_{n+1} +1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving E_n - 3*E_{n+1} =0.\n\nWait, but in terms of E_{n+1}, it's E_{n+1} = (E_n -1)/3.\n\nAlternatively, to write it in standard form, perhaps I can reverse the indices.\n\nLet me define m = 10 - n, so that E_n = F_m, where m = 10 - n.\n\nThen, the recurrence becomes F_m = 1 + 3*F_{m-1}.\n\nWait, that might make more sense.\n\nSo, F_m = 1 + 3*F_{m-1}, with F_1 = E_9 =4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is F_m = C*3^m + particular solution.\n\nLet's find the particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume the particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is F_m = C*3^m -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition F_1 =4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, F_m = (3/2)*3^m -1/2 = (3^{m+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nTherefore, F_m = (3^{m+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since F_m = E_{10 - m}, and we're interested in E1, which is F9.\n\nSo, F9 = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, F9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for E1. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, E1 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E1 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, F9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, E1=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it with a smaller case, solved the recurrence relation, and even computed the final multiplication step by step. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). So, perhaps it's better to approach it step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So, next layer is:\n\n2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, no, actually, let's check. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to write each step more carefully.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the inside out. Let me denote each innermost expression as a1, then a2, a3, up to a9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is:\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, the next layer:\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but each time, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, let me compute each a_n step by step:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a9, because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire inner expression. Wait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the outermost is 3*(...), where ... is the inner expression. So, that inner expression is a9, which we just calculated as 29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute that:\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n9*3=27 \u21927, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 7 5 7 2 7 2?\n\nWait, no, let me do it properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified a9 as 29524. Let me go through each a_n step by step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the sequence.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\na3 =1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\na4=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\na5=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\na6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\na7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\na8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\na9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just verify by computing each step again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n to avoid computing each step manually. Let's see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nBut let's solve it step by step.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that. Let's start from the very inside. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(...)). The innermost part we just computed was 4, so the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Moving out another layer, we have another (1 + 3(...)). The inner part here is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me check if that's consistent. Let's see: starting from the innermost, 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. If I continue this pattern, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, maybe I can model this as a sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, and going out to a_9, which is the outermost. So, I need to compute up to a_9. Let me list them out step by step: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the entire expression. So, after computing a_9, which is the outermost part, we have to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3*a_9. Let me confirm that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, yes, the outermost operation is multiplying the entire nested expression by 3. So, if a_9 is the value of the innermost expression, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, from the above steps, a_9 = 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Then, 3*a9=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Since each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1). Wait, in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, k=3, c=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, since c is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer will involve multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me write each step down. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). Let's compute that.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving outward another layer, we again have 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's compute that.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, okay, so each time we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that in the next layer. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here. So far, we have:\n\n- Layer 1 (innermost): 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n\nWait a second, 4, 13, 40... Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. It seems like each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, mathematically, if I denote each layer as a_n, then:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. I remember that such sequences can sometimes be solved using the method for linear recursions, especially if they're linear and homogeneous. Let me try to solve this recursion to find a general formula for a_n. The recursion is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\nC - 3*C = 1\n-2*C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*A - 1/2\n3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, we can write:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. So, each layer a_n is given by (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times the expression 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is one layer. Let me count:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then 1 + 3(...)\n3. Continuing outward, each time we have another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: because the expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3(...). Wait, actually, the initial expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, so starting from the outermost 3*(...), the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is Layer1. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the outermost 3*(...), the innermost is (1 + 3). Let me see:\n\n- The first innermost: (1 + 3) is Layer1\n- Then moving outward, each 1 + 3*(...) is another layer. Let's count:\n\nAfter Layer1, the next is 1 + 3*(Layer1) which is Layer2\nThen 1 + 3*(Layer2) is Layer3\n...\nContinuing until Layer9, because each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). Wait, but let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer1, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3*(...), there are 8 more opening parentheses. Wait, no, let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) \u2192 the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer1\n2. Then each time we have another 1 + 3*(...), so:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3)\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: because each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer1. Then each time we go outward, we add another layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n- Layer1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n- Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n- Layer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\n- Layer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\n- Layer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\n- Layer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\n- Layer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\n- Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the initial 3*(...), there are 8 more layers. Because:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, after the initial 3*(...), there are 8 more layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, in total, including the innermost, that's 9 layers. So, n=9 in our formula. So, the value of the innermost Layer1 is 4, and Layer9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in our formula, a_n corresponds to each layer. So, Layer1 is a_1=4, Layer2 is a_2=13, and so on up to Layer9, which would be a_9. So, the total expression is 3*(a_9). So, first, let me compute a_9.\n\nUsing our formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, the next digit is 2 (since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4), so 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, no carryover.\n\nSo, the result is 87572? Wait, that doesn't match my initial calculation. Wait, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it another way.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d73 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d73 = 27000 \u2192 total so far: 87000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500 \u2192 total: 88500\n\n20 \u00d73=60 \u2192 total: 88560\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 total: 88572.\n\nYes, so 29524 \u00d73=88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. I thought a_9 is the innermost layer, but the expression is 3*(a_9). Let me confirm.\n\nYes, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), and the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524, and then multiplied by 3, giving 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute each layer step by step without using the formula to verify.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 =1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that matches what I got using the formula. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). I recognized the pattern as a recursive sequence and found a closed-form formula for it. Then, I computed the value for n=9, which was the number of layers in the expression. Finally, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. Alternatively, I could compute each layer step by step, which I did, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where each layer is defined recursively by:\n\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\n1.

After computing Layer 9, I'll multiply it by 3 to get the final result. Okay, let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.

Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out. Let's do that. Let me define each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.

Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 29,524. Let me compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without doing each layer step by step. Let me see.\n\nLooking at each layer, it seems that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. Let's see if I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's check this with our earlier computations to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Thus, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gives the same result as computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's like a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term, starting from the innermost 1+3.\n\nBut since it's nested, it's a bit more complicated. However, the formula we derived earlier seems to handle it well.\n\nWait, another approach: if I let x be the entire expression, then maybe I can express x in terms of itself, but I'm not sure that's the case here because the nesting is finite, not infinite. So, perhaps the step-by-step approach or using the recurrence formula is better.\n\nIn any case, both methods give me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(29524) again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've got it. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value of each layer, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let's start by labeling each level for clarity. Let me define each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9. Level 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Wait, that might not be the best way. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Let me identify that first. Starting from the inside:\n\nInnermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). But wait, the next level is (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the result of the innermost parentheses. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), then the next one is (1 + 3*(innermost result)), and so on. So perhaps each level is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous level. That might form a recursive pattern. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say Level n is defined as: Level n = 1 + 3 * Level (n-1). So, starting from Level 1 as (1 + 3), which is 4, then Level 2 is 1 + 3*4, Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2), and so on until Level 9.\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the outermost term is 3*(...), so perhaps I need to adjust for that. Let me count how many levels there are. Each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost (1+3), that's one level, then each time we go out, it's another level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time, there's another 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Hmm, maybe it's 9 levels deep? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1: 4\n\nThen the next level is (1 + 3*(Level 1)) \u2192 Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Level 9), right? Because the outermost term is 3*(...), where ... is Level 9. So after computing Level 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Let me recount the levels to make sure I didn't miss any. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then each subsequent level adds another 1 + 3*(previous level). So, starting from 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, then 1 + 3*121 = 364, then 1 + 3*364 = 1093, then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So that's 8 levels after the innermost one, making a total of 9 levels. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but when I counted the number of levels, I thought it was 9, but maybe I miscounted. Let me check again by looking at the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each time, moving outward, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Level 1\n2. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 1 \u2192 Level 2\n3. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 2 \u2192 Level 3\n4. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 3 \u2192 Level 4\n5. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 4 \u2192 Level 5\n6. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 5 \u2192 Level 6\n7. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 6 \u2192 Level 7\n8. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 7 \u2192 Level 8\n9. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is Level 8 \u2192 Level 9\n\nYes, that's 9 levels. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm that:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each level. Let me go through each level again to double-check.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here.\n\nEach level is defined as Level n = 1 + 3*Level (n-1), with Level 1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is Level n = 1 + 3*Level (n-1), with Level 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Level n - 3*Level (n-1) = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Level n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Level n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Level n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition Level 1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, Level n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Level n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Level 9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, Level 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches what I got earlier. Good, that's a confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Level 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into levels, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression), so each level is building upon the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, we work our way out, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But in this case, since it's a finite number of levels, it's better to compute each level step by step.\n\nWait, but maybe I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but since it's finite, it's better to compute each level as I did before.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough times. The answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute Level 9 again using the formula:\n\nLevel n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, Level 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step without using the formula, just to ensure that each level is correct.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9 for clarity. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost and will be multiplied by the initial 3. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm that because 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000. Then subtract 476 \u00d7 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in one of the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I compute 3\u00d729524, I get 88572, but I want to make sure that each layer is correct. Let me check Layer 7 again: 3\u00d71093. 1000\u00d73=3000, 93\u00d73=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3\u00d73280. Let's compute 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3\u00d79841. Let me compute 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524. Let me compute 20000\u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12. Wait, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000\u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out, and the final computation is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014direct computation from the inside out and finding a closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer, 88572. This gives me confidence that the solution is correct. I think I've considered all the steps carefully and checked my work, so I'm pretty sure the answer is right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By solving each layer from the innermost outward and verifying with a closed-form formula, we find the value to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3), and then each layer wraps around that. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I can compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me write this down step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I see that each layer is growing quite rapidly. Let me continue. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: I can break this down as 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series, maybe. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. Wait, actually, let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, and the particular solution can be found. Alternatively, we can solve it iteratively, which is what I did earlier, but maybe there's a closed-form formula. Let me try to find it. The general solution for a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + b*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, right? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, here, k = 3, b = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, maybe we need to adjust the indices. Let me think. Let's define a_0 as the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, a_1 would be the next layer, which is 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but let me check this formula. For a recurrence a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b, the solution is a_n = k^{n}*a_0 + b*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Yes, that's correct. So, plugging in k=3, b=1, a_0=4, we get a_n = 3^{n}*4 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me compute a_n for n=9, since we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_0=4, then a_1=13, up to a_8=9841, which is the 9th layer. So, n=8 for a_8. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me clarify. If a_0 is the innermost, then a_1 is the next layer, and so on, up to a_8 being the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*a_8. So, if I can find a_8 using the formula, then multiply by 3, that should give me the result. Using the formula: a_n = 3^{n}*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. So, for n=8: a_8 = 3^{8}*4 + (3^{8} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^8 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Therefore, a_8 = 6561*4 + (6561 - 1)/2. Let me compute each term. 6561*4: 6000*4=24000, 500*4=2000, 60*4=240, 1*4=4. So, 24000 + 2000 = 26000; 26000 + 240 = 26240; 26240 + 4 = 26244. So, 6561*4=26244. Next, (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Therefore, a_8 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, a_8=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. I guess that's the answer then. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure that the result is consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence, and using the closed-form formula to find the 8th term, then multiplying by 3. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same place. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the final layer by 3.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Then, 1 + 39 = 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus the carryover 1 is 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27? Wait, no, wait, the digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, the next digit after the ten thousands is the hundred thousands place, which is 2*3=6, plus any carryover. Wait, but in 29524, the digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it earlier, I thought 29524*3 is 88572. Let me confirm with another method: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just go through each layer again quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. **Layer 1:** 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 2:** 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 3:** 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 4:** 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 5:** 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 6:** 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 7:** 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 8:** 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 9:** 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outward, we compute each step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost 3 by Layer 9's result:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down step by step. Let me assign each layer a number from the innermost to the outermost. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. Let's break that down: 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 1093*3. Let me compute that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841.

So, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, I arrive at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9. Then, after computing Layer 9, I multiply the entire result by 3. That seems like a plan. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 result is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 result is 40.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so:\n\nTotal = 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 times 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, actually, that's breaking it down into parts, but maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly.\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because when I did the digit-wise multiplication:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down earlier, I thought 29524 * 3 is:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just verify all my steps because that's a big number and I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nTotal: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds on the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.

    "text": " So, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let's denote each layer to make it easier. Let me assign variables to each level to avoid confusion. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Let a = 1 + 3\n- Then, b = 1 + 3a\n- Then, c = 1 + 3b\n- And so on, until we get to the outermost layer.\n\nBut wait, how many layers do we have? Let me count again. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result)\n3. Then another layer, and so on, until we have nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is part of a new layer. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is another layer. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...)) parts.\n\nLooking at it:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, each one building on the previous. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay. Let me continue.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another method. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Wait, actually, it's a recurrence relation where each term is a function of the previous one.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I did it both by expanding each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula and compute the final result as 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, there are nine layers to this expression. That means I'll have to compute the innermost one first and then work my way out. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let me define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3 * Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check that. Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Let me compute Layer 4 to see if the pattern continues. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5 would be 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's see: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating that: 3*1093. Hmm, let's break that down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me check 29524*3 again just to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000=87000; 87000 + 1500=88500; 88500 + 60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost layer and working outwards. It took a while, but I think I got it right. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " So, there are nine layers to this expression. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me try that. Let's start by evaluating the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Now, moving one layer out, the next innermost expression is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. First, inside the parentheses, we have 1 + 3 times 4. So, 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, replacing that part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))) Next, moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3(13)). Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. Updating the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) Now, the next innermost is (1 + 3(40)). Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, replacing that, the expression is now: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) Let me keep going. The next innermost is (1 + 3(121)). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) Next, (1 + 3(364)). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, replacing that: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))) Now, moving out, the next is (1 + 3(1093)). 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Updating the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) Next, (1 + 3(3280)). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, now the expression is: 3(1 + 3(9841)) Moving out another layer, (1 + 3(9841)). 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Replacing that, we have: 3(29524) Finally, the last layer is 3 times 29524. Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step. 29524 times 3: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to just multiply 29524 by 3. Let me do that:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's multiply each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, actually, when I multiply 29524 by 3, let me compute it as:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524.\n\nCompute 3 \u00d7 20000 = 60000\n\n3 \u00d7 9000 = 27000\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1500\n\n3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies down to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recount each step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3\u00d74) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3\u00d713) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3\u00d740) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3\u00d7121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3\u00d7364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3\u00d71093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3\u00d73280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3\u00d79841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally: 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the calculations look right. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous result, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d7a_0, where a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), which would be a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d71 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d7a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A\u00d73^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3\u00d7a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, actually, in our problem, the innermost is a_1 = 4, so perhaps the indexing is shifted. Let me check.\n\nWait, if I take a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d7a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. So, perhaps the general term is a_n = 3^{n} + something.\n\nLet me try to find the solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C\u00d73^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C\u00d73^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's use a_0 = 1, as in our problem, but wait, in our problem, the innermost term is a_1 = 4, so perhaps a_0 is 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d7a_0 = 1 + 3\u00d71 = 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, using a_0 = 1:\n\na_0 = C\u00d73^0 - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 1 \u21d2 C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, correct.\n\nn=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as a_1, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nWait, but let me check: the innermost is (1 + 3) = a_1 = 4, then the next is a_2 = 13, and so on, until the outermost expression is a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572, which matches the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, using the formula confirms that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula, let me re-examine the steps. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 1. The general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is indeed found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is straightforward, and the particular solution I found was a constant, which worked because the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Plugging in the initial condition gave me the correct value for C, so the formula seems solid.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\].\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
