Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"
