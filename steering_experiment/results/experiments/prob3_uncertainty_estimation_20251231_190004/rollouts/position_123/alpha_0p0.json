Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to see if the pattern holds. For example, let's compute up to Layer 4 using both methods. Using the recurrence: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=4, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Yep, that matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify with a smaller number of layers to see if the approach is correct. Suppose I have only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Let's compute it step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39. Using the formula, n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Then 3*a_2 = 39, which matches. So, the formula works for n=2. Similarly, for n=1: 3(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Using formula: a_1=4, 3*a_1=12. Correct. So, seems like the approach is valid. Therefore, confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, if I think about it as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the sum can be represented as a geometric progression. But in this case, since each layer is defined in terms of the previous one, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each layer adds another power of 3, so the total is a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(something). So, expanding it all out, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is equivalent to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure if that's accurate because each term is nested, not added directly. Wait, actually, let's see: If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Hmm, but that seems like it's building up a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see if that's the case. Let's suppose that the entire expression is S. Then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) But the inner part is similar to S, except that S starts with 3*(...). Wait, actually, the inner expression is similar but one layer less. Let me define S_n as the expression with n layers. Then, S_n = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Then, S_n = 3*(1 + S_{n-1}) for n >=1, with S_0 = 0? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, but in our case, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so maybe S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3*(1 + S'), where S' is the inner expression with one fewer layer. Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, since I already have a closed-form solution using the recurrence, maybe it's better to stick with that. Either way, both methods lead me to the same answer: 88572. So, I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.
