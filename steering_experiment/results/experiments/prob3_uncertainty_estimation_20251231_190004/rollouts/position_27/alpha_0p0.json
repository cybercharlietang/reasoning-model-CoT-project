    "text": " Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3. I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it as (29500 + 24) * 3 = 29500*3 + 24*3 = 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, all the steps check out. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent errors. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have allowed me to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recursive relation. Maybe I can model it as a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I know that for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the homogeneous equation would be a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, and the particular solution would account for the constant term 1. The characteristic equation for the homogeneous part is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms the previous result without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I was able to derive the formula, it's a good approach for future problems of this type. In summary, by recognizing the recursive pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I found a direct formula to compute the value of the innermost expression and then scaled it up by the outermost factor of 3. This approach saved time and reduced the chance of error compared to computing each layer step by step, although both methods led to the same result. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer to this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By recognizing the recursive pattern and solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Using this formula, we compute the innermost expression and then scale it by the outermost factor of 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's compute this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my layers. Starting from the inside: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Each time, I took the previous layer, multiplied by 3, added 1, and that became the next layer. Then, finally, multiplied the outermost layer by 3. All these steps seem logical, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the whole thing. So, the final step is to compute: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Well, 29524*3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000*3) + (9000*3) + (500*3) + (24*3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572 Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in my calculations. Let me double-check each step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, that's right. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. However, if there were more layers, a formula would be more efficient. Let me think if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. If I can find a closed-form expression, that might save time, but since the number of layers is small, it's not necessary here. Alternatively, recognizing that this is a geometric series? Let me see. Let's write down the terms:\n\na1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the value is 88,572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have computed a9 directly as (3^{10} -1)/2, then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step, it's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result. I think I'm confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me just verify if I did all the layers correctly. Maybe I can compute a couple of them again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40, correct.

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D, which implies D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier result. That's reassuring.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute: 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started by computing the innermost parentheses, which was 1+3=4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 +3*(previous layer). I did this up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29,524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88,572.

Let me do it digit by digit: 29,524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 88,572. So, yes, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, just to make sure, let me try computing the expression step by step again, maybe in a different way, to see if I get the same result. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 more efficiently. Let me try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_n, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using a different method, recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of each until we reach the outermost layer. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, confirming the result through a different method. The final computation yields the value 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = ? Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in multiplying. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. Maybe that's correct. Let me just verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). Let's see if I can find a general formula for this recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, with a(1) = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a(n) - 3*a(n-1) = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the innermost being layer 1 and the outermost being layer 9, so the outermost layer is a(9). Therefore, a(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^n terms, but I think the way I did it is correct. So, I think the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again with the formula. For n=4: a(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, we have: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3. First, 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. Next, 2*3=6 +1=7.

Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me break this down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each step involved multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That's correct. Layer 4: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88,572. That seems right. Hmm, another way to think about this is that each layer is following the pattern of a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, the recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me plug B into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have a_9, which is the 9th layer. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since I already solved it step by step and verified with the formula, I'm confident that the result is correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final computation is: 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, each layer's value is computed by taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. So, starting from the innermost 1+3=4, each subsequent layer adds more by tripling the previous and adding 1. Then, finally, after computing the outermost layer, which is Layer 9 giving 29524, we multiply that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count them wrong. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. I computed each layer from 1 to 9, so that's correct. Also, each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1, which follows the structure of the expression. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then adding 1 gives 29524. So that's correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's right, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Sometimes, when there's a repeating pattern like this, it might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this expression as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is Layer 1. Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a\u2099. Let's try solving the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 with a\u2081 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u21d2 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a\u2081 = 4: 4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3\u00b9\u2070 is 59049, so a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms my earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524.

Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result should be 88,572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, actually, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break that down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572.

But wait, let me go back a step. Did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Let's see: Layer 8 was 9841. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

So, 88572. Okay, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to check. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 +3 =4. a_2 =1 +3a_1. a_3=1 +3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r-3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =3C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9 using the formula. a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as we got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives us the same result, confirming that our step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression might give a geometric series. Let me try expanding it. Let's write the entire expression:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me denote each nested part as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define the innermost as E1=1+3=4.\n\nThen E2=1+3*E1=1+3*4=13.\n\nE3=1+3*E2=40.\n\nE4=1+3*E3=121.\n\nE5=1+3*E4=364.\n\nE6=1+3*E5=1093.\n\nE7=1+3*E6=3280.\n\nE8=1+3*E7=9841.\n\nE9=1+3*E8=29524.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*E9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nWhich can be written as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nLet me see if I can write this as a sum. Let's consider each multiplication by 3 as a coefficient. If I expand it, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me denote the innermost as E=1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*E, where E is the previous layer.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of exponents. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the coefficients would be powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the entire expression by expanding it step by step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 =1 + 3*4=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +39=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1+120=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1+363=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1+1092=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1+3279=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1+9840=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, as we did before, gives us the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis recurrence can be solved as we did before, but perhaps another way is to write out the expansion.\n\nLet me try to expand the entire expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 =1 +3.\n\nE2=1 +3*(E1)=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*(E2)=1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nIf I expand each layer, I can write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\n=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\n=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nIt's getting too nested, but perhaps if I expand all the terms, I can see a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The general form of a geometric series is S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^{n-1}.\n\nBut in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. We already solved it earlier, so perhaps that's the most straightforward way.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try to write out the expanded form.\n\nLet me consider the entire expression as 3*(E9), where E9=1 +3*E8.\n\nSimilarly, E8=1 +3*E7, and so on.\n\nIf I substitute all the way down, I can write the entire expression as:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\n=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nBut if I keep expanding, each '1' will be multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to see how many times each 1 is multiplied by 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost 1:\n\nThe innermost 1 is in E1=1+3.\n\nThis 1 is multiplied by 3 in E2, then by 3 again in E3, and so on, up to E9, and then by the outermost 3.\n\nWait, actually, each '1' in the layers is multiplied by 3 a certain number of times, depending on its depth.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nThe innermost 1 is in E1, which is at depth 9 (since there are 9 layers). Wait, actually, the innermost is E1, which is the 9th layer from the outside. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each '1' in the k-th layer is multiplied by 3^{9 -k +1}.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9.\n\nThen, the innermost layer (layer 1) is 1 +3, which is 4.\n\nLayer 2 is 1 +3*(layer 1).\n\nLayer 3 is 1 +3*(layer 2).\n\n...\n\nLayer 9 is 1 +3*(layer 8).\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(layer 9).\n\nSo, each '1' in layer k is multiplied by 3^{9 -k +1} times.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIn layer 1: the '1' is added to 3, but it's only used in layer 2.\n\nIn layer 2: the '1' is added to 3*(layer 1), so it's 1 +3*(layer1).\n\nSimilarly, in layer 3: 1 +3*(layer2).\n\nSo, each '1' in layer k is multiplied by 3^{9 -k} times.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe '1' in layer 1 is multiplied by 3 in layer 2, then by 3 in layer 3, and so on up to layer 9, and then by the outermost 3.\n\nSo, the '1' in layer 1 is multiplied by 3^8 (since from layer 2 to layer 9, that's 8 multiplications by 3), and then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in layer 2 is multiplied by 3^7 in layer 3, and so on, up to the outermost 3, making it 3^8.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLet me denote the '1's as follows:\n\nThe innermost '1' is in layer 1: it's multiplied by 3 in layer 2, then by 3 in layer 3, ..., up to layer 9, and then by the outermost 3.\n\nSo, from layer 1 to layer 9, it's multiplied by 3 eight times, and then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in layer 2 is multiplied by 3 in layer 3, up to layer 9, and then by the outermost 3, so that's seven multiplications by 3, making it 3^8.\n\nContinuing this way, the '1' in layer k is multiplied by 3^{9 -k} times, and then by the outermost 3, making it 3^{10 -k}.\n\nWait, but let me think again.\n\nWait, the total expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nLayer9=1 +3*layer8.\n\nSo, the '1' in layer9 is multiplied by 3 once (from layer9 to the outermost 3), so that's 3^1.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in layer8 is multiplied by 3 in layer9, then by 3 in the outermost, so that's 3^2.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider each '1' in the layers and how many times it's multiplied by 3 before reaching the outermost multiplication.\n\nThe innermost '1' (in layer1) is in E1=1+3. Then, this is used in E2=1+3*E1, which is layer2. So, the '1' from E1 is multiplied by 3 once in E2. Then, E2 is used in E3=1+3*E2, so the '1' from E1 is multiplied by 3 again, making it 3^2. This continues up to E9, where it's multiplied by 3 eight times, and then the outermost 3 multiplies it again, making it 3^9.\n\nSimilarly, the '1' in layer2 is used starting from E3, so it's multiplied by 3 seven times, and then by the outermost 3, making it 3^8.\n\nWait, perhaps the total sum is the sum of 3^{k} for k from 0 to 9, but let me check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nEach '1' in layer k is multiplied by 3^{9 -k} times before the outermost 3 is applied. Then, the outermost 3 is multiplied once more, making it 3^{10 -k}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire expression as follows:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1 +3))...)) with nine layers.\n\nThis is equivalent to 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) \n\nIf we expand this, each '1' inside is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Specifically, the innermost '1' is multiplied by 3 eight times, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9. The next '1' is multiplied by 3 seven times, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^8. This continues until the '1' in the outermost parentheses, which is multiplied by 3^0=1, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^1.\n\nWait, that seems promising. So, the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Let me check:\n\nIf I have nine '1's, each multiplied by 3^k, where k goes from 0 to 8, and then multiplied by 3, that would be 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k).\n\nWait, but let's compute that sum.\n\nSum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=8, so sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ).\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*( (19683 -1)/2 ) = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but that's not matching our previous result of 88572. Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check. The sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is indeed (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841.\n\nThen, 3*9841=29523, which is the value of a_9, as we computed earlier. But the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29523=88572. So, perhaps my approach here is incorrect because I'm missing a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of terms. Let me recount.\n\nIn the expression, each '1' is at a different depth. Let's see: The innermost '1' is in the 9th layer from the outside, right? So, the number of '1's is 9, each multiplied by 3 a different number of times.\n\nWait, let me try to list them:\n\n- The innermost '1' (layer1): multiplied by 3 eight times, then by the outermost 3: total 3^9.\n\n- The next '1' (layer2): multiplied by 3 seven times, then by the outermost 3: total 3^8.\n\n- Similarly, up to the '1' in layer9: multiplied by 3 zero times, then by the outermost 3: total 3^1.\n\nWait, but in our expression, we have nine layers, so the number of '1's is nine, each contributing 3^{9 -k} where k is from 1 to 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the total sum is sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^{k}.\n\nWait, let me compute that: sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k=3*(3^9 -1)/(3-1)=3*(19683 -1)/2=3*19682/2=3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before, and that's equal to a_9=29523. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29523=88572.\n\nWait, so the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is 29523, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut that seems to align with our previous computation.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each '1' in the layers is contributing a term of 3^{n}, where n is the number of times it's been multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the innermost '1' is multiplied by 3 eight times, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9.\n\nThe next '1' is multiplied by 3 seven times, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^8.\n\nContinuing this, the '1's contribute 3^9, 3^8, 3^7, ..., 3^1.\n\nSo, the total sum is 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWhich is a geometric series with first term a=3, ratio r=3, and number of terms n=9.\n\nThe sum S = a*(r^n -1)/(r-1) = 3*(3^9 -1)/(3-1)=3*(19683 -1)/2=3*19682/2=3*9841=29523.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k)=3*29523=88572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because if I compute 3*(sum from k=1 to9 of 3^k), that would be 3*29523=88569, but earlier we got 88572. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, let's compute sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k:\n\n3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n3 +9=12\n\n12+27=39\n\n39+81=120\n\n120+243=363\n\n363+729=1092\n\n1092+2187=3279\n\n3279+6561=9840\n\n9840+19683=29523.\n\nYes, sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523.\n\nThen, 3*29523=88569.\n\nWait, but earlier, when we computed step by step, we got 88572. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, that suggests that my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, let me check: When we computed a_9=29524, which is 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, which would make the total expression 3*29523=88569, which is 3 less than 88572.\n\nSo, where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of terms or the exponents.\n\nWait, let me consider that the innermost '1' is in layer1, which is E1=1+3=4.\n\nThis '1' is in the innermost parentheses, and each time we go out a layer, we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, the '1's are as follows:\n\n- Layer1: 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times, then by the outermost 3: 3^9.\n\n- Layer2: 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times, then by outermost 3: 3^8.\n\n- ...\n\n- Layer9: 1 is multiplied by 3 zero times, then by outermost 3:3^1.\n\nSo, the sum is 3^1 +3^2 + ... +3^9= sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(sum from k=1 to9 of3^k)=3*29523=88569.\n\nBut that conflicts with our step-by-step computation where we got 88572.\n\nWait, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 3*(sum from k=1 to9 of3^k)=3*(29523)=88569.\n\nBut in our step-by-step, we had a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so there's a difference of 3. That suggests that perhaps my sum approach is missing a term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the initial '1's in the layers.\n\nWait, when we computed a_9=29524, which is 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nSo, a_9=29524=1 +3*a_8.\n\nBut a_8=9841=1 +3*a_7=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nSimilarly, each a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, when we expand the entire expression, it's 3*a_9=3*(1 +3*a_8)=3*1 +3*3*a_8=3 +9*a_8.\n\nBut a_8=1 +3*a_7, so 9*a_8=9*(1 +3*a_7)=9 +27*a_7.\n\nSimilarly, 3 +9 +27*a_7.\n\nContinuing this way, each expansion adds a term and multiplies the next a by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the total expression can be written as sum from k=0 to8 of3^{k+1} +3^{9}.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the total expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) which can be represented as 3 + 9 +27 + ... +3^9 +3^{10}.\n\nWait, but that seems too much.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me instead compute the total expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to8 of3^k) +3*1.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, another approach: Each layer adds a term of 3^{n} where n is the number of layers from that point to the outermost multiplication.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation, which gave us 88572, and the formula using the closed-form solution also gave us 88572, so that's likely correct.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the sum approach is missing something, perhaps because each '1' in the layers is contributing an additional term beyond just the geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 is more accurate, as it correctly accounts for the recurrence.\n\nIn any case, given that both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give us 88572, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives us 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence, but since each layer depends directly on the previous one, computing each step by step seems manageable and less error-prone. I don't think there's a formula that can simplify this directly because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which doesn't form a simple geometric progression. So, computing each layer step by step is probably the most straightforward method here. Another way to look at it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), so it's a recurrence relation. If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4, and going up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. But regardless of how I look at it, the step-by-step computation seems to be the way to go. So, after carefully computing each layer and making sure each step is correct, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4, L_2=1 +3*L1, and so on up to L_9. So, each L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B =4. Now, let's find another equation. For n=2, L_2=13. Using the recurrence, L_2=3*L1 +1=3*4 +1=13. Using the general solution: L_2= A*3^2 + B=9A + B. So, 9A + B=13. Now we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B =4\n\n2) 9A + B=13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B)=13 -4 =>6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2=1.5.\n\nNow, substitute A=3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B=4 =>9/2 + B=4 =>B=4 -9/2=8/2 -9/2= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2. Simplify that: (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: L1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2:59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula. Let's try n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which is correct as I had earlier. So, the formula holds. Therefore, my step-by-step computation was correct, and the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can efficiently compute each layer. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the final value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big.

Let's break it down:\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. So, I think I'm done here. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I feel confident about the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nBy recognizing the recursive pattern, each layer can be computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Alternatively, a closed-form formula using a recurrence relation can be derived, leading to the same result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})$.

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000) = 60000, 3*(9000) = 27000, 3*(500) = 1500, 3*(20) = 60, 3*(4) = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression at layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.

    "text": " Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, let me break this down: 29524 * 3. I can compute this step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, that's right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, yes. Then, 3*29524=88572, as above. So, it seems my calculations are consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a=3, which is greater than 1, so the formula might be slightly different. Let me recall the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. The solution is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But in our case, L_1=4, which is the innermost layer. Let me check if I can adjust the formula accordingly. Let me try to compute L_n for n layers. Let's see: For n=1, L_1=4=1+3*1. For n=2, L_2=1 + 3*4=13. For n=3, L_3=1 + 3*13=40. Hmm, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3=4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous layer. So, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, would correspond to n=9. So, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, this confirms that the value is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the formula, starting from n=9, then the outermost expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the value step by step or derive a closed-form formula. \n\nStarting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1.

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct up to Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, because the recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssuming a_p is a constant, substituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing any layers. The original expression has nine layers, so n=9 is the outermost layer. Therefore, the formula applies correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost 1+3, which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, after nine layers, it's Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{9} -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because the layers go up to Layer 9, which is (3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 ) = (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut let me compute 3^{11} to check:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(...)\n\nSo, the first innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" before the closing parentheses.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then inside that is 1+3(...), so each time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, yes, nine layers, so n=9, leading to a_n = (3^{10} -1)/2, then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression inside the outermost 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote S as the entire expression inside the outermost 3, then S = 1 + 3*S_inner, where S_inner is the next layer.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating it more than necessary. Since I already have a formula that works, and the step-by-step computation matches the formula, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from 4, each next layer is 3*previous +1.\n\n4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nYes, each term is 3 times the prior plus 1.\n\nSo, 4*3 +1=13, 13*3 +1=40, etc.\n\nTherefore, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds true.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I added 20000*3, 9000*3, etc., I think I made a mistake in breaking down 29524. Let me try another approach. 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but when I calculated each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, maybe I should check if I correctly accounted for all the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)). Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers, right? So, Layer 1: innermost 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, up to Layer 9: 1+3*Layer8=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Let me write down the general formula for a_n. a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But wait, in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me think. Let's define a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/2, but we need to find a_0 such that when n=1, a_1=4. Let me set n=1: a_1=3^{1} * a_0 + (3^{1} -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. But a_1=4, so 3*a_0 +1=4 => 3*a_0=3 => a_0=1. So, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} *1 + (3^{n} -1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2. Let me simplify that: a_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Starting from the innermost, which is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524. So, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's correct, which matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a formula to confirm, and recalculated the final multiplication to ensure accuracy.

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

So, the final step is: Final result: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: I can break this down as 3*29000 + 3*524 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes.

Wait, that might not be the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 2*3=6 (for the ten thousands place), 9*3=27 (thousands place, carryover 2), 5*3=15 +2=17 (hundreds place, carryover 1), 2*3=6 +1=7 (tens place), 4*3=12 (units place). Wait, that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.
