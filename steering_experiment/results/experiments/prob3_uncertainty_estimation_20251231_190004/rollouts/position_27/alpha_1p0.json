    "text": " Hmm, this is getting bigger quickly. Let's see if I can find a pattern or maybe a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me try to compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4 is 40, so Layer 5 would be: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wait, that's the same as Layer 4. That can't be right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in labeling the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I should think of it as a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me try that approach. Let's define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(a9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check each step: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large so quickly. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The sequence is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is of the form a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms: For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But let me double-check 3^10 to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Therefore, 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 manually: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Then 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that seems right. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which we just calculated as 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572? Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should do it more carefully. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Finally, 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out from last to first: 8, then 7, then 7, then 8, then 5, then 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 =27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 =6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 0\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write down the carryover if any, but here it's 0, so the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3. 29,524 \u00d7 3: 20,000 \u00d73=60,000; 9,000\u00d73=27,000; 500\u00d73=1,500; 20\u00d73=60; 4\u00d73=12. So adding those up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +60=88,560; +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So 3 \u00d7 29,524 =88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29,524, right? So the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 (Layer 9) =3 \u00d729,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo yes, each layer is correct. Then, 3\u00d729524=88,572. So the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost: Each time you have a (1 +3(...)), so let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times the pattern (1 +3(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 +3(...), and that ... has 8 more layers. Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me parse the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, you have a 1 +3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3) \u2192 Layer 1: 4\n2. 1 +3*(Layer1) \u2192 Layer2:13\n3. 1 +3*(Layer2) \u2192 Layer3:40\n4. 1 +3*(Layer3) \u2192 Layer4:121\n5. 1 +3*(Layer4) \u2192 Layer5:364\n6. 1 +3*(Layer5) \u2192 Layer6:1093\n7. 1 +3*(Layer6) \u2192 Layer7:3280\n8. 1 +3*(Layer7) \u2192 Layer8:9841\n9. 1 +3*(Layer8) \u2192 Layer9:29524\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(Layer9) \u2192 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, each starting with 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, the initial count was correct, 9 layers inside, each adding a 1+3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, which is correct. So, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute Layer9 again: 1 +3*Layer8=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover2\n\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover2\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8\n\nWait, but that seems like I'm writing digits in reverse order. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nCompute each digit from right to left:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover0\nNow, since there are no more digits, we stop. So, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts.\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4\n\nSo, 3\u00d720000=60000\n\n3\u00d79000=27000\n\n3\u00d7500=1500\n\n3\u00d720=60\n\n3\u00d74=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Then 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right. Let me keep going.

So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because each time I multiplied by 3 and added 1, the numbers got large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me verify the final multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate.

    "text": " Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here, but maybe it's just better to keep computing each layer step by step without looking for a pattern yet. Let me proceed carefully.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*40 = Wait, no, Layer 4 was 40, so Layer 5 would be 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121? Wait, that's the same as Layer 4. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake? Let me check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Oh, I see, I think I made a mistake in my previous step. So, Layer 5 is 364, not 121. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost layer. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, the outermost is Layer 9, so 3*Layer9 is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me count the number of times '1 + 3(' occurs in the original problem.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1+3(' is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1+3(' is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of '1+3(' occurrences:\n\n1. The first 1+3 is inside the last set of parentheses.\n2. Then each time you go out, you have another 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times '1+3(' appears, excluding the very first one. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation for Layer 9 again, because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 9841*3 is indeed 29523.\n\n9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523, yes. Then 29523 +1=29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of '1+3(' in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach '1+3(' is a new layer. So, starting from the first '1+3(', each subsequent '1+3(' adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of '1+3(' after the initial 3 is 9, meaning there are 9 layers, each adding a new '1+3('.\n\nSo, that would mean that Layer1 is the innermost 1+3, then Layer2 is the next one out, and so on up to Layer9, which is the outermost. Therefore, the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the layers again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of them.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me see.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\na3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's a confirmation using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that n=9 in the formula corresponds to the number of layers. In the problem, we have 9 layers of '1+3(' after the initial 3, so yes, n=9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of times we apply the 1+3*() operation. Since the innermost is 1+3, which is the first application, then each layer adds another application. So, 9 applications correspond to n=9.\n\nTherefore, the formula gives a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\na1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\na2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na9=(3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, everything checks out. Therefore, the answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the ninth layer's value as 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each being 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do that step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; So, 88572? Wait, that seems off. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\nNext, 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nNext, 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext, 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext, 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. So, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct)\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct)\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct)\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct)\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524=88572 (correct)\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1093. 1093 *3: 3*3=9, 3*9=27, carryover 2, 3*0=0 +2=2, 3*1=3. So 3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 *3: 0*3=0, 8*3=24, carryover 2, 2*3=6 +2=8, 3*3=9. So, 9840. Then +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, carryover1, 8*3=24 +1=25, carryover2, 9*3=27 +2=29. So, 29523. Then +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write8, carryover2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again because sometimes when I do a lot of steps, I might have missed a carryover or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value is 88572. Hmm, so I think that's the correct answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence approach. It's easy to get confused with these nested expressions, so cross-verifying is always a good idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me think of each term as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, expanding the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but this seems recursive. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but since there are nine layers, it's a finite recursion, so perhaps the approach I took earlier is better.\n\nBut since I already have a formula for L_n, and it correctly gives me the value for each layer, I can be confident that L_9=29524, and thus E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for a finite geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L_1=4, each subsequent L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}.\n\nIf I unroll the recursion, I can write L_n as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))) with n-1 ones. So, for L_n, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*(1). Wait, maybe not exactly, because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's try to unroll the recursion for L_n.\n\nL_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}\nL_{n-1}=1 +3*L_{n-2}\n...\nL_2=1 +3*L_1\nL_1=4\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nL_2=1 +3*4=13\nL_3=1 +3*13=40\nL_4=1 +3*40=121\n...\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nIf I expand L_n, it would be:\n\nL_n =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3*4)...)))\n\nWhich would result in a sum of powers of 3. Let me see if I can express L_n as a sum.\n\nFrom the recurrence relation, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. So, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this, perhaps by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so it's like each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in the recurrence relation, each L_n is 1 +3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, not a geometric series, but the solution ends up being a geometric progression because of the nature of the recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, if I write out L_n, it's 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))) with n terms. So, expanding this, it's 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 + ... +3^{n-1} +3^{n}*(1). Wait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is 1, not 3^k. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If I have L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, then unrolling the recursion gives:\n\nL_n =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(... +3*4)...))) with n-1 ones.\n\nSo, expanding this, it's 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 + ... +3^{n-1} +3^{n}*(1). Wait, no, because each time you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, so it's more like a sum where each term is 3^k, but starting from 1.\n\nWait, perhaps L_n can be expressed as the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but I think that's not the case because of the way the recursion works.\n\nWait, let me compute L_n using the formula I found: L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=1, L_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which is correct. For n=2, L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, correct. So, yes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out for the first few layers, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait a second, I'm getting 4, 13, 40, 121... Hmm, these numbers seem familiar. They look like they're increasing rapidly, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Wait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay, moving on. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. Wait, no, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So, units digit is 2, carryover 1.\nTens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\nHundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\nThousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\nTen-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe using another approach to multiply:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nWe can break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace the layers to ensure each step was correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be represented by a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier result without having to compute each layer manually. It's much faster with the formula, but since I didn't think of it initially, I had to compute each layer step by step, which took a bit longer but helped me understand the pattern better.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer approach and the formula using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, that seems like a big jump. Let me check that again. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Then 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, okay, seems correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60,000; 9000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 88,572. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers I computed earlier. So, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, and so on. Looking at the numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given that L1 = 4, and L2 = 13. Let's plug in n=1: L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost being Layer 1, and the outermost being Layer 9, which is used in the final multiplication by 3. So, Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost layer is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. As I did before, 29524*3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 29524 *3 = 88572. That seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I can confidently say that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes this time. Each step built upon the previous one, and the calculations seem consistent. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the result is then used in the next outer layer. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\nHere's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step.\n\nStarting again from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. Hmm. Maybe I didn't make a mistake after all. But just to be sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 in another way. Let's break down 29524:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24\n\nSo, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... nine times ... )). So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*previous layer. So, after computing up to Layer 9, we have 29,524, and then 3*29,524 is 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me consider whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same as before. Therefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check my calculations again. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. That's right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but it's correct. Let me proceed to Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, so the innermost Layer 1 is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost, we have 29524. But the entire expression is 3 times this Layer 9, right? Because the problem starts with 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check if I did each step correctly. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's not the right way. Let me compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6, plus 1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27, plus 1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6, plus 2=8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication steps. Sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might slip up. Let me recompute 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that might not be the best approach, but just to check, 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 29524 * 3 = 90000 - (476 * 3). Compute 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410, plus 18 is 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, let's assume a steady-state solution where L_n = L_{n-1} = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, but that might complicate things because we have fractions, but let's see.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is L_n^p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of this formula. Since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the outermost layer is L_9, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which also gives 88572.\n\nThis seems consistent with all the methods I've tried. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each calculation to avoid errors.\n\n3. Realize that each layer follows a recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula for it.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer directly, then multiply by 3.\n\n5.

    "text": " Wait, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Let me keep going a few more layers to see if there's a pattern or formula I can use. Layer 4: 1 + 3*13 = 40? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me correct that. Wait, Layer 2 was 13, so Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Then Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Then Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Hmm, okay, that's getting big quickly. Let me try to list them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do that step by step. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524\n*       3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because that seems a bit off. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that by another method. Let's break down 29,524:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\nSo, 20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer is correct. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a layer. The original expression has nine layers inside the first 3(...). Let me count the parentheses again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3...\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers, each corresponding to a layer from 1 to 9 as I computed earlier. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but wait, actually, the standard solution is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0 - b/(1 - a)) + b/(1 - a). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nFor a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(1 - a^{n}) / (1 - a), where L_0 is the initial term.\n\nIn our case, L_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nWait, so L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc.\n\nSo, using the formula, the nth term would be L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (1)*(1 - 3^{n}) / (1 - 3). But wait, our initial term is L_1 = 4, so maybe we need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of L_n in terms of L_1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to express L_n in terms of L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula, let me think again.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4.\n\nWe found the general solution as L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. Therefore, the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing a base-3 expansion or something similar, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the value at each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 as per the original expression yields the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\( 1 + 3(\\text{next term}) \\). There are nine such nested layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Start from the innermost layer and work outward:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524 \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Then 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, that seems right. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, the recurrence relation would be: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3*C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with nine layers inside. Wait, let me make sure. The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 corresponds to n = 9 in the formula. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of n layers, it would be 3*a_n, where a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, it's 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with nested expressions like this. So, to recap: I broke down the expression into layers, computed each layer step by step, then recognized a pattern that allowed me to use a closed-form formula for the nth layer, and finally computed the result using both methods to confirm consistency. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2192 Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), so when I computed Layer 9, that was the innermost part, and each subsequent layer was built upon that. So, actually, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3\u00d729,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time wrapping another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous), it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me think about whether there's a formula for that.\n\nIf we have a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then we can solve it as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's find A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer evaluating to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, I'm getting 40 for Layer 3. Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. So, Layer 3 is 40. Then Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, moving on. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279. So, 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, breaking it down as 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by this recurrence relation. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually might be the simplest way. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I approached it both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or derive a closed-form formula. The closed-form formula for the nth layer is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9 and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, that would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to see if I added correctly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093. Hmm, but 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let me compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so I think I did that correctly. Let me just check once more to be absolutely sure.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for L_n, maybe I can compute it without calculating each layer step by step. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. So that's another way to get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it multiple times using both step-by-step computation and a general formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Maybe I can verify each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct).

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. Each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This recursive formula might be a geometric sequence, but let me see. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe that's overcomplicating it for this problem. Alternatively, I can compute each term step by step as I did before, which seems manageable since there are only nine layers. But let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants. To find C and D, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence relation. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} + D = 3C + D = 4. Now, using the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substitute the general solution into this: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Now, equate the coefficients: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, substitute D back into the initial condition: 3C + (-1/2) = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4})/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and arrive at the same answer, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer, resulting in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, let me check each layer computation again to ensure I didn't make an error earlier because the numbers are growing quite rapidly, and it's easy to miscalculate. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, can I find a closed-form solution for a_n? Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is solvable. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3*r, which gives r=0, but that might not be the right approach. Wait, actually, for the recurrence a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n-1}*(a_1) + d*(c^{n-1} - 1)/(c - 1). Let me verify that. Yes, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is indeed a_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n} + d/(c - 1). Alternatively, sometimes written as a_n = c^{n-1} * a_1 + d*(c^{n-1} - 1)/(c - 1). Let me plug in the values. Here, c=3, d=1, a_1=4, and n=9. So, a_9 = 3^{8} * 4 + 1*(3^{8} - 1)/(3 - 1). Let's compute that. First, compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Now, a_9 = 6561 * 4 + (6561 - 1)/2. Let's compute each part: 6561 * 4: 6561 * 4 = 26244. (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. So, a_9 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once more, maybe using the formula to see if I can find a pattern or a shortcut. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each multiplication step carefully. Let's compute each layer's value:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nEach step seems correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this multiplication step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 29524 as 29000 + 524. Then, 29000 * 3 = 87000, and 524 * 3 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. That confirms the result again.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer. Each layer's value is then used in the next computation. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * C + b/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nSo, the general solution would be L_n = 3^n * C + 1/(1 - 3) = 3^n * C - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: L_1 = 3^1 * C - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3^n)*(3/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor Layer 1 (n=1): (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7 (n=7): (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8 (n=8): (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9 (n=9): (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds true for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the general formula. Since each layer is defined as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nThe standard solution for such a recurrence is indeed L_n = a^n * (L_0) + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 is given, not L_0. Let me check the standard approach.\n\nActually, the standard form is for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, with L_0 given. In our case, L_1 is given as 4. So, if we adjust the formula accordingly, maybe it's better to consider n starting from 1.\n\nBut regardless, the formula I derived earlier works, as verified by the computations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to write E as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nAs I compute each layer, each time I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 3*previous +1.\n\nBut perhaps I can see the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define E_k as the expression starting from the k-th layer. So, E_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then E_2 is 1 + 3*E_1, and so on, up to E_9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(E_9). So, E_9 is the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, then each E_{k} = 1 + 3*E_{k-1}, but starting from E_1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nThis is similar to an infinite nested expression, but here it's finite, with 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, let me try to compute E_1 through E_9 using the formula I found earlier.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 = (3^5 - 1)/2\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 = (3^6 - 1)/2\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 = (3^7 - 1)/2\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 = (3^8 - 1)/2\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 = (3^9 - 1)/2\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nThat's the same result as before. So, another way to look at it is that the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2, which equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this formula. If E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is to recognize that the entire expression is (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBut let me compute 3^{11} to make sure.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} is indeed 177147.\n\nThen, 177147 - 3 = 177144.\n\nDivided by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think I've checked this enough times, and each method leads to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). \n\nFor the 9th layer, \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Hmm, I'm noticing that each layer is growing quite rapidly. Let me check my calculations so far: Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, that's right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, okay. Let's keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing all layers up to Layer 9, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any errors in my calculations. It's easy to get lost in the layers, so I should verify each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, that's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, right. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's it. I didn't skip any layers, and each step seems to follow logically. It's interesting how each layer builds on the previous one, tripling the result and adding 1 each time. It's almost like a geometric progression, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and then having 1 added. I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Maybe something like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me think about that for a moment. If I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That seems to fit the pattern we have here. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, for such a nested expression with n layers, the value would be 3*a_n, where a_n follows the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. I wonder if there's a closed-form solution for a_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try to find a pattern or perhaps solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I computed before. Therefore, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. So, the key steps were recognizing the pattern, computing each layer step by step, and then verifying the result using a formula derived from the recurrence relation. It's a bit involved, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I think I'm satisfied with this solution. It was a good exercise in working with nested expressions and recurrence relations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested expression. We compute each layer from the innermost outward:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5.

Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait a second, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me just think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. Each time, I computed each layer correctly, starting from the innermost. So, I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. This looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, to find a general formula for a_n, since this is a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the total expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3 and some terms. But since each layer is nested, it's a bit more involved, but the recurrence approach seems solid. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 1's. But that might complicate things. I think the step-by-step approach and the recurrence formula both lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

    "text": " Hmm, this seems like each layer is growing quite rapidly. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let me write down the results so far:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2: 13  \nLayer 3: 40  \nLayer 4: 121  \n\nWait, that's not quite right. Let me double-check my calculations because I think I might be making a mistake here. For Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. That's correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me proceed to Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me check if I did each step correctly because that's a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this differently. Perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard methods. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the answer should be 88572. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't want to use the formula, I could compute each layer step by step as I did before, but the formula approach seems more efficient and less error-prone. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression with repeated patterns. By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nSo, 2*10000 = 20000\n\n9*1000 = 9000\n\n5*100 = 500\n\n2*10 = 20\n\n4*1 = 4\n\nSo, 20000 + 9000 = 29000\n\n29000 + 500 = 29500\n\n29500 + 20 = 29520\n\n29520 + 4 = 29524\n\nNow, multiplying each part by 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down.

That matches my earlier calculation. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the multiplication once more because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n} + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k = 3, c = 1.\n\nSo, applying the formula:\n\na_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^n + c/(1 - k)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 1/(1 - 3)\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^n + (-1/2)\n= (4 + 1/2) * 3^n - 1/2\n= (9/2) * 3^n - 1/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (9/2)*3^1 - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Wait, but a_1 is supposed to be 4. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nWait, let me double-check the initial conditions. The first term a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nBut according to the formula, when n=1, a_1 should be 4, but according to the formula, a_1 = (9/2)*3^1 - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is not 4. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me rederive the general solution for the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when the nonhomogeneous term is zero, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to this is a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1, a_1=4.\n\nLayer 2, n=2, a_2=13.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, which would be n=9.\n\nSo, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step layer computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Wait, no. Let me look back at the original problem. It starts with 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. But in my layers above, I started with the innermost as Layer 1 and built up to Layer 9, which is the entire inner expression before the outermost 3. So, the final step would be to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm that. So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 would be the final result. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step. First, 29524 * 3.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1+3\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(...). Wait, so maybe I miscounted earlier. If the innermost is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent is another layer, so up to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3*Layer9. So, perhaps I did it correctly with 9 layers. But when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, then 3*29,524 is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I should have stopped at Layer 8 because the outermost is 3*(Layer9). Wait, let me recount the layers in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then it's closed by a ), then multiplied by 3, then added to 1, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of nested 1+3 terms. Let me try to index them:\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the 3*, there's a (1 + 3*...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each (1 + 3*(Layer n)) is Layer n+1.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1 + 3*(...\" segments:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then another (1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on until the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nSo, each time I see \"1 + 3*\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then another (1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on until the innermost (1 + 3)\n\nI think there are 9 such layers because each time you go in, you add another layer, and the expression has 9 sets of \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But I'm a bit confused because when I first started, I thought of 9 layers, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, and f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Then, the total expression would be 3*f(n). So, for n=1, f(1)=1+3=4. For n=2, f(2)=1+3*4=13. For n=3, f(3)=1+3*13=40, and so on, up to n=9. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, let me compute f(n) for n=1 to n=9.\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3*1 = 4? Wait, no, because f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), and f(1) should be the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then f(2)=1 + 3*f(1)=1 + 3*4=13. f(3)=1 + 3*f(2)=1 + 3*13=40. f(4)=1 + 3*f(3)=1 + 3*40=121. f(5)=1 + 3*f(4)=1 + 3*121=364. f(6)=1 + 3*f(5)=1 + 3*364=1093. f(7)=1 + 3*f(6)=1 + 3*1093=3280. f(8)=1 + 3*f(7)=1 + 3*3280=9841. f(9)=1 + 3*f(8)=1 + 3*9841=29524. So, f(9)=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29,524=88,572. So, that seems consistent with what I computed earlier.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning that f(n) is defined for n=1 to n=9, and then the total is 3*f(9). So, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for f(n). Since f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), this is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be f(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume f_p(n) = B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n=> B - 3B = 1\n=> -2B = 1\n=> B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n=> 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n=> A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the layers I computed. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we found earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something else. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, does that mean that the expression is 3*(f(9))? Because f(9) is the inner expression, right? So, yes, the total expression is 3*f(9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for f(n). Since f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*f(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*f(9) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144.\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 /2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me try to expand the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAnd so on, as before. But perhaps I can express this in terms of a sum.\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence, as I thought before, and we've already solved it using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it without using the formula, just by expanding each layer step by step, as I did earlier. Either way, I end up with the same result.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layer computations. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out correctly.\n\nWait, but another thought: Since each layer is a geometric progression multiplied by 3 each time, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, starting from the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))). Each time, it's 3 multiplied by a term that includes 1 plus 3 times another term. So, if I expand it all the way, it would be a sum of 3^k terms, right?\n\nWait, let me try to write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n... and so on, up to Layer9.\n\nBut when I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(Layer9). So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, when I computed Layer9 as 29,524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then 3*Layer9 is (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, 3^{11} is 177,147, so 177,147 -3 = 177,144, divided by 2 is 88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from the innermost 1.\n\nWait, let's try to expand the entire expression step by step:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand it step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum:\n\nEach time, you have 1 added, and then multiplied by 3, and so on. So, perhaps it's a sum of 3^k, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you have an expression like a + 3*(b + 3*(c + ...)), it can sometimes be represented as a geometric series. Let me try to see if that's the case here.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me denote the inner expression as S. So, S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) up to 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*S.\n\nBut S itself is 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next inner expression. Wait, but this might not directly form a geometric series, but perhaps using the formula for f(n) as we did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 3*previous + 1.\n\nBut I think I've verified it enough times. Each step seems correct, and the formula using the recurrence relation and the closed-form expression both lead to the same result.\n\nWait, another thought: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 9 layers. So, the total number of terms when expanded would be 3^9, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose I have the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(E')) where E' is the expression with n-1 layers. But this might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself, but since the number of layers is finite, it's not a true recursion but a finite nested expression.\n\nWait, maybe I can model it as a finite geometric series. Let me try to see.\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me see how many terms there are. Each layer adds another 3*... So, perhaps the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))). Wait, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the total expression as follows:\n\nEach time you have 1 + 3*(...), which is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, the innermost is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, as we computed earlier, Layer9 is 29,524, and then 3*Layer9 is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for f(n) as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and then compute 3*f(n) as (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, it's (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177,147. Then, 177,147 -3 = 177,144. Divide by 2: 177,144 /2 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times, and all methods point to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check if I did each step correctly. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1093*3, let's compute that. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me try to compute Layer 9 again: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute it differently. 29524*3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, but wait, no, the number is 29,524. Wait, actually, 29,524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, the result is 88,572. Correct. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches what I computed earlier. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, actually, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 1 is the innermost, and we have 9 layers, then Layer 9 would be a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144/2 =88572. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. So, in summary, by either computing each nested layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. But wait, that's digit-wise, but actually, we have to carry over the digits properly. Let me write it out:\n\n     29524\n   x      3\n   --------\n     88572\n\nYes, because 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 0 (since there's no more digits) so it's 8. So, 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me verify using another method. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, my earlier computations are confirmed by the closed-form formula. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost 1+3 and then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, in this case, with nine layers, the value at each layer is a geometric series. But since I already have the closed-form formula, I can use that to compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which might save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable. Let me just recap: The problem was to compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) I recognized that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which led me to model it as a recurrence relation. I found a closed-form solution for the nth layer, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the innermost layer is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, after carefully computing each step and verifying my results using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is correct. I don't think I made any errors in my calculations, but it's always good to double-check, especially with such a nested expression. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, using the formula also gives the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Because the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me calculate that. 3*29524: First, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72.

Wait, but let me double-check each step because the numbers are getting large, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through the layers again just to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere.

Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Solving such a recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute the nth term directly, without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me try that approach. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1092? Let me check: 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Yes, correct. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost operation is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but given the repeated multiplications by 3, it might be correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might relate to a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the step-by-step approach seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent L_n is defined by that recurrence. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1)). Let's compute the constant C using the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (1/(3 - 1)) => 4 = 3C + 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => C = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (7/6)*3^n + (1/2). Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 3/6 = (7/2) + (1/2) = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 3/6 = (66/6) = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated L_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, maybe my general formula is incorrect. Let me check my steps again. The standard solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is indeed L_n = C*a^n + b/(a - 1). So, plugging in a=3, b=1, we get L_n = C*3^n + 1/(3 - 1) = C*3^n + 1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3C + 1/2 => 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => C = 7/6. So, L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. But when n=2, L_n should be 13, but according to the formula: (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 3/6 = 66/6 = 11. That's not matching. Hmm, so there must be an error in my approach. Wait, perhaps the formula is for zero-based indexing, or maybe I misapplied it. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the first term is L_1 = 4, so for n=1, L_1 = 4. Let me try to compute L_2 using the formula: L_2 = (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = 63/6 + 3/6 = 66/6 = 11. But we know that L_2 is actually 13, so the formula is giving the wrong result. Therefore, my initial approach to find a closed-form solution might be flawed. Maybe I should try a different method. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm misapplying it. Let me check the recurrence again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is correct. Using the formula: L_n = C*3^n + 1/2. For n=1: 4 = C*3 + 1/2 => C= (4 - 1/2)/3 = (7/2)/3 = 7/6. For n=2: L_2 = 7/6 * 9 + 1/2 = 63/6 + 3/6 = 66/6 = 11, which is incorrect. So, the formula isn't working as expected. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is L_n = (L_1 - b/(a-1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a - 1). Let me try that. So, L_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let's test for n=1: (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (21/2) + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Still not matching L_2=13. Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe the formula isn't applicable here because the recurrence starts at n=1, not n=0. Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me try to derive the solution again. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. To solve this, we can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct! For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That makes sense now. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation. In any case, both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, the outermost operation is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, is there a pattern here? Let me see: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121... Hmm, I'm not sure if there's an obvious pattern, but maybe I should just keep computing each layer step by step. Let me continue. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, let's compute that: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, starting from 4. So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me see. If we have a recursive formula where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it that way to see if I can find a pattern or a formula, which might help verify my earlier computation. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => Subtract 3K from both sides: -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, Layer 4. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, Layer 5. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, Layer 6. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, Layer 7. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, Layer 8. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, Layer 9. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at each layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis is closed after a certain number. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses: Starting after the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses: each \"(\", so 9 layers. Therefore, the formula I used earlier with n=9 is correct, giving Layer 9 as 29524, and the total expression as 3*29524=88572. So, I think my answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, which I already solved. So, unless there's a different approach, I think the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But wait a second, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculations. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the first layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^n + (d/(c-1)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Plugging in c=3 and d=1, the solution becomes a_n = A*3^n + (1/(3-1)) = A*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 0.5 => 3A = 3.5 => A = 3.5 / 3 = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. Similarly, for n=2: a_2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 3/6 = 66/6 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13, so this is a problem. There must be an error in my general formula. Let me double-check. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the initial condition. Let me see: The standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} + d/(c-1). Wait, so maybe I should write it as a_n = (a_1 - k) * c^{n-1} + k, where k = d/(c-1). In this case, c=3, d=1, so k=1/(3-1)=1/2. Therefore, a_n = (a_1 - 1/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. Since a_1=4, then a_n = (4 - 1/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11, but wait, earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, so either my general formula is wrong, or I misapplied it. Wait, perhaps the indexing is off. Because the first term a_1 is when n=1, but the formula might be expecting n starting at 0. Alternatively, maybe I should adjust the formula. Let me try to rederive the general solution properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's write the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 3*4 +1 =13 a_3=3*13 +1=40 a_4=3*40 +1=121 a_5=3*121 +1=364 a_6=3*364 +1=1093 a_7=3*1093 +1=3280 a_8=3*3280 +1=9841 a_9=3*9841 +1=29524 Then, the expression is 3*a_9=88572. Now, to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The standard approach is to solve the linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. That's a much cleaner way to express it. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is the 9th layer, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I can see that each layer is following a pattern where each term is (3^{n} -1)/2 for the nth layer. So, in this case, the 9th layer would be (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication one more time: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. Starting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to compute 29524*3 is to break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

So, it's like each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Hmm, that seems correct. So, let me compute each layer one by one up to Layer 9.

The original problem is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the final answer would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me verify if I did each step correctly. Let me go through each layer again to check for any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, it's 3*(previous layer). So, does that mean that the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524, as I computed? Or is there a different way to interpret it?\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my approach was correct, computing each layer step by step. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, ..., Layer 9: 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where B is a particular solution. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula seems to work. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but according to the formula, a_n is already 1 + 3*(a_{n-1}), so the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) =88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula.\n\nWait, let's see. The original expression is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =4. So, E = 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*a_9 =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147\n\nTherefore, E = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try to write the expression in expanded form.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, as I did before, it's (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the layers again, just in case I made a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped. I also verified it using the formula for the linear recurrence, which gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break that down: 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4, as we saw. Hmm, this looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a geometric sequence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation to solve for A and B. Since the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can substitute the general solution into this equation. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} becomes A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation is A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, subtract 3B from both sides: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plug B = -1/2 into the initial condition equation: 4 = 3A + (-1/2). So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the outermost Layer 9. Therefore, Layer 9 = L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try expanding the expression step by step, but perhaps using the formula I just found. Since each Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I think of it as starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(4), then 1 + 3*(13), etc., up to 9 layers. Alternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that. Let me denote E as the entire expression. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me see if I can express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since it's only 9 layers, maybe it's easier to compute it as we did before, layer by layer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to write it out more explicitly. Let's denote each nested term as follows:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1s and 3s. Wait, perhaps if I expand it, I can see a pattern. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that each layer adds a power of 3. Wait, from the earlier computation, each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, with n=9, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that. Let me see, starting from the innermost term:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3^1\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 1 + 3^2 + 3^1\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. So, Layer n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1 + 1. But wait, that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier formula. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms multiplied by 3. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me recall that the sum S = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In our case, for Layer9, the sum is from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which would be (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that's consistent as well.\n\nWait, but in our problem, each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct. So, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is (3^{11} -3)/2, which is 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times. Each step seems consistent, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, is this correct? Let me double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, yes. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9. Then, we have: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...), and inside that is L9. So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, reading from the top: 8 8 5 7 2, so 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, seems correct. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks like each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*L9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\). Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the value of the outermost expression is \\(88,572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, this is getting bigger quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, let's compute that: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost operation is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, but I'm a bit confused because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems similar to a geometric series or something. Maybe there's a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that for a linear recurrence relation like this, the solution can be found using the method for solving nonhomogeneous linear recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1 = 4. For n=2: a_2 should be 13. Let's compute (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got for Layer 9 earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nBut wait, the problem is structured as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually and see if it aligns with the formula. Let's take n=4: a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Which matches what I had before. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{(Layer 9)}\\).

For \\(n = 9\\), this gives \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).

Let me compute that step by step to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, that's correct. Therefore, the total value is 88,572. Wait a second, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. But I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3. So, the numbers get big quickly. Let me try to see if there's a formula for a_n instead of computing each step, just to confirm. The recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a geometric sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's another way to write it. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, from a_1 to a_9, each time calculating a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. 3. Verified each step to ensure no arithmetic errors. 4. Then, derived a general formula for a_n using the recurrence relation, which also confirmed that a_9=29524. 5. Finally, multiplied by 3 to get the total value. So, I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is calculated step by step. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4.

After computing each layer, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to get the final value.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times.

Multiply this by 3 to get the final value:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Let me check that again. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Then 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right. Continuing to Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Hmm, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Wait, 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. That's correct. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Let me check that. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, 3*9841. Let me compute that again to be sure. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the whole expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure. 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2=8. 5*3=15, but wait, no, actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That matches what I got earlier. So, yes, the total is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait a second, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me double-check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nFrom the inside: (1+3) is the first, then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9 because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the outermost is 3 times the ninth layer. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), so the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is the innermost. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after each 3. Starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(, then inside that is another 1 + 3(, and so on. Let me count the number of 3( after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another 3(\n3. Another 3(\n4. Another 3(\n5. Another 3(\n6. Another 3(\n7. Another 3(\n8. Another 3(\n9. The innermost is 1+3.\n\nWait, so the innermost is Layer1: 1+3, then Layer2: 1+3*(Layer1), Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, I think I did compute correctly up to Layer9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from Layer1 = 4, Layer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It seems like each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric sequence.\n\nLet me denote Layer n as L_n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolve for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution was a more efficient way and reduced the chance of calculation errors.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from L_1=4.\n\nThen L_2=1 + 3*4=13.\n\nL_3=1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)=1 + 3 + 9*4=1 + 3 + 36=40.\n\nWait, that seems more complicated. Maybe using the recurrence relation was better.\n\nIn any case, both methods led me to the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirmed the results of the step-by-step computation.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because these numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, earlier I thought the final answer was 88,572, but when I added 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72, I got 88,572. But in my initial calculation, I wrote 88572, which is the same number without the comma. So, that seems correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Each layer seems to be 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I let a_n represent the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D So, we have C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, since a_1 = 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, a_2 =13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, a_3=40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, and we go up to a_9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049, 3^{11}=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each term is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next term})$.

    "text": " Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here, but let me keep going to be sure. Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step would be: Final Answer: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each layer step by step to ensure there are no errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a geometric progression perhaps? Let me think. If I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, no, actually, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each time, the expression is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, it's like 3^k + 3^{k-1} + ... + 3 + 1, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's more like a geometric progression with ratio 3, but shifted. But since we've already derived a formula using the recurrence relation, and it's consistent with the step-by-step computation, I think that's solid. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
