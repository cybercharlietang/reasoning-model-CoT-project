Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count the number of times I added a layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3, Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost. So, that's correct. Each layer corresponds to one set of parentheses. Therefore, my calculation should be accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Wait, actually, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches my earlier calculation, so it seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I used two methods: direct computation layer by layer and solving the recurrence relation. Both gave the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term.

Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1, because a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = 1. So, using n=0: a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) A + B = 1 2) 3A + B = 4 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 1: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another exponent. So, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, the outermost value before the final multiplication is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches my earlier result. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time, which fits the recurrence relation I used. So, using the closed-form formula is a much faster way, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, although it was a bit time-consuming. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, yeah, that's how I solved it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see if there's a closed-form formula for this kind of recurrence. This is a linear recurrence relation, specifically a non-homogeneous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute A. a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10 or something, but I think the way I did it is sufficient. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression, which repeats the pattern 1 + 3*(...). 2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3 = 4. 3. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). 4. Compute each layer step by step up to the 9th layer, which gives 29,524. 5. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final value, which is 88,572. 6. As a check, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, confirming that the 9th term is indeed 29,524, and thus the final result is 88,572. So, I think I've covered all the steps thoroughly and double-checked my work to ensure accuracy. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.

Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 24 becomes 24, so 24 * 3 = 72, but we have 24 as the last two digits, so actually, I think I made a mistake here.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of 1+3(1+3(...)) terms.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): There's 1+3(1+3(...)) repeated 8 times, because the innermost is just 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Wait, actually, the number of layers is 9, because each time you have a 1+3 multiplied by the next layer. So, starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), etc., up to 9 layers. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recursively defined sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the 9th term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, but since n is small (n=9), computing each term step by step is manageable.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2A\n\n=> A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n=> 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another multiplication method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, yes, 88,572 seems correct. I think I did each step correctly, so I feel confident about the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final step is to compute 3 * Layer 9. Let's do that: Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to get lost in the layers, so I'll go through each step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write down the terms again using this notation: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's the same result as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. I think this is correct, but maybe I can find a general formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step. Let's see. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition to find D. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + D => 4 = 3C + D. Now, let's consider the homogeneous solution and find a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. To find a particular solution, let's assume it's a constant, say D. Plugging into the equation: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. The expression inside out is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*something, and that something is the next layer. So, if I denote the innermost term as a base case, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, after 9 layers, it's a_9 as above, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers, and each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3*a_9. Since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result again. So, regardless of the method, I keep getting 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

So, we take the result from Layer 9 and multiply it by 3: 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's digit-wise. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572. Okay, so the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Because if any layer is wrong, the subsequent ones will be too. Let's go through each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or using a formula, but since the expression is finite and only nine layers deep, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a linear function of the previous term. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n, which might help in computing the value without having to calculate each layer manually. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check if this formula works with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3}-1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for each layer. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Using the recurrence relation formula, we confirm that the final value is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check the original expression again. The outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. The expression is a geometric sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find the closed-form expression. First, let's write the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the 9th term, n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I need to multiply this result by 3. Let's compute that: Final result = 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a more efficient way to compute this without having to go through each layer manually? Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1= A*3^{1} -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2= 9/2. So, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait a second, but when I look back at the problem, it's written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers. But when I counted from Layer 1 to Layer 9, I think I accounted for all of them. Let me confirm the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Counting the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs: Each layer adds one more. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3(1+3), Layer 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). The expression ends with ...1+3))), so the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, there are 9 layers in total. Therefore, I think my earlier calculation with 9 layers is correct, resulting in 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, L_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Okay, so each layer checks out. I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it without calculating each layer individually. Let me explore that possibility. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). There are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Let me denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking for a pattern or a recursive formula. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation. It's interesting because it shows that each a_n follows a specific pattern, which can be solved using methods for linear recurrences. This might be a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for nine layers, both methods are manageable. In summary, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3, leading to the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, we have to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20,000 is 60,000. 3 times 9,000 is 27,000. 3 times 500 is 1,500. 3 times 24 is 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, my final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a geometric series, perhaps? Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the first term is 1 + 3 = 4, which would be a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 =4, and we go up to Layer 9, which would be a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach also led me to the same answer, so I'm confident this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a nonhomogeneous one because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can think about this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. If I expand this, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand all the terms, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms, but wait, actually, the number of terms depends on the number of layers. Wait, but in our case, it's 9 layers, so maybe the expansion would involve 3^9? Let me think. Let's try to see what happens when we expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\nWait, this seems like a geometric series where each layer adds another term of 3^{n}. So, in general, layer n would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. But wait, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, that makes sense. Therefore, each layer is a partial sum of a geometric series, and the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, but let me check: the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 3^0 + 3^1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another term. So, the outermost layer would be 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Let me compute that sum: sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've checked it enough ways, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by sums.

So, the outermost layer is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, it's 88,572. Hmm, so that's correct. Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and the general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier calculations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, we can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula directly, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Let me break this down: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so actually, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. So, the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, and a_{n}=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides, we get B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. Good. Let's check n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's right. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe there's a formula for such a series. Let me recall that for a geometric series, the sum can be expressed as a(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), but in this case, each term is not just multiplied by a common ratio but also has an added 1. Hmm, perhaps it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote each Layer n as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. I think the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it that way to see if I can find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both the iterative step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we can systematically compute each step.

Wait, no, let me check. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost part is Layer 1. Wait, when I started, I considered Layer 1 as the innermost, but perhaps the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm. Let me count the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(...\" adds a new layer. So starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let me do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high, but I think it's correct. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 again: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 + 9524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, then each 1+3( adds another. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3( until the outermost. So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought. So, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, the answer should be 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute it again, perhaps using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from n=3, each time we compute the next layer as 1 + 3n. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3*1=4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, etc. Wait, but in this problem, the innermost is actually 1 + 3, which is 4, as I did before. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, for k >=2.\n\nSo, we have L_1=4,\n\nL_2=1 + 3*4=13,\n\nL_3=1 + 3*13=40,\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nNow, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_k. Let's see, the recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving L_k - 3L_{k-1}=0, which has the solution L_k^{(h)} = C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3L_p =1 => -2L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C=4 + 1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_k= (3/2)*3^k - 1/2= (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_k= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the formula. Let me check 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. So, yes, L_9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the total expression without using the formula, just by multiplying each layer step by step, to confirm. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a different approach, such as expanding the expression step by step without layers, but that might be more complicated. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to compute the innermost part first and work my way out. Starting from the innermost 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nNext layer:1 + 3*13=40.\n\nThen:1 + 3*40=121.\n\nThen:1 + 3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nThen:1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nThen:1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nFinally, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the method, I arrive at the same result.\n\nI think I can conclude that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

So, 90,000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3 is 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. I think that makes sense.

Let me compute 3*364 again. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. All right, I think that's solid. So, I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a minute. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. Wait, actually, 9841 is 9000 + 841. So 3*9841 = 3*(9000 + 841) = 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but wait, that seems really large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the inside: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Let's see, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of layers. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does 1 + 3*(... occur? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time you go out, you add another layer, and there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, yes, 9 layers. So, the computation up to Layer 9 is correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9, and then the total is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. Let's see, if a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms using the formula. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But wait, in our case, a_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe my formula is off. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with such large exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2. Let me compute 243*243: 200*200=40000, 200*43=8600, 43*200=8600, 43*43=1849. Wait, that's not the right way to compute 243*243. Let me do it properly: 243 * 243. Let's compute 243*200=48600, 243*40=9720, 243*3=729. Now, add them together: 48600 + 9720 = 58320; 58320 + 729 = 59049. Yes, correct. So, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Adding them: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Now, solve for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.

Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So yes, that gives 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. I think that's correct. Each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric progression, actually. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, maybe there's a formula for such a series. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a_n is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous part is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Now, in our problem, Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, giving 4. Layer 2 is n=2, giving 13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*a_9. Let me see if I can express this as a formula. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Which is the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the geometric series. That's reassuring because both methods give the same answer. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,572. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step follows logically, and the formula checks out with the manual computation. So, I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again to ensure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let me write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern here. Let me compute the ratio between consecutive terms to see if it's a geometric sequence or something else.\n\na_2 / a_1 = 13 / 4 \u2248 3.25\na_3 / a_2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077\na_4 / a_3 = 121 / 40 \u2248 3.025\na_5 / a_4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\na_6 / a_5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\na_7 / a_6 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000\na_8 / a_7 = 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000\na_9 / a_8 = 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nWait a minute, after a certain point, the ratio becomes exactly 3. That's interesting. So, perhaps after the first few terms, the ratio approaches 3. Let me see: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I rearrange this, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the general formula would be:\n\na_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nBut wait, in our case, the recurrence starts at a_1 = 4. Let me check the initial condition. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let's see what the formula gives us:\n\na_1 = 3^1 * a_0 + (3^1 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1\n\nBut a_1 is given as 4, so:\n\n3*a_0 + 1 = 4 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1\n\nSo, the initial condition a_0 = 1. Therefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = 3^n * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nLet me simplify this:\n\na_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the known values to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, a_2=13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, a_4=121.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, from a_1 to a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} first.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and using the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers, leading to the final value before multiplying by the outermost 3. Using a recursive formula, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it down more carefully: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost operation: 3*29524.

Yes, that's the same result. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct.

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. But wait, let me confirm by calculating each step again just to be sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) + b/(1 - a). Hmm, I might have messed up the exact formula, but the idea is that it's a geometric series. Let me try to compute the first few terms and see if I can find a pattern. L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I write this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, expanding this, L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}. Continuing this way, recursively, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_1. Wait, but L_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, expanding L_n, we get:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L_{n-3})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_{n-3}\n...\nContinuing this way, after n-1 steps, we get:\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_1\n\nSince L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, plugging that in:\n\nL_n = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}) + 3^n*(1 + 3)\n= (sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k) + 3^n*(4)\n\nThe sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k is a geometric series, which equals (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n\n= (3^n - 1)/2 + (8*3^n)/2\n= [3^n - 1 + 8*3^n]/2\n= (9*3^n - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that algebra again. Let's compute (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n:\n\nFirst, express 4*3^n as (8*3^n)/2 to have a common denominator.\n\nSo, (3^n - 1)/2 + (8*3^n)/2 = [3^n - 1 + 8*3^n]/2 = [9*3^n - 1]/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, L_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 should be 4. Plugging n=1 into the formula:\n\n(9*3^1 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. But L_1 is 4, not 13. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my formula must be incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nExpanding L_2:\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nIf I try to express L_n in terms of L_1, perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me compute L_1, L_2, L_3, etc., and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4\nL_2 = 13\nL_3 = 40\nL_4 = 121\nL_5 = 364\nL_6 = 1093\nL_7 = 3280\nL_8 = 9841\nL_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. Indeed, 4*3=12, plus 1 is 13; 13*3=39, plus 1 is 40; 40*3=120, plus 1 is 121, and so on. So, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is the same as 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, the standard solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D + 1\nD - 3D = 1\n-2D = 1\nD = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\n(3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that with the formula. Since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, so computing the final value as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 would have been faster, but since I was unsure at first, I did the step-by-step computation, which was a good way to verify.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, leading up to the 9th layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Layer:**\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because 29,524 * 3 might be miscalculated. Let me compute it step by step: 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 30,000 *3 is 90,000, so 29,524 *3 should be just a bit less than that, which 88,572 is. Hmm, actually, let me verify with another method. 29,524 *3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 +29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). But when I computed Layer 9, it's already 1 +3*Layer8, which is 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. At n=1: a_1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. At n=0: Wait, n starts at 1, so maybe it's better to express it differently. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p -3a_p =1 => -2a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, let's compute that: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, that might not be the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but I think I'm mixing up the digits.

So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...), so from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yeah, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. I think that makes sense. Each time, the numbers are growing exponentially because each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression, maybe? Let me think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. If I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, for n layers, the value is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Let's assume a_n = C*3^n + D. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, a_n = C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Comparing both sides, we get: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote a_n as the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging n=2 into the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 9A + B = 13 (from n=2) Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 =3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the result is 88,572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3, leading to the solution 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
