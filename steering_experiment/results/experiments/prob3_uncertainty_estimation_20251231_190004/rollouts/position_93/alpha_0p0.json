    "text": " Let me denote the innermost expression as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built upon the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find D. Setting a_n = C*3^n + D. Substitute into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, left side: C*3^n + D. Right side: 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation.

The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. So, the general solution would be a_n = (a_1 + (1)/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - (1)/(3-1). Let me plug in the values. Here, a_1 = 4. So, a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^2 -1/2 = (9/2)*9 -1/2 = 81/2 -1/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} -1/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561: 6561 *9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So 54000 + 4500 = 58500, +540=59040, +9=59049. So, (9/2)*6561=59049/2=29524.5. Then subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5=29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is a geometric progression, but since I already solved it step by step and verified with the formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and verifying with a geometric series formula, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Setting a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = C*3^k + D, where C and D are constants. Let's find C and D. When k=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D = 3C + D. When k=0, but wait, a_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = C*3^k. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_k^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2.

    "text": " The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 8 layers inside. Wait, actually, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...). The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...). There's one at each level. So from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). So each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So with 9 layers, as I computed before. So each layer is defined recursively as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. So it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, no. Wait, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So yes, using the formula, I also arrive at the same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": " Suppose we have a general expression like a(1 + b(1 + b(1 + b(...)))), n times. Then, each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L_k as the value at layer k. Then, L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for L_n is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3 L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation formula. That's pretty neat because it allows us to compute the value without having to manually compute each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work fine. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, I arrived at the value of 29524 for the innermost part, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify one more time with the formula approach. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems solid. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, computing each layer step by step would still lead me to the same result, albeit more time-consuming.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it to see if we can find a formula. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + D => 4 = 3C + D. Also, since the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant D, we can solve for D by setting n=0, but wait, our first term is n=1. Alternatively, let's solve for D. Assume steady state: a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Then, D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Plugging into the equation: k = 1 + 3k => k - 3k = 1 => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me compute a few terms using the formula. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me try to solve the recurrence properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * (a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, in this case, a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. So, r = 3, c = 1.

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). This is similar to a continued fraction or a nested multiplication. In general, for such expressions, if there are n layers, each of the form x = 1 + 3x, but wait, that's only when it's infinitely nested, but here it's finite. Wait, actually, each layer is x_{k} = 1 + 3x_{k-1}, starting from x_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to express it as such. Let x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1} for n = 2 to 9. So, we can compute each x_n step by step. Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, x_1 = 4, x_2 = 13, x_3=40, x_4=121, x_5=364, x_6=1093, x_7=3280, x_8=9841, x_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for x_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1} with x_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution x_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition x_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: x_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: x_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, x_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, x_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute this without using the recurrence relation, I would still get the same result by computing each layer step by step. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)) directly using the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...).

Alternatively, the general formula for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.
