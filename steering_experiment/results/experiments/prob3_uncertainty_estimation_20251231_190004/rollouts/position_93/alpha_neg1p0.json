The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Alternatively, I can see that each a_n can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's assume the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Then, the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = D. Plugging into the equation: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just check once more for any possible arithmetic errors. When I computed each layer, I went step by step and each time, the result was correct.

Alternatively, is there a formula for L_n? Let's see. Each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing this to the general solution a_n = A*3^n + B, we get: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, the general formula for such expressions is known. Each time you have a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*(next term), it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. The formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, gives the value after n layers. Therefore, using this formula is a more efficient way than computing each layer step by step, especially if n were larger. But since n=9 here, both methods work. So, to recap: Each layer adds another power of 3, and the formula neatly captures that. Therefore, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a series, we determine the value after nine layers and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? Let me check. Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, but when I defined E(n), I might have misapplied it. Let me clarify. Let me define E(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, for example, E(1) would be 1 + 3, but in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), but the entire expression is 3*(...). So maybe E(n) is the inner part, and the total expression is 3*E(n). Let me redefine: Let E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*E(9).

So, the earlier approach was correct, and the alternative approach where I tried to define E(n) as 3*(1 + E(n-1)) was perhaps misaligned because the total expression is 3*E(9), where E(n) is defined as 1 + 3*E(n-1). So, I think my initial computation is correct, and the answer is 88572. To be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure no arithmetic errors: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 +12=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. Using the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, actually, let me think: the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, we could have computed a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. That might have saved time, but since I didn't think of it initially, I went through each layer. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a few layers quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. I think I'm good. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers, we find the value of the innermost expression, multiply it by 3, and arrive at the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from 1, each time we do 1 + 3*(previous result). So, this is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't use the formula, just computing each layer step by step also leads to the same result.

So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each is straightforward. The formula for a geometric series with a common ratio might apply here. Let me think about it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_k. Let me try to find a recursive formula. The recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = A*3^k. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_k^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition at k=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Wait, 29524 is 2*10000 +9*1000 +5*100 +2*10 +4*1. So, 2*10000=20000, 9*1000=9000, 5*100=500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4. So, 20000 + 9000 =29000, +500=29500, +20=29520, +4=29524. So, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula.

Then the final result is 3*a_9. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2 = (59049/2) - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result.

Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = ( (3^n - 1) ) / (3 - 1) ) * something? Wait, let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^n * a_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/2, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, actually, the standard solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Here, k=3, c=1. So, if we start with a_0 = 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4), then a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, but let me check that. Let's see, for n=1: a_1 = 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 13. Formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=40. Formula: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the geometric series. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, and it helps to verify that the formula works. So, to recap, I started from the innermost layer, computed each subsequent layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and after reaching the outermost layer, multiplied by 3 again to get the final result.

Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the expression given in the problem is 3*a_9. So, if I can compute a_9, then multiply by 3, I get the answer. To solve this recurrence relation, I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Now, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Let's solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be found using standard techniques. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric sequence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, yes, that's the same result as before. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested structure. Let me think. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the problem is solved by computing each nested layer step by step, recognizing the pattern, and then using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.
