So, a_9 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. For example, let's take a smaller number of layers, say 2 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Compute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Then 3*a_2 = 39. Which is correct. So the formula works for n=2. Let's try n=1: 3(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Using the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Then 3*a_1 = 12. Correct again. So, the formula seems to hold, which gives me more confidence that for n=9, the result is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form expression \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count how many times \"1+3(...)\" occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is written: Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, a_9 is the innermost expression, and then multiplied by 3. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with 9 threes. So, S = 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just verify the arithmetic one more time to be sure. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no. 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1. So, 2*10000=20000, 9*1000=9000, 5*100=500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4. So, 20000 + 9000 = 29000, +500=29500, +20=29520, +4=29524. So, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that adds up correctly.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression with ratio 3, and the closed-form formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, after 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final value before multiplication by 3. Using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
