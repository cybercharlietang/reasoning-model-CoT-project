Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me expand it step by step, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can see the pattern in the numbers I got earlier: Layer 1: 4 = (3^2 + 1)/1? Wait, 4 = 3 + 1, which is 3^1 + 1. Layer 2: 13 = 3^3 - 2? Wait, 3^3 = 27, 27 -14=13? Maybe not. Alternatively, let's see the values: Layer 1: 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2? (9 -1)/2=4, yes. Layer 2: 13. Let's see: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=13, yes. Layer 3: 40. (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, yes. Layer 4: 121. (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. So, 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just check once more by computing the layers again to be thorough. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40 Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121 Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364 Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093 Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572.

Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, so adding 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them: Starting from the innermost, each time we see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"(\", each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of layers: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the innermost. Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1) Then Layer3: 1 + 3(Layer2), etc., until Layer9: 1 + 3(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using both methods and see if they match. Let's check Layer 2: Using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Using the closed-form: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Closed-form: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40=121 Closed-form: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the closed-form formula works, which gives me confidence that a_9=29524 is correct, and then 3*29524=88572 is the final answer. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.
