That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by adding 29,524 three times:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, in my previous calculation, I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1,093 is 3,279. Then 3,279 + 1 is 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3,280 = 9,840. 9,840 +1 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9,841 = 29,523. 29,523 +1 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with more layers.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, for n from 1 to 9, we can compute a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before when computing layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88,572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a couple of layers using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 and see if it matches my previous computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, all layers up to n=9 give the same results as my step-by-step computation, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final step is: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572.

Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, it's 88,572. Hmm, wait a minute, let me check my calculations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Wait, but when I write 3*29524, let me compute it again step by step to be absolutely sure. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but when I was computing Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check Layer 8 again: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9841*3. 1*3=3, 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2. 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2. There's no more digits, so write down 29. So, 9841*3=29,523. Then add 1: 29,523 +1=29,524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524. Then 3*29,524=88,572. Wait, but when I computed 29,524*3 earlier, I got 88,572. Let me do it another way to confirm. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that. Let's count: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, the expression is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(...), so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \nSo, starting from the first 3, each ( is a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have (1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( adds a layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. So, I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each computed step by step as above. So, my calculations seem correct, leading to 88,572 as the final answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\nFinal: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572  \n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's compute that: Total = 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29000 * 3 = 87000, 524 * 3 = 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but let me check another way. Maybe using another approach or seeing if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with recursion. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Hmm, let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 3*3=9 +2=11. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 3*3=9 +2=11, write down 11. So, putting it all together: 11 7 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572. Let me confirm with a different method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems correct. Let me double-check a couple of the layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1093*3: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Then, the final step is 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression seems to be of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but in a nested form. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, the nth term can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1: a_1= A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2. So, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost, I arrived at the value 29524 for the innermost expression, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula, I arrived at the same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, as both approaches led me to the same result, and I double-checked the arithmetic in each step. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is up to Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 29524 * 3. I can compute this step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524 *3 = 88572.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, n3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. I notice that each layer is following a recurrence relation: n_{k} = 1 + 3*n_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for n_k. The general solution for such a recurrence is n_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. We have n_{k} = 3*n_{k-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is n_h = A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume n_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is n_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition n1 = 4 when k=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we've already computed. For k=1: n1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For k=2: n2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For k=3: n3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. For k=4: n4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer k=9, n9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, n9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*n9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps and even double-checked using a different method, so I'm pretty sure this is right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Okay, that checks out.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider an alternative approach. This seems like a recursive expression where each term is defined as a function of the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.

Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula for a_n, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final step is: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, actually, that might not be the best way.

Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6.

Wait, no. Let me check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524.

Let me do that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it resembles a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f That matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f That's correct too. So, the general formula for the nth layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognized the nested structure of the expression. 2. Started computing from the innermost parentheses, layer by layer. 3. Noticing the recurrence relation, derived a general formula for each layer. 4. Used the formula to find the value of the outermost layer. 5. Multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Each step seems logical and checks out. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 is definitely 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 is 1 + 12, which is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 is 1 + 39, which is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 is 1 + 120, which is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360 and 1*3=3, so total is 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric series, but since each term is dependent on the previous one, it's more like a recursive sequence. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula to compute this without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can express this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given a_1 = 4, and the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Plugging into the general solution: a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating the two expressions for a_n: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Solving it using the method for such equations gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no. Let me check. The outermost part is 3*(...). So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). But let me confirm the structure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, each layer is inside another 1 + 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost, we have to go back up each layer, computing each step. Wait, no, I think I miscounted. Let me recount the layers properly. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the 9th layer from the outside. Wait, perhaps I should number them differently. Let me try again, starting from the innermost. The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then, moving outwards, each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Because the outermost part is 3*(1 + ...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Wait, but let me check the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, the layers go up to 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, so the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me confirm each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Then 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so each layer corresponds to one of them. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous) +1. So, 9 layers in total, and then the outermost 3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, each time, we're adding another 3*(...) +1. So, yes, 9 layers, each adding a new 3*(...) +1. So, the final result is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the number of layers can be tricky. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can write a general formula for such expressions. Let's say that each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4; n=2: a2=1+3*4=13; n=3: a3=1+3*13=40; and so on up to n=9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, with a9=29524, then 3*a9=88572. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Setting a_n = C, then C = 1 + 3*C, which gives C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula, a9=29524, so 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the calculations seem consistent. I didn't make any arithmetic errors that I can see. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

It's easy to get lost with so many layers. Let's go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: iterative computation and using the closed-form formula.

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that all checks out.\n\nI guess another way to approach this problem is by recognizing a pattern or perhaps using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. However, if there were more layers, it might be more efficient to find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this method also gives the same result, which confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nI think this problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing recurrence relations. It also shows how useful it is to find patterns and derive formulas to simplify computations, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nesting. If I had to compute, say, 20 layers, doing it step by step would be tedious, but with the formula, it would be straightforward. However, in this case, since there are only nine layers, either method works fine.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's solid.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively scaling the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is exactly the recurrence relation we saw earlier. It's interesting how these kinds of expressions grow exponentially because of the multiplicative factor. So, each additional layer increases the value significantly, which is why even with just nine layers, the number gets quite large.\n\nI wonder if there's a connection to geometric series here. Let me think. The formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, resembles the sum of a geometric series. Indeed, the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 would be similar. In this case, the recurrence builds up the series in reverse, starting from the innermost term and working outward, which is why the formula ends up being a function of 3^{n+1}.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that if we were to express the entire expression without the outermost 3, it would be a_n = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which is the value just before the final multiplication by 3. So, the structure of the problem is designed in such a way that each layer encapsulates the next, building up the value exponentially.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into manageable layers and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value step by step and then verify it using a derived formula. This approach not only solves the problem but also provides a deeper understanding of how nested expressions like this one work.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and use it to compute the next, continuing until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for such a sequence. Let's consider the general form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, as we computed. So, let's see if there's a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so maybe we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4, and we have 9 layers in total. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that's consistent with my earlier result. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula is a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I think I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a\u2099, which might make computing the 9th term easier. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is: a\u2099 = 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is: a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is: a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a\u2081=4: 4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Therefore, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a\u2089, we have: a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^(9+1)=3^10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think this confirms my initial calculation. It's reassuring to see that both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.

I can also verify this by considering that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps there's a formula for it, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach gives the same result. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.

Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct.

Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct. So 3*29524=88572.

So, yes, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I just thought of something. Did I count the layers correctly? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time there's a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count the number of times I see a \"1+3(\" or \"1+3\". Let me see: The innermost is 1+3), then moving out, each time it's 1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears. Each layer has a 1+3(...). So, let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, the number of layers is 9, because there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me check that. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. So, the number of layers is 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, my calculation seems accurate. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that work? Let me compute it step by step. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Compute innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Correct. Alternatively, if I compute it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my approach works for a smaller version, so it's likely correct for the larger one. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, because the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1=4. Then, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 12=13, which matches what I did earlier. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see if I can find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)}=C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)}=A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both methods confirm that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each layer was computed step by step, and each time I multiplied by 3 and added 1, which follows the pattern of the expression given. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let's do it step by step: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, this confirms that the result is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer adds another factor of 3. Let's expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote the innermost term as S_1 =1 +3.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: S_2 =1 +3*S_1 =1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nThen, S_3=1 +3*S_2=1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nSimilarly, S_4=1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nWait, but I already did this earlier. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))))). Let me try to express this as a sum. Let me define the expression as E = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))))). Let me expand this step by step. E =3*(1 +3*A), where A is the next layer: A=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))).\n\nWait, this seems similar to the earlier approach. Alternatively, maybe I can represent E as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time we have a 1 added and then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps each layer contributes a term like 3^k.\n\nLet me try to write out the expansion.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as a sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +...+3^9, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, let's see: Let me consider the expression E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). If I let x be the innermost expression, then E=3*(1 +3x). But x itself is similar, so perhaps it's a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 +3*something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but starting from k=0 up to k=9, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time we have a term that is 1 +3*(something). If I let the something be the next layer, then each layer is 1 +3*next_layer.\n\nIf I keep expanding, eventually, the innermost term is 1 +3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is (3^{n} +1)/2 or something like that, but I think the earlier approach using the closed-form formula is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, since I've already computed each layer step by step and arrived at the final answer of 88,572, and confirmed it using the closed-form formula, I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 +3=4.\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result: 1 +3*(previous result).\n\n3. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524.\n\n4. Multiply this by 3 to get the final result: 88,572.\n\nI don't see any errors in this reasoning, so I think this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a minute. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any step. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. We need to compute up to L_9 and then multiply by 3. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, a = 3, b = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Wait, hold on, actually, L_1 is the first layer. Let me clarify: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 =3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any calculation errors, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation gave me the same result.
