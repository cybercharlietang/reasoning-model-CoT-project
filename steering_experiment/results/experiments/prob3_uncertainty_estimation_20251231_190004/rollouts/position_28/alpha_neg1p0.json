    "text": " Layer 5 is 364. Wait, let me check that again. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, maybe that's too confusing. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe a better approach is to write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next.

    "text": " Layer 5 is getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Wait, let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, it's 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3 inside: 1. 3(1+3(...)) - that's the first layer inside. Then each subsequent (1+3 adds another. Let me count the number of (1+3 after the initial 3: 1. After the first 3, there are 8 more (1+3 expressions. Wait, let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first innermost is the last (1+3), which is Layer 1. Then each preceding (1+3 adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3 expressions: 1. The first 3 is outside, then the first (1+3 is Layer 1, then each (1+3 inside that is another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let me count the number of closing parentheses: Each (1+3 has a corresponding ). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then moving outward, each (1+3 adds a layer. So, the expression has 9 layers of (1+3. Wait, let me check: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Each (1+3 is followed by another (1+3 until the last one is (1+3), which is Layer 1. Then each preceding (1+3 is another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. I think I've got it right. Just to recap, the key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, computing each layer one by one. Each time, it's a matter of multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process nine times and then multiplying the final result by 3 gives the total. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable. I don't think I made any mistakes this time, but it's always good to double-check, especially with so many layers involved.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 5 is 364. Hmm, okay, moving on. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows: 29524*3 = (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I could recognize to make it quicker. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 =4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2. So, C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. Just to recap, the key was recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation and then using the formula to compute the nth term without having to compute each layer manually, although in this case, since it's only 9 layers, doing it manually wasn't too bad. But for larger n, the formula would be much more efficient. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the nth term of the sequence. \n\nUsing the formula for the nth layer:\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor the innermost layer (n=1):\n\\[ L_1 = \\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = 4 \\]\n\nProceeding to the outermost layer (n=9):\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3.

So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3.

So, putting it all together, we get 88,572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that would throw off the final answer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, the innermost layer, which we called Layer 1, corresponds to n=1, and the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, corresponds to n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But knowing the general formula is useful for larger numbers of layers. In this case, though, since it's only 9 layers, the step-by-step approach works fine. So, to recap: I started by computing the innermost parentheses and worked my way outward, calculating each layer step by step. Then, I verified my calculations by using a recurrence relation approach, which confirmed that my step-by-step answer was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. Finally, the entire result is multiplied by 3. Using this method, the final answer is calculated to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, actually, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me make sure. Each layer is inside another 3*(...). So, if Layer 9 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps I need to think of each layer as being built by starting from the innermost and working outward. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the labeling. Let me try again.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach, but I think this is solid.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, actually, that might be a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2:1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer 4:1+3*40=121, Layer 5:1+3*121=364, Layer 6:1+3*364=1093, Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's nine layers, each computed correctly. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, that's right. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, yes. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, that's right. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, yes. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems to add up. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplifying the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, setting both sides equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so the total sum is a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see: The innermost term is 4, then 13, then 40, etc. But perhaps it's better to model the entire expression as a sum. Wait, another way: Let's consider the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we have a term that's 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But actually, that's not directly helpful because S would be equal to 3*(1 + S'), where S' is the next layer. But in this case, since the layers are finite (nine layers), perhaps it's better to model it as a finite geometric series. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 =4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 +3*13=40, etc., up to nine layers. So, the nth term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. As I did earlier, so the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me check: For n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, correct. For n=2, (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. So, yes, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculations. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: Each time we have 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus 3 times another term, which can be expanded as 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, let's try expanding the expression step by step to see if that's the case. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost as E1=1+3=4. Then, E2=1+3*E1=1+3*4=13. E3=1+3*E2=1+3*13=40. E4=1+3*40=121. E5=1+3*121=364. E6=1+3*364=1093. E7=1+3*1093=3280. E8=1+3*3280=9841. E9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, if I think about the expansion, each E_n is 1 +3*E_{n-1}, so E_n =1 +3E_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, as I thought earlier, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is E_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B =1 +3B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition E_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, E_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, E_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*E_9=3*29524=88572. So, all these methods lead me to the same answer, which is 88,572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, I can compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Wait, hold on, earlier I had 3*364=1092, so 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. All steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The closed-form solution confirms that each layer's value is a term in a geometric series. After calculating each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. So, Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.

So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the original expression is 3 times the entire nested parentheses, which we've now computed up to Layer 9 being 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12.

So, the final computation is: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 equals 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers to make sure. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's see: 1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n10. ...1 + 3)))))))))) Wait, no, actually, each layer is one more set of parentheses. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the expression has nine layers because there are nine sets of \"1 + 3(\" before the last closing parentheses. Therefore, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, so the final result is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step. Let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, which is 29,524 * 3. Let me compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can do it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again in a different way, perhaps using a different method or verifying with another approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used for such nested expressions, which might help cross-verify the result.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n.\n\nThis kind of recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using methods for linear recurrences. The general form is:\n\nLayer n = a * Layer n-1 + b\n\nIn this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is given by:\n\nLayer n = a^n * Layer 0 + b * (a^n - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nWhere Layer 0 would be the initial term. Wait, in our case, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4. So, maybe we can adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, since Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 13, Layer 3 = 40, etc., perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see that each Layer n = 3*Layer n-1 + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution involves finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nLayer p = 3*Layer p + 1\n\nSolving for Layer p:\n\nLayer p - 3*Layer p = 1 => -2*Layer p = 1 => Layer p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, our first layer is Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, Layer 1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nLayer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: Layer 1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: Layer 2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: Layer 3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the result we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same number, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(previous term), it's similar to a geometric series but with a multiplier. The formula we derived is a standard approach for such linear recursions, so it's a reliable method.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, 3^10 is indeed 59,049. Then, subtracting 1 gives 59,048, and dividing by 2 gives 29,524. Multiply that by 3, and we get 88,572.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly. Each step makes sense, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Using the closed-form formula Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, we compute Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure with nine layers.\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given the way it's nested, working from the inside out seems the most straightforward method. Another way to approach it might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let me count the number of 1+3(...): There's one 1+3 at the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another. So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we have another layer. The total number of layers is 9 because there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2: 1 +3*(layer1). Up to layer 9: 1 +3*(layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_n = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier for layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, the sequence grows exponentially, specifically by a factor of 3 each time, minus a constant. But in this case, since we've already derived a closed-form formula, it's more efficient to use that. So, in summary, by either iteratively computing each layer from the inside out or by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, we arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating step by step or using the derived formula both lead to the same result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, I computed each layer correctly, but perhaps I missed a layer? Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each next layer wraps around that. So, 9 layers in total. So, I think I did compute all 9 layers correctly. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from the innermost layer). This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. Then, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. Correct. Similarly, a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.

    "text": " Layer 5: Hmm, wait, let me check that again. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yeah, that seems right. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence. So, the layers I computed earlier correspond to a_1, a_2, ..., a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4/2) - 1/2 = (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've got it. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer manually or finding a formula for the sequence, which made the calculation much faster and reduced the chance of error.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 29,000 is 87,000. Then, 3 * 524 is 1,572. Adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the value of the nth layer as a_n, then the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as we computed. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's count. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each set of parentheses adds a layer. Starting from the innermost 1+3, which is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are 9 sets: each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Wait, actually, let me check: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+\" is a new layer. Therefore, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, the value of the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer we got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I used two methods: computing each layer step by step and then deriving a general formula using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3280 * 3 is 9840. So, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let's do that step by step: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).

So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I calculated earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is calculated step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, the value of each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 5 is 364. Hmm, okay, so each layer is getting significantly larger. Let me keep going. Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Well, 3 times 29,524. Let me compute that step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Finally, 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps, because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent ones will all be wrong. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear difference equations. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we can break it down starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3. Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Hmm, let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think I might have missed that last step. Let me confirm. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested parentheses. So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check for any mistakes. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since it's nested, maybe there's a formula for it. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

Wait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see the results again: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed each layer manually, I got to 29524 for Layer 9, and then 3*29524 is 88572. But I want to make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me check one more layer with the formula. Let's take n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches. Similarly, n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can confidently say that the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've got it right. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing a recursive pattern.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me do that: Final result: 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for geometric series or something like that. Wait a second, this expression is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the nth term. If I can model this as a geometric series, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's see. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute n=1 into the equation: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. And since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, we can set up the equation: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plugging back into the initial condition: 3A + B = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Let's simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which is the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's the right approach. I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step. Each layer was 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, which built up exponentially. It's a bit tedious, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. I can see how this might be a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine terms, computing each step was feasible. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Maybe something like a recurrence relation? Let's see: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps I can solve it as a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c=3, d=1. The solution would be a_n = A*3^n + (d)/(1 - c), but since c=3>1, it's a divergent series. Wait, let me recall the formula for the solution. For a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + m, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + m/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - m/(1 - k). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + (m)/(1 - k)) * k^{n} - (m)/(1 - k). Hmm, perhaps I should derive it. Let me try to solve the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but wait, actually, our initial term is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. So, plugging n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That's pretty cool. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allows us to find a closed-form solution, which can save time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods are manageable. I think I've got the correct answer here, 88572. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me verify Layer 9 again because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let's recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Well, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29524*3 = (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. So total is 87000 + 1572 = 88572.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let's go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying 29524 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Hmm, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers. Compute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost layer: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, let's compute it step by step: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that's different. Wait, I think I messed up my smaller example. Let me recast it properly. Let me take the expression with three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. So, the result is 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the pattern seems to hold. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, in the original problem, we have nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, with each layer, the number grows exponentially, which is why the final result is so large. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3, let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. So, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. The innermost term is 4, then each subsequent term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's substitute into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1, which gives B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, which gives a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. Then Layer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13, which also matches. Similarly, Layer 3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, the value at Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula was a more efficient way to compute the result, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad either. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern can lead to a quicker solution. Anyway, I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step.

Finally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 29524: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, to confirm the answer. I remember that expressions like 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1, r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I need to adjust for the initial condition. Wait, let's think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me think again. The problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and I worked from the innermost parentheses outwards, computing each layer step by step. Is there another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c))*(c)^{n-1} + d/(1 - c). Wait, but in this case, c=3, which is greater than 1, so the denominator becomes 1 - 3 = -2. Let me plug in the values. a_1 = 4. The solution would be a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplify: 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, a_n = (4 - (-1/2))*(3)^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*(3)^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*(3)^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*(3)^1 - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*(3)^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (9/2)*27 -1/2 = 243/2 -1/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: a_9 = (9/2)*(3)^8 -1/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^8. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561. 6561*9: 6000*9=54,000, 500*9=4,500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54,000 +4,500=58,500 +540=59,040 +9=59,049. Then, 59,049 /2 =29,524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29,524.5 -0.5=29,524. So, a_9=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I approached it step by step, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer, which is similar to the recurrence relation for a geometric progression. Let me see if that approach works. Let's denote the nth term as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Hmm, actually, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9, which I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a term in a geometric progression, and the total expression is the sum of a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit more involved. But using the recurrence relation approach, I was able to find a closed-form expression, which made it easier to compute the 9th term without having to calculate each layer individually. However, since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each step was feasible without too much trouble. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

So, Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to verify. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have multiple layers, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is correct. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. If I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might help in computing it without going through each layer. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, I'll recount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, yes, a_9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).
