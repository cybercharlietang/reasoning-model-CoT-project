    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, let me count the digits correctly. 29524 has five digits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, it's 88572. Wait, but let me check using another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all the layers I computed earlier because if any of those layers were wrong, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. I think my process is right. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the method works. Let's say we have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute that step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, if I compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the method works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying it to the larger problem should be correct. Another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is following a geometric series or some recursive pattern. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, the sequence would be:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer and working outwards, each layer's value is computed and used in the next. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute 29524*3 another way: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in computing the layers. Let me double-check each layer because it's easy to make an arithmetic error in such a long chain. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n1=1+3=4, n2=1+3*4=13, n3=1+3*13=40, etc. It seems like each term is following a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let's see. Let me denote L_k as the value of the kth layer. So, L_1=1+3=4. L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k >=2. So, we have a linear recurrence relation: L_k = 3*L_{k-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3L_{k-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but in our earlier computation, we had L_9=29524. Let's see if that matches. Compute (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous term). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think my calculations are correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that again. Maybe I should do it step by step without breaking it down too much. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it out: 8 (from the last digit) 7 7 8 5 2 2, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake in the order. Let me write it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, the number is 29524, which is 5 digits: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carry 2 would be written as 2, but wait, actually, the number is 29524, so after the 2, we're done. So the result should be 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000; 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000; 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500; 20 \u00d7 3 = 60; 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think I did that correctly. But just to be thorough, let me compute each step again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nWait, let me recall. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n goes from 1 to 9. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote the innermost term as x, then the next term is 1 + 3x, and so on. But since there are nine layers, it's a bit involved, but the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, repeated nine times, starting from 1. So, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) nine times. Which is similar to the expression (3^{n} - 1)/2, which we saw earlier.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find the general term \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), this gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted or made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me recount the layers: The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a general formula. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2.

Also, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which implies that the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can set a_n = B = 1 + 3*B, which gives B = 1 + 3B \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Then, using a_1 = 4 = 3A + (-1/2) \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a geometric progression. The first term is 4, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form (3^{n} -1)/2, but I think the way I did it step by step is clearer for someone just starting out. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carryover 1 is 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.

Next: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct. Wait, but let me check if I correctly computed Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, that seems like a big number. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this with a formula to avoid computing each layer manually. Let's consider the recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined by this relation. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, we can find another condition by looking at the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. But since the particular solution is a constant, let's assume B is the particular solution. Then, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + B) => C*3^n + B = 1 + C*3^n + 3B => Subtract C*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 =4. The outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. But using the recurrence relation approach worked well. So, to summarize, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms the step-by-step computation. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Final Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the outermost layer by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems solid. Alternatively, another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. I've checked each step, computed manually, and then also derived a formula to compute the nth term, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed using the formula 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula confirms the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting after the first 3, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have 1+3(...), so how many times does this happen? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers by the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses: each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, that would mean there are 8 layers, not 9 as I initially thought. Wait, so maybe I overcounted.\n\nWait, let me recount. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) starting from the innermost:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression. Let me see:\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 8 instances of \"1+3(\" because each opening parenthesis after that is part of a new layer. So, that would mean that there are 8 layers after the initial 3. So, in total, the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3), then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1), up to Layer 8: 1+3(Layer7). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer8). So, perhaps I miscounted earlier, thinking there were 9 layers, but actually, it's 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me clarify this. Let's write down the structure:\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3 * Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3 * Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 8: (1 + 3 * Layer7)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer8.\n\nSo, in that case, I should compute up to Layer8, not Layer9.\n\nSo, my earlier computation went up to Layer9, which would be incorrect because there are only 8 layers after the initial 3.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 * Layer8, which is 3 * 9841.\n\nCompute that: 3 * 9841.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number: 9,8,4,1.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9 * 3 =27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841 *3=29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572, but that was when I thought there were 9 layers. So, if there are only 8 layers, then Layer8 is 9841, and 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLet me write the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, in the expression, after the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n- The first one is (1+3(...\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLet me count each opening parenthesis after the first 3:\n\nEach time we have a \"(\", it's part of a new layer.\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, we have 8 opening parentheses: because the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first layer is (1+3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 8 times.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost is (1+3), which doesn't have another \"1+3(\" inside it. So, perhaps the number of layers is 8.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see that the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can go from the innermost to the outermost, which is 8 layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the closing parentheses: starting from the end, each ) corresponds to a layer.\n\nSo, starting from the end:\n\n- The last ) is the innermost Layer1: (1+3)\n\nThen, each subsequent ) closes a layer.\n\nSo, how many closing parentheses are there after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\nAfter 3(, the expression is:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of closing parentheses is 8, because each layer adds a ). So, there are 8 closing parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, there are 8 layers after the initial 3, meaning the expression is 3*(Layer8).\n\nSo, in my earlier computation, I mistakenly went up to Layer9, but it should be Layer8.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572, but that was when I thought there were 9 layers.\n\nSo, now I'm confused because depending on how I count the layers, I get different results.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression with each layer explicitly.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, etc., up to E8.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 9 layers, I got 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from how we count the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, we have 8 instances of \"1+3(\" because each \"(\" after that is a new layer.\n\nSo, that would mean 8 layers after the initial 3, making the total layers 8, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer8).\n\nTherefore, Layer8 is 9841, and 3*9841=29523.\n\nThus, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\nSo, that's 3 layers after the initial 3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nInnermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=13\n\nNext layer: 1+3*13=40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, if I count the layers as 3, then Layer3=40, and 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, if I thought there were 4 layers, I would compute Layer4=1+3*40=121, then 3*121=363, which is incorrect because the expression only has 3 layers after the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the number of layers after the initial 3 is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances, which is 8.\n\nHence, the correct answer is 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88572 when I considered 9 layers, which was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 29523.\n\nBut let me double-check by computing the expression step by step, ensuring that I don't miscount the layers.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by miscounting the number of layers, thinking there were 9 instead of 8. So, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nBut wait, let me check this with another approach to be absolutely sure.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the pattern E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4.\n\nSo, for n=1 to 8, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nWe can compute E8 as follows:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for E_n, but since n is small (8), computing step by step is manageable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with eight layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 8 by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523.\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

Maybe I should compute it step by step without breaking it down. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, like a geometric series or something similar, which could simplify the computation instead of calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for layer 9. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result as before. So, using the formula, I can see that each layer follows a geometric progression, which allows me to compute the value without manually calculating each layer. That's pretty cool! It's interesting how recognizing the pattern can simplify the computation. So, to recap, each layer a_n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a repeating pattern and applying a formula for a geometric series. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The general solution for \\( a_n \\) is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in the layer computation. Let me go back and check each layer step by step because it's easy to make an arithmetic error there.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 9 would be the outermost one. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let me just verify the multiplication once more because sometimes when you're dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.

It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down one by one helped prevent mistakes. I also made sure to verify each multiplication step, especially the final one, because it's easy to miscount when dealing with large numbers. So, overall, I think the process was thorough and the answer is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me recount the layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since I computed each layer step by step and got the same answer, I can be confident that this is correct. I think I've solved it correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Next: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Next: 9 * 3 = 27. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, equating both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: a_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. So, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2, so C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and the closed-form formula gives the same result as the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the next nested term.

So, 90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.

Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That looks like a geometric sequence or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 =13. L_3 =1 +3*L_2=1+39=40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. Now, solving this recurrence might give me a closed-form expression, which could be useful if I have to compute many layers. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is linear and can be written as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} =1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P -3P=1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. When n=1, L_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, Layer9= L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, that's the same result.

Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches (iterative and recursive with a formula) both lead to the same result. So I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, I should only have 5 digits, but I think I'm miscounting the digits. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 29524 is actually a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems right. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\nCalculate 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes, when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step, which affects all subsequent layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's defined as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for Layer n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is Layer n = a * Layer (n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = a^(n) * (Layer 0) + (b * (a^(n) - 1)) / (a - 1)\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So maybe Layer 0 would be 1? Let's see.\n\nIf n=1, Layer 1 = 1 + 3*Layer 0. If Layer 0 = 1, then Layer 1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches.\n\nSo, using the formula:\n\nLayer n = 3^n * Layer 0 + (1*(3^n - 1))/(3 - 1)\n\nSince Layer 0 = 1, this becomes:\n\nLayer n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLayer n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can see that Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, which is a much faster way to compute without having to go through each layer step by step. That's pretty cool! It saves a lot of time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer manually, and both methods give the same result, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling layers. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.

Then, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be growing quite rapidly. Let me check a couple more layers to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nYes, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nEach step seems correct. So, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recursive computation. Each layer is defined based on the previous one.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might be faster than computing each layer step by step. But since there are only nine layers, computing each one isn't too bad.\n\nBut just for fun, let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, and we've modeled it as a recurrence, the closed-form solution confirms the step-by-step computation.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we find the value of each layer step by step. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result. The final computation gives the answer as 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, when you have nested expressions like this, there's a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see if that's possible here. Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, what's the initial condition? When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially with the exponentiation. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I've got this. The key was recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation to find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. But since I double-checked each step and even derived a formula to confirm, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing each layer again step by step, maybe using a different approach or checking for any miscalculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, rather than computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3*C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing L_4 using the formula:\n\nL_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 =729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we derived.\n\nSo, in this case, n=9, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Hmm, that seems right. But wait a minute, let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time it's 1+3(...), so how many times does that happen? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, right? Because each time we go out, it's another layer. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then each step out adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have 1+3(1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we nest 1+3. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers is that? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each 1+3( is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? Because each time we have a new 1+3(, which adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and moving outwards. So, my initial calculation was correct: 9 layers, each computed step by step. So, the final result after computing all layers is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, multiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But I think that's correct because each layer was correctly computed. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) up to 9 layers. Wait, but in this case, it's not infinite; it's finite with 9 layers. So, maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9.\n\nSo, in general, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is E_n^h = A*(3)^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution E_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for n layers, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm that I applied the formula correctly. The formula gives E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n layers. But in our case, the expression is 3*(E_9), so the total expression is 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I get the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, as I did initially, but recognizing the recurrence relation makes it much faster, especially for a large number of layers.\n\nIn summary, the problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By either computing each layer step by step or recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let E_n be the value of the expression with n layers. The relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The solution to the recurrence is E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large, and I might have missed a step. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this more efficiently instead of calculating each layer manually. Let me think about whether this expression follows a geometric series or something similar. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 =1 +3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 is a homogeneous and particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} =0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}-3=177147 -3=177144. Then, (177144)/2=88572. So, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here because I started with a_1=4, which is n=1, but the expression has 9 layers. So, if a_1 is the innermost layer, then a_9 would be the outermost one. So, in the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer from the inside, so a_9 is the outermost, which is correct. Therefore, the formula gives us the correct value, and the manual computation also gives the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think that's it. So, the problem is solved, and the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let me compute a few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a first-order linear recurrence, and the general solution can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + C = 3*(a_{n-1} + C). Wait, maybe a better approach is to find the closed-form expression. The recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144. 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so a = 3, b = 1. Let's check that. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, no, that's for when the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found. Let me try that approach. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to look at it. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). Solving this recurrence, we derive a formula for each layer and compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Next: 9 * 3 = 27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, maybe I should just compute it step by step. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it.

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, no. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then, each time we move out, we add another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet's count the number of 1 + 3(...) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nEach time we move out, we add another layer. Let me see how many times this happens. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3(, there's a 1 + 3(, so let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. But when I computed earlier, I only went up to Layer 9, which was 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that I correctly accounted for all layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- And so on, until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, the total number of layers inside the initial 3 is 9. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct. So, the final result after computing Layer 9 is 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recount each layer's computation step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation of Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, confirming that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nBut in any case, whether computing step by step or using the recurrence relation, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the right approach. Each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from the innermost.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive formula.
