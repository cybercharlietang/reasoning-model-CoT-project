So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have messed up the carry-over somewhere. Let me try another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top: 8, 8, 7, 5, 8, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me write it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Millions place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n- Ten-millions place: 2 * 3 = 6. Wait, but there's no more digits beyond that. Wait, maybe I misaligned the digits. Let me count the digits in 29524. 2 9 5 2 4: that's five digits. So when I multiply by 3, I should have:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7. Write 7.\n- 5 *3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So 29524 *3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.

Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember a similar problem where the result was different. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost: Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, 9 layers. Therefore, my computation was correct, 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times 1+3 appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me parse it: Starting from the outermost, it's 3*(...), then inside that is 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me count them: 1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 2. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 3. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 7. 1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) 8. 1+3(1+3))))))))) 9. 1+3))))))))) So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my initial computation was correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my multiplication again because sometimes when I do it step by step, I might make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me check Layer 8 again. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). But in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3, so starting from 4, then each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that's the only condition, but since the recurrence is first-order, we can find A and B. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the closed-form solution would be a geometric series. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a_1. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can expand this recursively:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_{n-3}\nContinuing this way, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_1\n\nWait, actually, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1). In this case, c=3 and d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^8. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2.\n\nCompute (9/2)*6561: 9 * 6561 = 59049. Then divide by 2: 59049/2 = 29524.5.\n\nThen subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors when computing 3*29524. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers or make an arithmetic mistake. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another set. So, let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my earlier computation is correct. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88572. I think that's the answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Hmm, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this recursive approach also leads to the same result. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see: The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let's substitute the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. I think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward. Wait, but perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. The expression inside each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, and then multiply by 3, I get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify a few of the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Yes, that all looks correct. And 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. It seems correct. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a geometric series, but let me see if I can find a formula for it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4. The outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since I already solved it step by step and confirmed with the formula, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the recurrence relation. 2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth term using the recurrence relation. 4. Compute the outermost term and multiply by 3. 5. Verify the result using both step-by-step computation and the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step by step and then applying the formula confirms the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n8 * 3 = 24, write down 4, carry over 2.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nThen, add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each time, it's one more layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1+3.\n\nThen each time, it's 1+3*(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc.\n\nLooking at the original problem, the innermost part is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside is 1+3(...). Each time, we have another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each layer adds another.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the original expression is 3 followed by 1+3(...), and each time, another 1+3(...). Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times we see 1+3(...):\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and each time, another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. The first one is (1+3(...))\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until we reach the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer wraps around it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...) starting from the innermost.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each time, it's 1+3*(...), so the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, let me count:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9 because after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers, ending with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's 1+3.\n\nThen, moving out, each time, it's 1+3*(...). So, how many times do we have 1+3*(...)? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3 (Layer 1)\n- Then, moving out, it's 1+3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n- Then, 1+3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n- And so on, until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me try to parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, that's too many. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and each time, another (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n- The first (1+3(...)) is the innermost, which is (1+3)\n- Then, each time, we have another (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, each layer is one more (1+3(...)), so there are 9 layers. Therefore, Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9, which is 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, my earlier computation of 9 layers leading to Layer9=29524 and then 3*29524=88572 seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation of Layer9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 88572 seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step, carefully:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me try computing the entire expression step by step again, without assigning layers, but rather by expanding from the inside out.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1+3*(4) = 1+12=13.\n\nNext layer: 1+3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nNext: 1+3*(40)=1+120=121.\n\nNext: 1+3*(121)=1+363=364.\n\nNext: 1+3*(364)=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext: 1+3*(1093)=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext: 1+3*(3280)=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext: 1+3*(9841)=1+29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, maybe I can use that instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation isn't too bad. But for future reference, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 (since the innermost layer is 1+3=4) can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I had to compute this without recognizing the recurrence, I would have just gone step by step as I did initially, computing each layer one by one. It's a bit tedious, but manageable since there are only nine layers. Let me just recap the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Yep, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me verify each step because sometimes when I compute layer by layer, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 at the end: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the multiplication again because sometimes carrying over can cause errors.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, after computing the innermost expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiply by 3. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous), perhaps there's a geometric series or a recursive formula that can be applied. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since there are only 9 layers, maybe computing each step is faster, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n-1} + r^{n-2} + ... + r + 1) + a_1*(r^{n-1}). Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating it, but let me try to find a pattern.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which is correct. So, yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works.\n\nSo, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 =4, and the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the closed-form formula. The general solution for a recurrence relation a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is indeed a_n = (c/(r-1))*(r^{n} -1) + initial term adjustment. Wait, in our case, c=1, r=3, and the initial term a_1=4. So, using the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which seems correct because when n=1, it's (9 -1)/2=4, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified each part, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer and applying the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer by substituting the value of the previous layer.\n\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Closed-Form Formula:**\n   Recognizing the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For Layer 9 (n=9):\n   a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), which is Layer 9, so that's correct. But let me think again. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the pattern is that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, we have 1 + 3*(...), and each of those is a new layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1 + 3(...) adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each 1+3 adds another layer. Let's count the number of 1+3 inside each other. From the innermost: 1+3 is the first. Then, each time, it's 1+3*(previous). So, how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3: 1\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3*(1+3): 2\n- Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)): 3\n- And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3... after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then:\n\n- 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1+3 followed by another (1+3...). Let's count the number of times 1+3 occurs inside each other. From the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n- The first (1+3 is Layer 1\n- The next (1+3 is Layer 2\n- Continuing until Layer 9.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. So, my earlier calculation where I went up to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I computed Layer 9, I correctly accounted for all layers. Let me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something else. Let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers there are. Let me try to write down each layer with their corresponding parentheses.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I compute each layer, I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me double-check each step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it all together from right to left: 2, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nNow, there are no more digits, so we write down the remaining carry if any. But in this case, we're done.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me try to compute a few layers again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, all correct. So, the final computation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each adding a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, yes, layer 9 is the outermost, which is 1 + 3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the problem is to compute 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's plug in a_n = A*3^n + B: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3. However, in this case, it's a finite number of layers, so it's more of a finite geometric series. But since it's nested, the closed-form approach using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward. Either way, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I can conclude that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the closed-form expression for the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula, we compute the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let a_n be the value of the nth layer. The recurrence is:\n   - a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution:**\n   Solving the recurrence relation, we get:\n   - a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\n4. **Compute a_9:**\n   Substitute n = 9 into the formula:\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3*a_9:\n   - 3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me try again, perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (from 2\u00d73 +2), then 8 (from 9\u00d73 +1), then 5 (from 5\u00d73), then 7 (from 2\u00d73 +1), then 2 (from 4\u00d73). So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method: 29524 \u00d73. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) \u00d73 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 +500\u00d73 +20\u00d73 +4\u00d73 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12 = Now, adding these together:\n\n60000 +27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Each step seems to follow logically, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term and working through each layer, we find the value at each step and use it to compute the next. After reaching the outermost layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Use the result from Layer 1.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Use the result from Layer 2.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Use the result from Layer 3.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Use the result from Layer 4.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Use the result from Layer 5.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Use the result from Layer 6.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Use the result from Layer 7.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Use the result from Layer 8.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result from Layer 9 by 3.\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, maybe it's better to do it step by step. Let's write it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28.

Write down 27.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 has digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands place: 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow add them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Each time, I compute 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can compute it in another way or check with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nThis kind of expression is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that, let's try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572. That confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, it's like a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nBut I think the method I used, computing each layer step by step, is sufficient and accurate. Plus, verifying it with the recurrence relation method gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. But wait, the original expression is 3*(...), so I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about it. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each term step by step is feasible. Alternatively, for a deeper understanding, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. So, this formula works. Now, since our problem has 9 layers, that corresponds to a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms my earlier computation. It's reassuring to see that both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can verify by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer by substituting the previous result, and then multiplied the outermost result by 3. Each step involved multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer n is 1 + 3*layer(n-1). I did this for nine layers, then multiplied by 3 at the end. Wait, actually, in my initial breakdown, I considered Layer 1 as the innermost, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 was 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9, which was 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which gave me 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a formula for it, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, matches Layer 3. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which is the final answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value can be computed step by step. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is 29,524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for Layer n. Let's denote Layer n as L_n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L_9 directly. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. First, compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, 59049 -1=59048. Multiply by 3: 59048*3=177144. Then, divide by 2: 177144/2=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct because both methods gave me the same result, and I've verified the formula for each layer. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers (from layer 1 to layer 9), let's compute a_9. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 only has five digits. Let me count: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying, I only have five digits to process. So let me correct that.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 =15. Write down5, carry1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3=27 +1=28. Write down8, carry2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8. Write down8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 \u00d73=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So is that the final answer? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 +3\u00d74=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3\u00d713=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7Layer9, which is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first '(', each subsequent '(' adds a layer. Let me count the number of '(' after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another ( after the first 3(...\n3. Continuing, I think there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So starting from the innermost, which is Layer1: 1+3, then Layer2:1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9:1+3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, 9 layers, and then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, and then 3\u00d729524=88572. That seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that looks correct. So 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C -3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2=3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of (1 + 3(...)). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, reading the numbers from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 24 = 59048. Now add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in computation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute the expression again, but perhaps using a different approach, maybe recognizing a pattern or formula. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. We can see that each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do it step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me verify Layer 9 again. Layer 8 was 9841, right? So Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, 9841*3: 3, 12 (carry over 1), 24 +1=25, 27 +2=29. So, 9841*3=29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard solution method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the result.

Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Specifically, for a recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found as a_n = (1 + 3^n)/(1 - 3), but wait, actually, let me recall the standard method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our case, we have 9 layers, but let me check: Wait, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which according to the formula would be (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, indeed, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same answer as before. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find a general formula for each layer and compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent the nth layer. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and maybe it's a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got before.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and finding a closed-form formula\u2014I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} - 1)/2, which is exactly what the closed-form solution represents.\n\nJust to double-check, let's compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 correct.\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 correct.\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous result). Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write down the first few terms: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, the recurrence can be solved as follows: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute 3^{10}, which is 59049, then (3^{10} -1)/2 is 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. So, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations. Each layer was computed correctly, and the closed-form solution confirms the result.

So when I multiply by 3, I should only have 5 digits times 3, which would be a maximum of 6 digits. Let me do it again carefully:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's 5 digits times 3, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of layers (only 9), computing each step is manageable. However, for more layers, a formula would be better. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found as follows: The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer and applying the formula for the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think I did it right. Each layer is built by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on, until Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be expressed as a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1).\n\nWait, let me check that formula. The standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*k^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = k*a_p + c \u2192 a_p - k*a_p = c \u2192 a_p*(1 - k) = c \u2192 a_p = c/(1 - k). So the general solution is a_n = A*k^n + c/(1 - k). Using the initial condition to find A. Let's apply this to our case where a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1? Wait, no, in our case, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, using the standard approach, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we assume a constant solution a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 \u2192 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p = 1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation formula, I can compute the result without having to go through each layer manually, which would be especially useful if there were more layers. But for nine layers, step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, both methods agree.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the expression has nine layers, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer's result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and moving out, there are 9 layers, ending with Layer 9. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire original expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\nThe next digit is the ten-thousands place, which is 9, but wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying, we go digit by digit:\n\n- Units: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- Hundreds: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- Thousands: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each layer checks out. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) eight more times. So, actually, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3, so n=9.\n\nWait, actually, let's clarify: the innermost layer is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). The outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers inside the outermost 3 is 9. Therefore, n=9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation formula, we arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a geometric series in disguise.\n\nBut in any case, computing step by step or using the formula both lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check my multiplication: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes, when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscompute a step. Let me recount the layers as per the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is layer 1. Then, each time you go out, you add another layer. So, let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then, moving out, each (1+3(...)) adds a layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of (1+3... Let's see: 3(1+3(...)) So, the first (1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3 is another layer. Let me count the number of (1+3 in the expression. Starting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first (1+3 is at position 2, then each subsequent (1+3 is another layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. 3(1+3(...) 3. 3(1+3(...) 4. 3(1+3(...) 5. 3(1+3(...) 6. 3(1+3(...) 7. 3(1+3(...) 8. 3(1+3(...) 9. 3(1+3(...)) So, there are 9 layers, each with a (1+3(...)). Therefore, I have correctly computed up to layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say we have a smaller version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute this step by step. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, if I compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for this smaller case. Therefore, applying the same method to the larger problem should give me the correct answer, which is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe a better way is to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, let's write it as 29,524. Multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, that seems right. Let me check: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something like that. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the general formula might be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, not matching. Maybe another approach. Let me consider solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. So, that's another way to get the answer directly using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I computed each layer step by step, ensuring that each layer was correctly calculated based on the previous one. Then, after computing the innermost 9 layers, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Additionally, I derived a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, which confirmed that the 9th layer is 29,524, leading to the final answer of 88,572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. The final result is computed as follows:\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the outermost multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
