    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did 29524 * 3, I think I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one step which propagates outward. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then final step: 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So each term an = 1 + 3*an-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is an = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form expression for an. The recurrence is an = 3*an-1 + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving an = 3*an-1, which has the solution A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is an = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. When n=1, a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, an = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, an = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me confirm: Starting from the innermost as a1, then a2, up to a9. So the outermost expression is a9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a9. So, 3*a9 = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, (177144)/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, using the geometric series approach, I also get 88572. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as repeatedly applying the operation of multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 1. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 1, after one layer, it's 4; after two layers, 13; after three layers, 40, and so on. After nine layers, it's 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, yes, I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me try computing a few more layers manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Wait, I already did that, but let me check Layer 4 again: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all adds up. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. So putting it all together: 27 (from the first digit) and then 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right. Let me write it out properly:\n\n    29524\n  x   3\n  -------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 8 (from the 2*3 + 2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that seems off because the digits should be in the same order. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, when multiplying, you start from the units place and move left, so the digits of the product should be written accordingly. Let me write it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. So, units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit is 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together, the product is 88572. Wait, that seems correct because:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would allow me to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since we only have nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But it's good to recognize the pattern.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, which gives (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is efficient.\n\nBut since I was computing each layer step by step, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result.\n\nI think I've got this. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we find each layer's value and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on. It looks like each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Great, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute the result without manually calculating each layer. That would have saved time, especially if the expression had more layers. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, to recap, the problem required computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By either iteratively computing each layer or recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. The final computation after the ninth layer is multiplying by 3, leading us to the answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Finally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together, reading from the last step to the first: 7, then 3, then 7, 8, 5, 7, 2, 8, 6? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it out properly:\n\n   29524\nx     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry over 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry over 1.\n4 * 3 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 has 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0\n\nWait, that seems different from my previous calculation. Let me check:\n\n29524\nx   3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carryover 0\n5 * 3 =15 \u21925, carryover1\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover0\n\nSo writing it down: 88572. Wait, that's 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048 +29524:\n\nAdding 59048 +29524:\n\n59048 +20000=79048\n\n79048 +9000=88048\n\n88048 +524=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check that because that might be where I went wrong. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*(40)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*(121)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer:1 +3*(4)=13\n\nNext:1 +3*(13)=40\n\nNext:1 +3*(40)=121\n\nNext:1 +3*(121)=364\n\nNext:1 +3*(364)=1093\n\nNext:1 +3*(1093)=3280\n\nNext:1 +3*(3280)=9841\n\nNext:1 +3*(9841)=29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:3*(29524)=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. So the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute each step again without writing down the layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1+3=4\n\nThen, moving out one layer:1+3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nNext:1+3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nNext:1+3*(40)=1+120=121\n\nNext:1+3*(121)=1+363=364\n\nNext:1+3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1+3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1+3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\nNext:1+3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.

Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me some time. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait a minute, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, I think these are related to the terms of the form (4^n - 1)/3. Let me check: For n=1: (4^1 - 1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 3/3 =1. No, that doesn't match L_1=4. Wait, maybe it's (4^n - 1)/3 + something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me see: L_1 =4, L_2=13=4*3 +1, L_3=13*3 +1=40, which is 13*3=39 +1=40. Similarly, L_4=40*3 +1=121, and so on. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. Given L_1 =4, and L_n =3*L_{n-1} +1. Let's find the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Homogeneous equation: L_n^(h) =3*L_{n-1}^(h). Characteristic equation: r=3, so L_n^(h)=A*3^n. Particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume L_n^(p)=C. Substituting into the recurrence: C=3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, general solution: L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now apply initial condition L_1=4: 4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula saves time, especially if the number of layers is larger. But since I had only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, though it did take some time and careful calculation to avoid mistakes. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So yes, it's 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should double-check each layer step by step. Let's go through them again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct.

Then, 3*29524=88572. Okay, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4 L_2 =1 +3*L_1=1 +12=13 L_3=1 +3*L_2=1 +39=40 L_4=1 +3*L_3=1 +120=121 L_5=1 +3*L_4=1 +363=364 L_6=1 +3*L_5=1 +1092=1093 L_7=1 +3*L_6=1 +3279=3280 L_8=1 +3*L_7=1 +9840=9841 L_9=1 +3*L_8=1 +29523=29524 So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, let's consider the next term. For n=2, L_2=13: 13 = A*3^2 + B =>13=9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 -4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) =>9=6A =>A= 9/6= 3/2. Now, substitute A=3/2 into the first equation: 4= 3*(3/2) + B =>4= 9/2 + B =>B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 ). Which is 3*(59049-1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and finding the general formula\u2014give me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which could save time if there were more layers, but since there are only nine, it's not necessary here. However, for practice, let's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet's test this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each layer without having to manually calculate each step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, either method works.\n\nJust to make sure, let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and since there are nine sets of (1+3(...)), that means there are nine layers. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9. So, a_9 is the result inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524.

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: Starting with 3(1+3(...). Each time, there's another 3(1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: The structure is 3( A ), where A is 1 + 3(B), and B is 1 + 3(C), etc. Each time, we have another layer. Let me count how many times 1+3(...) occurs. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, perhaps? Wait, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

So, does that mean there are 9 layers? Or is the innermost part just 1+3, and then each layer adds another 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me write out the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost expression: (1+3) = 4.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo that's 9 layers, each time adding another 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I counted the layers, I had 9 layers, but the original expression seems to have 9 sets of parentheses. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nWait, 3*9841: 9841 \u00d7 3. Let me compute that: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: As I computed before, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000\u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12. Wait, but that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000\u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer's computation because if any of those layers were wrong, the final answer would be off.

But wait, I just noticed that the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean there are nine layers, each computed as above? Let me count the number of layers in the original expression to make sure I didn't miss any. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, from the inside:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, right? Because the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, yes, nine layers, each computed as above. So, my computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have just one layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Now, with two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. With three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, but according to my earlier computation, Layer 3 was 40, and 3*40 = 120. So, the pattern seems to be that each additional layer increases the result significantly. Let me check with three layers:\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. Correct. So, if I follow this, each layer adds a multiplication by 3 and adds 1. It seems like a geometric progression, but perhaps it's better to see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form seems to be: Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_n where n=9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

So putting it together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is actually 88572. Let me check that again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, right? So 3 * 29524 is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. Let me try computing Layer 9 again: Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 8*3=24 +2=26, write 6, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did that correctly.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in the layers. Let's recompute each layer carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying that by 3: 29524 * 3.

Wait, that gives me 88572. Let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute each layer again to confirm. Let me recompute each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the equation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B. So, setting them equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, used a recurrence relation, solved it, and confirmed the result using an alternative method. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, it seems like each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed before. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a linear recurrence, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: The first term is 3, then 3*4, then 3*13, etc. But perhaps that's complicating things. Another approach: Let me consider that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then, after 9 layers, we have a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute the value step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to a closed-form solution. Applying this, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the general term of the sequence, we determine that the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Let's add them: 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. 9 + nothing=9. So 59048 +29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer follows a certain formula, so maybe I can find a general formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, that's (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check that for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. So for Layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer1, and the outermost is Layer9. So Layer9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So Layer9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So that confirms the answer again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I expand the entire expression, it might form a sum where each term is 3^k for some k. Let me try to see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So E=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to see how many 3s are multiplied. Wait, each time, we have a 3 multiplying a term that's 1 plus another 3 times something. So, if I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to write it out step by step. Let's say after expanding a few layers: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))).\nWait, perhaps I can write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))), with 9 layers. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern where E satisfies a certain equation. Let me see: If I let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but the inner part is similar to E itself, but scaled. Wait, actually, no, because each time, the expression inside is one layer less. So, perhaps I can find a relation where E is built from a smaller version of itself. Let me think: Suppose that each time, after the first 3*(1 + 3*...), the inner part is similar but shorter. So, perhaps if I denote F as the expression inside E, then E=3*(1 + F), and F=3*(1 + G), and so on, until the innermost part. But that might not directly help. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, let's see: If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be expanded as 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But that seems recursive. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to compute the expression by expanding it step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out, but perhaps I can see a pattern.\n\nWait, I think the approach I took earlier, computing each layer step by step, is solid and gives me confidence in the answer. So, perhaps I don't need to overcomplicate it with a general formula unless I suspect an error in my step-by-step approach. But since the step-by-step and the general formula both lead to the same result, I think I'm safe.\n\nJust to recap, here's the step-by-step computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.

Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's do it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then the final result is 3*L_9. I can see that each L_n is following a pattern. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, I was able to compute each layer step by step. Then, using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I confirmed the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive approach. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived closed-form formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it with a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by: a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c) But wait, in this case, c = 3, which is greater than 1, so 1 - c is negative, and we have to be careful with the signs. Let me recall the formula for the solution of a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The general solution is: a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c) But let's plug in the values. Here, a_1 = 4, c = 3, d = 1. So, first, compute the particular solution: d/(1 - c) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Then, the homogeneous solution is based on a_1 - particular solution: a_1 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n = 1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (9/2)*3^3 - 1/2 = (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, the general formula for the nth layer is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute 3^8 first. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Let's compute each term: (9/2)*6561 = (9 * 6561)/2. Let's compute 9 * 6561: 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. Adding them up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500, 58500 + 540 = 59040, 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, (9 * 6561)/2 = 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtracting 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents and multiplications, let me cross-verify a couple of steps. For instance, 3^8 is 6561, which is correct because 3^4 is 81, so 3^8 is 81^2, which is 6561. Then, 9 * 6561: 6561 * 10 is 65610, subtract 6561 gives 65610 - 6561 = 59049, which is correct. Divided by 2 is 29524.5, subtract 0.5 gives 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So, all steps check out. Therefore, I'm certain that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but let me verify my earlier computations because that seems like a big number, and sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer and ensure I didn't make an error in calculation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster or reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to ensure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of error. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a closed-form formula. Each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, leading to the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3 + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 13. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see if that's possible. The recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, let's write the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the nonhomogeneous term is 1. Let me write the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume that the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to ensure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final step is to multiply this by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Solving the recurrence gives \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer \\( n=9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but when I was computing the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check my layer computations because that seems like a lot of layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...), so each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, that's 1 layer, then each additional (1+3(...)) adds another layer. So, let me count the number of times I have 1+3(...). Let me write it down:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, the next layer is:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nThen,\n\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nContinuing this way, each time adding another layer. So, how many layers are there in total? The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds a new set. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, that's 1 layer, then each additional layer adds one more. So, the total number of layers is 9, because each time you go out, you add another layer, starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), up to 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But I'm wondering if that's correct because the numbers get big quickly. Let me verify each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because when I computed 3*9841, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 3*9841 again. 9841 \u00d7 3: 1\u00d73=3, 4\u00d73=12, 8\u00d73=24, 9\u00d73=27. So, writing it out:\n\n9841\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 2\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write down 9, carry over 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write down the 2. Wait, no, 9841 is a four-digit number, so:\n\nWait, 9841 is 9 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 4 (tens), 1 (units). So:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3 (units)\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carry 2\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write 9, carry 2\n\nNow, since we're done with all digits, we write the carried 2 before the thousands place. So, the result is 29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K = 1 + 3K \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3 \u00d7 29524 as (30000 \u00d7 3) - (476 \u00d7 3).\n\nWait, 29524 = 30000 - 476.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 3 \u00d7 (30000 - 476) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That's another way to confirm it.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Recognize the Recurrence Relation**: Each layer follows the recurrence \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). This can be solved to find a closed-form formula: \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Final Layer**: For the 9th layer, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

Hmm, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each operation. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nExpression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's start from the innermost part:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 4 * 3 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as 2 9 5 2 4. So, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). Now, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, starting from the units: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is layer 1. Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3. So, that means there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, that should be correct. But let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8)). So, I think my approach is correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and then the final result is 3 times Layer 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. As we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again without the formula.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Because if any layer is wrong, the subsequent ones will be off too.
