    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nNow, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = let me compute that. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me calculate that. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 3*9841 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, this becomes 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Let me compute each part:\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Okay, that matches my previous calculation. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with so many layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88,572. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for C and D. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + D = 3C + D.\n\nAlso, the homogeneous solution is when the nonhomogeneous term is zero, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1, a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_n as defined. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, since the outermost layer is a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. So that's another way to compute it directly.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it right. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we derive a general formula for the nth layer. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and multiply it by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{...})\\). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses: After the first 3, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses: each ( starts a new layer. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this recurrence relation as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can also compute the expression by expanding each layer step by step without using the formula, just to be thorough. Let me try that again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. I think I've verified it enough times. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 + 1 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 364*3: Let's compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. Each step checks out, and the final result is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me check if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. So far, each layer is just 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me keep going to see if I can spot a pattern. Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.

Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Let's add them: 59048 + 29524. Adding units place: 8 + 4 = 12, carry over 1. Tens place: 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. Hundreds place: 0 +5=5. Thousands place: 9 +9=18, carry over 1. Ten-thousands place: 5 +2=7 +1=8. Hundred-thousands place: 0 +0=0. So, total is 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't miss any layers. Starting from the innermost, I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. That seems right.

Let me verify 3*29524 another way to be sure. Let's break down 29524: 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 becomes 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, interesting, the numbers are getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. So, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, that's a jump. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 24*3 = 72. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in adding or multiplying somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about it. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on, up to L_9, and the final result is 3*L_9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the innermost is L_1, and the outermost is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without going through each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is larger. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Using this formula, we determine the value of the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). This creates a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let L_n represent the value of the nth layer from the innermost. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the innermost layer L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Find the Closed-form Formula**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For n=9 (the outermost layer):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times L_9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that calculation again because 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 is 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n is the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If a_{n-1} = C*3^{n-1} + D, then a_n = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Comparing this to the general solution a_n = C*3^n + D, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), leading to a closed-form solution. The final value is calculated as follows:\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n2. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n3. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the outermost expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{(ninth layer)}\\).\n\nFinal result:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 * 3. Let's break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me verify the multiplication for Layer 9 again: 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Then, 29524 *3. Let's compute 29524*3 another way. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can compute each term step by step. Let me see if that's the case. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me try to solve it. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Hmm, that seems a bit odd, but let's proceed. The general solution is a_n = a_p + a_n^h = -1/2 + C*3^n. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = -1/2 + C*3^1 => 4 = -1/2 + 3C => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n = -1/2 + (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, the final step is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is building up a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But in this case, because each term is built upon the previous one, it's a bit different, but the recurrence approach worked well. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer's value can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step:\n29,524 * 3\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\nThen, 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext, 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check the addition when I was computing Layer 9. So, Layer 8 was 9841, so 3 times that is 29,523, right? Because 9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000, 800 \u00d7 3 = 2,400, 40 \u00d7 3 = 120, and 1 \u00d7 3 = 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29,524 \u00d7 3 again. Maybe I should compute it another way to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute each layer again quickly to see if I made any errors in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that all checks out. Each layer seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can compute it using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify the calculation.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recurrence.\n\nLet's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and non-homogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's the same as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nThis confirms the result again. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another approach, perhaps by expanding the entire expression, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series.\n\nLooking back, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\nThe closed-form we derived earlier is correct, so I think it's safe to say that the final result is 88,572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, as both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave the same result.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving outward to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me continue. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct.

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.

Let me just check one of the middle layers again to be sure. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yes, that's correct. Another one: Layer 7: 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, total 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. So, I think all the layers are correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,000 *3 = 87,000; 524*3=1,572. So, 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, 88,572 is the final result. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Layer n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me recompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Hmm, same result. So, unless I made a mistake in the very first step, which I don't think I did, the answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check the structure of the problem again. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, from the innermost 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many times I computed layers: Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*(Layer 9)=88572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so that is indeed 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I think my calculation is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this result without computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It seems like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, for example:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help me compute a_9 more efficiently. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier to ensure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's compute 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, and 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me see: Starting from Layer 1: 4. Then Layer 2: 13, which is 3*4 + 1. Layer 3: 40, which is 3*13 + 1. Layer 4: 121, which is 3*40 + 1. Hmm, that seems to be the case. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3n + 1, where n is the previous layer's value. So, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let me think about that. If each term is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute the entire expression without computing each layer, I could note that the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident in the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is calculated. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the value of the entire expression is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So the final result is 88572.

Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait a second, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first layer is the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So from the inside out, how many layers? Let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Next is (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3) = 4, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So layers 1 through 9, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So my previous computation seems correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. So, unless I made an arithmetic mistake in the calculations, that should be the correct answer. Let me check each step again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from a_1=4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1 up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the innermost parentheses is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1.

Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. It's a pretty big number, but considering how many layers there are, it makes sense that the value grows exponentially. Each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series but nested, so the growth is quite rapid. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of expression without having to compute each layer step by step. Maybe something involving powers of 3? Let me think. If I look at the layers, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series. Let's see: Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L(n). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me plug in the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1. So, B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L(1) = 4: L(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the final result**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. Because the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, I need to multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. But a_n is also equal to C*3^n + D. So, setting them equal: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtracting 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121.

Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12.

So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279.\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840.\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\nLet me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a bit large, but I can break it down:\n3*9000=27000\n3*800=2400\n3*40=120\n3*1=3\nAdding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\nBreaking it down:\n3*20000=60000\n3*9000=27000\n3*500=1500\n3*20=60\n3*4=12\nAdding those together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a large number, but considering how many layers there are, it might be correct.\n\nLet me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or find a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, Layer 2 is a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich is exactly what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the formula is correctly applied. Since the layers go from 1 to 9, and the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom: 7,7,7,5,7,2,2,1.\n\nWait, that might be confusing. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2\n3*3=9 +2=11, write 1, carryover 1\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, let's write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 \\) is the innermost layer and \\( a_9 \\) is the outermost layer.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute 3*9841 correctly. 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Now, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the innermost Layer 1 was 4, and each subsequent layer built up to Layer 9 being 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the multiplication steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a common pattern in problems like this. It's similar to computing a geometric series or something that might have a formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, if there were more layers, we might look for a pattern or formula to generalize the computation. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, the step-by-step approach works fine. Just to be absolutely sure, let me verify the multiplication at each layer again, especially the larger ones where it's easy to make a mistake. Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093, correct.

Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Let's compute that: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Okay, that's getting larger quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, this is growing exponentially.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: Well, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, the value is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me see if I can model this with a formula. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. This recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions and C is a particular solution. Let\u2019s find the particular solution. Assuming the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost layer, which is a_1, is 4, and each subsequent layer a_n can be found using the formula. Since the original problem has nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from the innermost term. But in this case, since each term is added after multiplication, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well. Another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is similar to a geometric series with a ratio of 3. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, the inner part is similar to S/3, because S = 3*(inner expression). Let me try to express it that way. Let\u2019s denote the inner expression as E, so S = 3*E. Then, E = 1 + 3*(another inner expression). But that another inner expression is similar to E as well. Wait, but in this case, each E is one layer deeper. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't as straightforward because each layer is only one step deeper, not infinitely recursive. Since there are nine layers, it's a finite recursion, so maybe the step-by-step approach is better. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier is more efficient. So, since I have the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, S = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nGot that. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nHmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the next layer. Let's see if I can spot a pattern here or maybe find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. But maybe computing each layer isn't too bad, just time-consuming. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the Layer 9 expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go back and verify each layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe I can approach this problem differently to verify. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * C + d, where d is the particular solution. Let's find d.\n\nAssuming a steady-state solution, where L_n = L_{n-1} = d. So, d = 1 + 3*d.\n\nSolving for d: d = 1 + 3d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = 3^n * C - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = 3^1 * C - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works! So, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nThere's no more digits, so write down 2.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n? Let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me think again about the recurrence relation. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is indeed L_n = a^n * (L_1 - d) + d, where d is the particular solution. As we found earlier, d = -1/2, so L_n = 3^n * (4 + 1/2) - 1/2 = 3^n * (9/2) - 1/2. Wait, no, actually, the general solution is L_n = a^n * C + d, where C is determined by the initial condition. So, plugging in n=1: L_1 = 3^1 * C + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yep, that's correct. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1)...)). If I expand all the layers, how many terms would I get? Each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 3*1 = 3\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*3 = 1 + 9 = 10\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because earlier we had Layer 2 as 13. Wait, maybe this approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try to expand the expression step by step.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3. Since there are nine layers, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around with another 1 + 3*(...). So, when I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a sum where each term is 3^k, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer is itself a sum, maybe the entire expression can be written as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's try to express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression, so E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but that might not help. Alternatively, since we've already computed that E = 3*Layer9, and Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to think about it: the entire expression is (3^{11} -3)/2, which equals 88572.\n\nThat's a good check because using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can see that the expression simplifies to that. So, that gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and then confirming with a geometric series approach, I arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 3*3=9. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recap each layer quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. Wait, perhaps this is a geometric series? Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the result. I think this is the correct answer. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result.

Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572  \n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, so each layer is getting bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times the Layer 9 expression, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify 3*29524 another way to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it down: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,8,8,7,7,8,7,2,8. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I messed up the digit positions. Let me try another approach. Let's write it vertically:\n\n      29524\n    x      3\n    --------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 has only 5 digits, so when I multiply by 3, it should be a 5-digit number times 3, resulting in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me count the digits:\n\n29524 is 5 digits. 3*29524 should be 88572, which is 5 digits as well. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step multiplication, I think I went beyond the number of digits. Let me correct that.\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n      29524\n    x      3\n    --------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we add the carry if any. But in this case, after the last digit, we have no more digits, so we're done.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that's 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've done each step carefully, and the calculations add up. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct.

Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.

Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, and 24*3=72. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make an error. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L1, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but wait, since a \u2260 1. Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let me assume a particular solution L_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, starting from L1 to L9. So the outermost layer is L9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3^{10} -1 = 59048. Then, (59048)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more by computing each layer with the formula to see if it aligns with the step-by-step computation. For example, L9 should be (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I found earlier. So, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me calculate that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4, that's correct. Then, each subsequent layer: 1+3*previous layer. So Layer 2: 1+12=13, Layer 3: 1+39=40, Layer 4: 1+120=121, Layer 5: 1+363=364, Layer 6: 1+1092=1093, Layer 7: 1+3279=3280, Layer 8: 1+9840=9841, Layer 9: 1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplying by 3 each time, but since it's nested, maybe it's a geometric progression. Let me see if that's the case. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write out the recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since the innermost layer is 1+3=4). Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 +39=40, which matches what I did earlier. So, this is indeed a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since this is a finite number of layers (9 layers), computing each step manually is feasible. However, if the number of layers were larger, we might need a formula. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + (a_0 - c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^{n}), provided r \u2260 1. In this case, c=1, r=3, and a_1=4. Wait, actually, in the standard form, the recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, so here, c=1, r=3, and the initial term a_1=4. So, the solution would be a_n = (1)*(3^{n}) + (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3))*(1 - 3^{n}). Let me compute that. First, compute (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) = 4 - (1/(-2)) = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 or 9/2. Then, a_n = 3^{n} + (9/2)*(1 - 3^{n}) = 3^{n} + (9/2) - (9/2)*3^{n} = (1 - 9/2)*3^{n} + 9/2 = (-7/2)*3^{n} + 9/2. Hmm, let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging in n=1: (-7/2)*3 + 9/2 = (-21/2) + 9/2 = (-12)/2 = -6. Wait, that's not matching. I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me try again. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n-1}. Wait, maybe I confused the indices. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (c=1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A = 1.5 or 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2}/2) -1/2= (9/2) -1/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: (3^{3}/2) -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, which matches our earlier calculation. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me see: (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, the value at each layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: n=1, which gives (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. Then, Layer 2: n=2, (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses before the final multiplication by 3, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which we calculated as 88572. Let me confirm that multiplication again: 29524 *3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and applying the formula directly. That's pretty cool because it avoids having to compute each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. I think I've got it. The answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula using the geometric series lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and applying the formula for the sum of a geometric progression, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let me break it down: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9841 is close to 10,000, so 3*10,000 is 30,000, but I need to subtract 3*(159) because 10,000 - 9841 is 159. Wait, actually, 9841 is 10,000 minus 159, so 3*9841 is 3*(10,000 - 159) = 30,000 - 477 = 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29,524. Let me calculate that. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 24*3 is 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 72 is 88,572. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me solve for A and B. Also, let's see the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, then plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives me 88,572, confirming my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, giving (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, so each layer is getting larger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems to add correctly. Let me verify a couple of the multiplications to be safe. For Layer 6: 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192. 900+192=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. 3000+279=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. 27000+2400=29400, 29400+123=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. That looks right. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279.
