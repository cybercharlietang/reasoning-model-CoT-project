    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. Let's do that:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 1: 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carryover 1: 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3. Compute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. 27000+2400=29400, 29400+123=29523. 1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find D first. To find D, we can set the equation equal for all n: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression up to 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we derive a closed-form formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for \\(n = 9\\), we compute the innermost expression as 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 is the same as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.

Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,7,5,2. Wait, that would be 88,752. Hmm, but earlier I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my addition again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial breakdown. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 8 (from the last digit), 7, 8, 5, 2. Wait, that's 87,852? No, wait, let's do it properly. Let me write it out:\n\n   29524\nx     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572. So, my initial calculation was correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 87,852, but that's incorrect because I miscounted the digits. Let me recount: The number is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (from the 2*3 +2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The base case is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, the formula works. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I calculated before. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer step by step. That was a bit more efficient. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series. Let's see. Each layer is built by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., as before. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. The solution we found earlier is the same as the sum of a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified this in multiple ways now: step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and recognizing it as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I guess the key takeaway here is that recognizing the pattern allows us to find a formula, which can save time instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad, although it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake along the way. I should probably double-check my arithmetic one more time to be sure. Let me go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I'm solid here. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula corroborates the result. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, but wait, that's beyond the digits. Wait, maybe I should just do 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88,572. Let me verify with another method: 29,524 * 3. 30,000 *3=90,000, subtract 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29,524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step followed logically, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a jump. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the nesting is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works for all the layers I computed. Therefore, the final value before multiplying by the outermost 3 is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, so each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if that pattern holds. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Let me verify 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000+279=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this another way: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 3*3=9. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88572.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.

Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20,000*3 = 60,000 9,000*3 = 27,000 500*3 = 1,500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or look for a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula I can apply here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the sequence: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Hmm, that seems like each term is following a pattern where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we're dealing with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 3*120=360, and 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9). Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572. I think this makes sense because each layer is just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, which seems to follow a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's finite, we can compute each step manually. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each step is feasible. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40.

Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a new layer.

The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(...), inside is 1 + 3(...), and each time we have another 1 + 3(...).

Let me see: From the initial 3, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time moving outward, we have another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, each time we go outward, we have another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections: 1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) The innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we have another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n   - The first \"1 + 3(\" is layer 1.\n   - Then inside that, another \"1 + 3(\" is layer 2.\n   - Continuing, we have layers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each time we go outward, it's another layer. So, the initial 3(...) is multiplied by layer 9, right? So, the initial expression is 3*(layer 9). So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, when I computed up to layer 9, that was correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure that I didn't make any multiplication errors. Let me recompute layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let's compute 9841*3:\n\n9841\n*    3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did everything correctly. Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost, and each time, I made sure to compute the multiplication before adding 1. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such nested terms.\n\n2. **Compute from Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 Let's compute 3*40: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving to Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 Let me compute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. Let me verify Layer 9 again. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. That seems correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, it's better to do it digit by digit. Let me write it out: 29524\n*        3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, 29524 *3 is indeed 88572. Hmm, so my calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and I went up to Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. Then, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, that's Layer 2. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait a minute, hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression starts with 3*(...), so actually, the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the expression inside the first 3*(...). But when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me see if that's correct. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(...).

Each time we have a closing parenthesis, that's a layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count the number of times I see a closing parenthesis before the last one. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think of it as starting from the innermost and working out.

So, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers.\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1+3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1+3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1+3*(Layer 3) (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1+3*(Layer 4) (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1+3*(Layer 5) (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1+3*(Layer 6) (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1+3*(Layer 7) (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1+3*(Layer 8) (Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3 followed by 8 layers of 1+3*(...). So, perhaps there are 8 layers after the initial 3, making the total layers 9, including the initial 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3*(... occurs.\n\nLet me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Each occurrence is a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI see that after the initial 3, there are 8 occurrences of \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, that's 8 layers after the initial 3. So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, Layer 8 is 9841, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation where I had 29524. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\nSo, after 8 layers, the value is 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 9 layers, which led me to 29524. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me check the expression again. The expression is 3 followed by 8 layers of 1+3*(...). So, the initial 3 is multiplied by the result of 8 layers. Therefore, the total number of layers inside the initial 3 is 8, not 9. So, my corrected calculation is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check again by counting the parentheses.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. So, starting after the initial 3, how many \"(\" are there?\n\n1. ( after 3(\n2. Then another ( after 3(\n3. Another (\n4. Another (\n5. Another (\n6. Another (\n7. Another (\n8. Another (\n9. Another (\n10. Another (\n\nWait, that can't be right because the expression ends with ))))))) after the last 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first \"(\" after 3 is Layer 1: 1+3(...)\n- Then, inside that, another \"(\" for Layer 2: 1+3(...)\n- Continuing until the last \"(\" before the final closing parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 8 \"(\" symbols. Each \"(\" represents a new layer. So, there are 8 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the calculation should be:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, after 8 layers, the value is 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was counting one too many layers, which led me to 29524 instead of 29523. So, the correct answer is 29523.\n\nBut let me double-check by computing each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers once more to be sure. The expression is 3 followed by 8 layers of 1+3*(...), so 8 layers inside. Therefore, the total layers inside the initial 3 are 8, leading to 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLet me think about this. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n... and so on, up to a_8, since there are 8 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 8, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the value inside the initial 3 is 9841, and the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 29523.\n\nBut let me confirm this once more by computing a_8 using the closed-form formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n = 8, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29523.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{29523}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 8, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final value of the entire expression:\n\\[ 3 \\times 9841 = 29523 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{29523}\n\\]"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's Layer 2. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on a second. The original expression starts with 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, we need to multiply it by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Well, 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, a_9 would be the value of the outermost parentheses before multiplying by the initial 3. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, that's a good consistency check. Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be seen as a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula I derived is indeed a geometric series sum formula. So, either way, whether by step-by-step computation or by finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by recognizing a recursive pattern. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and propagate outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the recursive pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13: that's 39. So, 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let's do that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me just verify that I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Let me recheck a few layers.

Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. To make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. For n=2, L_2=13. Using the recurrence, L_2=3*L_1 + 1=3*4 +1=13. Using the general solution: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4; 2) 9A + B =13. Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 => 6A=9 => A=9/6=3/2=1.5. Then, plugging back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B =4 => 9/2 + B =4 => B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Okay, so this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, giving L_1=4. Then, Layer 2 is n=2, giving L_2=13, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is n=9. So, Layer 9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88,572. I think that solidifies the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 121 times 3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 363 + 1 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplications. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer, each step seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. The numbers are increasing exponentially, which makes sense given the repeated multiplication by 3. Let me check a couple of the layers again to be sure. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That seems right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's accurate. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Right. Then, 3*29524: Let's do this multiplication again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem to match my previous result. Wait, maybe I did the digit-by-digit multiplication incorrectly. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carryover 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carryover 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 87,8572? That can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572, which is what I got earlier. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet me write each step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right, we have 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88,572. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check could be to compute the value using a different approach, maybe recognizing a pattern or formula. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It resembles a geometric series, perhaps? Let me try to model it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. The entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nThis seems consistent with my earlier calculations. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me try to derive it.\n\nSuppose we have a general case where each layer is defined as L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Then, we can write L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is building a number in base 3. Wait, let me see: Each time we have 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to building digits in base 3. Let me try to see if that's the case.\n\nIf we consider each layer as a digit in base 3, starting from the innermost, which is 4. Hmm, but 4 in base 3 is 11, which might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the entire expression can be seen as a number in base 3 where each digit is 1, but I'm not sure. Let me try to explore this.\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I write it out, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). This is similar to a number in base 3 with digits 1 at each position, but extended multiple times. For example, a number like 111...1 in base 3 would evaluate to (3^n -1)/2, which is similar to what we have here. Wait, that's exactly the formula we derived earlier: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in this case, L9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nSo, this alternative perspective also aligns with the mathematical derivation.\n\nJust to ensure I haven't made any calculation errors, let me recompute a few key steps.\n\nCompute L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\n3*29524=88,572.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me write down the results so far: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Let me check if I can see a pattern or a formula here. Each layer seems to be 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, mathematically, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for this instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about this. The recursive formula is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I've already computed. For Layer 1 (n=1): (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Layer 4 (n=4): (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Great, so the formula works for the layers I've calculated. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since the original problem has nine layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, the value of the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Let me check the original expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 13, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, I need to compute Layer 9 first and then multiply by 3. Using the formula, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. First, verifying the formula for Layer n: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=1: (9 - 1)/2=4, correct. n=2: (27 -1)/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=40, correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=121, correct. So, the formula is correct. Then, for n=9: 3^{10}=59049, correct. 59049 -1=59048, correct. 59048 /2=29524, correct. Then, 29524*3: 29524*3. Let me compute it again step by step: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524*3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading from the top: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Calculating the 9th layer gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let's do that. 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to slip up with all these multiplications. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Sometimes when breaking down numbers, it's easy to miscompute.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, write down 8.\nThere are no more digits, so write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me quickly recap:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, all the layers seem to be correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and each time, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, this is similar to a recursive sequence where each term is a function of the previous one.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nNow, I wonder if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. It seems like each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the multiplier and c is the constant.\n\nIn this case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1))*r^{n-1}\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences.\n\nFor a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is:\n\na_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*( (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) )\n\nBut in this case, our initial term is a_1 = 4, not a_0. So, let's adjust for that.\n\nLet me reindex the sequence to start at n=0. Let\u2019s define a_0 = 4, then the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 for n >=1.\n\nThen, using the formula, the solution is:\n\na_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*( (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) )\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = 3^{n}*4 + (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nCombine terms:\n\na_n = (8*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nGiven a_0 = 4.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 should be 13.\n\nUsing the formula: (9*3^{1} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nAt n=2, a_2 = 40.\n\nFormula: (9*3^{2} -1)/2 = (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=3: (9*27 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which matches a_3 = 121.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems correct.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9, but in our formula, n starts at 0. So, a_9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nWait, in our original problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1 in the formula. Wait, no, actually, in our initial setup, a_1 was the first layer, which is 4, but in the formula, a_0 is 4. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the indices. Let me think again.\n\nIn the problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4, which I called a_1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9.\n\nBut in the formula, a_0 = 4, a_1 = 13, etc.\n\nSo, to align the indices, the innermost layer a_1 in the problem corresponds to a_0 in the formula.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9 in the problem, corresponds to a_8 in the formula.\n\nWait, that might complicate things, but perhaps it's better to think that the formula gives a_n for n starting at 0, where a_0 = 4.\n\nSo, in the problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which is a_0 in the formula. Then, a_2 in the problem is a_1 in the formula, and so on, up to a_9 in the problem, which is a_8 in the formula.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer in the problem is a_8 in the formula.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_8 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^8.\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, 3^8 = 6561.\n\nThen, a_8 = (9*6561 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 9*6561:\n\n9*6000 = 54000\n9*500 = 4500\n9*61 = 549\n\nSo, 54000 + 4500 = 58500\n58500 + 549 = 59049\n\nSo, 9*6561 = 59049.\n\nThen, a_8 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the Layer 9 result I got earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized this pattern as a geometric series and used the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(...). If I expand this, it might resemble a geometric series.\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, this method also gives me the same result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. As I did earlier, solving this recurrence gives a closed-form expression, which can then be used to compute the value without having to compute each layer individually. However, since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each layer step by step is feasible and straightforward.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that the numbers grow quite rapidly because each term is being multiplied by 3, leading to exponential growth. This is a characteristic of geometric sequences, where each term is a constant multiple of the previous term. In this case, the multiplier is 3, so each layer is three times the previous one plus 1, which still leads to exponential growth.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to express the entire original expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E:\n\nE = 1 + 3\n\nThen, working outward:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3*E\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, up to E9.\n\nBut as we've seen, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is the same recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it would look like:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nExpanding this would result in a sum where each term is 3 raised to a certain power, multiplied by 1. Let me try to see if that's the case.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81\n\nAnd so on, each time adding another term of 3^n.\n\nSo, each E_n is a sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\nAt E9: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nE8: 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nE7: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, indeed, each E_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is a geometric series.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by S_n = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, r = 3, so S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nFor E9: n=1, sum = 1 + 3 = 4. Using the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor E8: n=2, sum = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Formula: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor E7: n=3, sum = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Formula: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, each E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is E1, which is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, since there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost layer is E9, which is the sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k. Then, each outer layer adds another term. So, E8 is the sum up to k=2, E7 up to k=3, etc., until E1 is the sum up to k=9.\n\nWait, no, let's think carefully.\n\nThe innermost layer is E9: 1 + 3 = sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k.\n\nThen, E8 is 1 + 3*(E9) = 1 + 3*(sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k) = 1 + 3 + 9 = sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k.\n\nSimilarly, E7 = 1 + 3*(E8) = 1 + 3*(sum from k=0 to k=2) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = sum from k=0 to k=3.\n\nSo, each E_n = sum from k=0 to k=(10 - n) of 3^k.\n\nWait, because there are 9 layers, so E9 corresponds to n=1, E8 to n=2, etc., up to E1 corresponding to n=9.\n\nTherefore, E1 = sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nSo, E1 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, E1 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich is the same as Layer 9 in our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*E1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the answer.\n\nThis makes sense because each time we're adding another term in the geometric series by expanding the parentheses. So, the entire expression simplifies to 3 times the sum of a geometric series with 10 terms (from 3^0 to 3^9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our previous result.\n\nSo, this is another way to arrive at the same answer, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series.\n\nThis is helpful because it shows that sometimes, even if a problem looks complicated with many nested parentheses, it can be simplified by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nIn summary, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the entire expression as a geometric series, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work and considered multiple approaches to solving the problem, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns and using formulas can simplify even seemingly complex problems.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing it as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to exponential growth. By expanding step by step or using the geometric series formula, we find the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if that's the case. Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yes, that's the same as before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from the innermost term. But since each term is added 1 before multiplying by 3, it's a bit more involved. The closed-form approach seems more efficient and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. But since I already computed each layer and got the same result as the closed-form method, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Hmm, let's see. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's verify that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3 is 88572. That's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer individually. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as n=1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that these numbers are growing rapidly. Maybe there's a pattern or a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a recurrence relation here. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost layer is a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each layer builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression, but since each term is built from the previous, it's more of a recursive computation. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have something like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n can be expressed in terms of the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c - 1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n-1}*(a_1 + d/(c - 1)) - d/(c - 1). Let me verify that. Let me take n=1: a_1 = 4. Plugging into the formula: c^{0}*(4 + 1/(3 - 1)) - 1/(3 - 1) = 1*(4 + 0.5) - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Using the formula: 3^{1}*(4 + 0.5) - 0.5 = 3*4.5 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Formula: 3^2*(4 + 0.5) - 0.5 = 9*4.5 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = 3^{n-1}*(4.5) - 0.5. Simplifying, that's a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me see: (9/2)*3^{n-1} is equal to (3^{2})*3^{n-1}/2 = 3^{n+1}/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's another way to write it. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, that's a neat formula. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me confirm: The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2 =13, up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I get the same result. It's reassuring that both methods lead to the same answer. So, I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct value for the given expression.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the outermost layer results in 29524.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 = 1092. So, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3. Let's do that step by step: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let me do that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, but when I multiplied, I got a 6-digit number. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. Let me just go through the layers again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think the answer is correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to rapid growth. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer increases significantly, leading to the final large number. I guess that's why the answer is so big. It's kind of cool how these nested expressions can result in such large numbers so quickly. I think I've got it. The final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if this pattern continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's see, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, I think my calculations are correct.

So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. Let me write down the recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n-2*K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n9/2 = 3*C\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all the layers. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result more directly without computing each layer step by step. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. It's good to know both methods: one step-by-step computation for verification, and another using the closed-form formula for efficiency.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Recognized the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n- Started computing from the innermost parentheses outward.\n- Calculated each layer step by step.\n- Derived a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations.\n- Verified the formula with the computed values.\n- Applied the formula to find the final result without computing each layer.\n- Cross-checked both methods to ensure consistency.\n\nThis approach helps in understanding the problem deeply and ensures that the solution is correct. It's always good to verify using different methods if possible, especially when dealing with repetitive patterns or recursive structures.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is whether this expression has a known pattern or relates to a geometric series or another mathematical concept. Let me think about that.\n\nGiven that each layer is multiplied by 3, and we're adding 1 each time, it does resemble a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3. The formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, is similar to the sum of a geometric series. Specifically, the sum S of the first n terms of a geometric series with first term a and ratio r is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, the series is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, which sums to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's exactly the formula we have for a_n. So, each a_n is the sum of the geometric series up to 3^n. That's an interesting connection.\n\nTherefore, the expression is essentially summing a geometric series and then scaling it by 3. So, the entire expression can be seen as 3 times the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^9 (since there are nine layers). Wait, let me see: Each a_n is the sum up to 3^n, so a_9 would be the sum up to 3^9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives us 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572, as we found earlier.\n\nThis perspective might be useful for similar problems where recognizing the geometric series can lead to a quicker solution. It's always beneficial to relate problems to known mathematical concepts.\n\nIn summary, whether by step-by-step computation, deriving a recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series, all methods converge to the same result: 88572. This gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and repeating pattern.

Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.

Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Wow, these numbers are growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*120 first, which is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, and 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It looks like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a recursive formula. Maybe this is a geometric series or follows a specific pattern. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Each layer can be represented recursively, and I found a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression with nine layers of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{...})\\).

Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

So, I need to multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer individually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that Layer 1 = 4. So, plugging n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, if we consider n=0, which would be Layer 0 = 1 (since it's the base case before any layers), plugging n=0: Layer 0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) A + B = 1 Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 2: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, 3*Layer 9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recursive formula approach gave me the same result.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's see, 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this recurrence relation as: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can use the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + C => 4 = 3A + C. But we need another condition to solve for A and C. Alternatively, we can find the steady-state solution by setting a_n = a_{n-1} = a. Then, a = 1 + 3a => a - 3a = 1 => -2a = 1 => a = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = B*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = B*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3B - 1/2 => 3B = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => B = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to derive a closed-form formula to compute the value without having to manually calculate each layer, which would have been time-consuming and error-prone. It's interesting how recognizing such patterns can simplify complex-looking problems. I think I understand this better now. So, yeah, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. I can break this down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me verify 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula that can be applied here. The expression inside is a repeated multiplication by 3, so it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous one plus 1. But since it's nested, it's a bit more involved. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this recurrence, we can look for a pattern or find a closed-form expression. Let's try to compute a few terms and see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 a_3 = 40 a_4 = 121 a_5 = 364 a_6 = 1093 a_7 = 3280 a_8 = 9841 a_9 = 29524 Hmm, these numbers look familiar. Let me see if they relate to powers of 3. Let's compute powers of 3 up to 3^9: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 Now, let's see if a_n relates to 3^{n+1} or something like that. Let's compute a_1: 4 vs 3^2 = 9. Not quite. a_2: 13 vs 3^3 = 27. Not quite. a_3: 40 vs 3^4 = 81. Not matching. Maybe a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2? Let's test this. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct, that's a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct, that's a_2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct, that's a_3. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 121. Correct, that's a_4. So, it seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's a useful formula. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value we got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can compute each layer without having to compute each step manually. That's a good time-saver, especially if the expression were longer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure everything is clear: 1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression. 2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, working outward. 3. Notice the pattern and derive a formula for each layer. 4. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer efficiently. 5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. I think that covers everything. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value can be computed using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Recognizing this as a geometric series, a closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) is derived. Applying this formula to the outermost layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, which is Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay. Let me do Layer 4 now: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. I'm noticing a pattern here, but maybe it's better to just keep computing each layer step by step to avoid mistakes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, and 3*1=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me check one more time, perhaps by computing from the inside using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to represent it recursively. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, where a_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in this case, c is 1, and r is 3. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 as the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7. Then, the total expression is 3*a_8.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on until a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, the number of layers is 9, so n=9.\n\nIn any case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_n, we have a formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute it as 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; and the 3 is from the ten-thousands place. So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I was computing the layers, I might have made a mistake because the numbers are growing rapidly, and I want to make sure each step is accurate. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. Wait, but that seems like a big number. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's 9 layers. So, my computation seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me think again. Sometimes when you have these nested expressions, you can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). That's a recurrence relation. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be Layer n = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it another way. Let me consider the expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me see if I can find a pattern. Let me define each layer as before, but perhaps find a closed-form expression. Alternatively, since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation, and both methods give the same result, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a recurrence relation, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
