Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there was a pattern or a formula I could apply instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for example, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is Layer 3. So, this seems correct. Now, if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might save me time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is useful for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, it's manageable either way. I think I've verified it sufficiently, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the carryover. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through the layers again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), which would mean that after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3, giving 88572. But let me just double-check the structure of the expression. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are nine layers inside the outermost 3. So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, the innermost layer is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly, which is 59049, then subtract 1 to get 59048, divide by 2 to get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've covered all the steps and even cross-verified using a different method, so I don't see any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually is feasible. However, if I wanted to generalize, I could solve the recurrence relation. Let's try that for fun.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought of it, I thought maybe each layer is 3*(previous layer +1), but no, the structure is 1 + 3*(...). So each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, the way I computed each layer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. So, yes, 59049 minus 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a pattern or a mathematical formula that could represent this without computing each layer manually.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step or using the derived formula, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. 2*3=6.

Maybe I can compute a few layers manually to confirm.\n\nFor example, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40.

Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So yes, after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition and find a pattern.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute a few terms to see if we can spot a pattern.\n\nWe have:\n\nL_1=4\n\nL_2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nL_3=1 + 3*13=40\n\nL_4=1 + 3*40=121\n\nL_5=1 + 3*121=364\n\nL_6=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nL_7=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nL_8=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nL_9=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I can add 29524 three times. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add them up: 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my layers because the number seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, that's the final answer. But wait, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, carryover 0. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 3*3=9 +2=11. So writing that out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.

Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0. There are no more digits, so we're done. So the result is 88572.

But with carryover, it's better to compute each step:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7.

Write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier without computing each layer. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or something.\n\nLooking at each layer, each Layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if I can find a general formula for Layer n, that might save time. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is of the form:\n\nLayer n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into this form:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1)\n\nAssume Layer n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen Layer(n) = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: Layer 1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using the formula as well.\n\nSince Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*Layer9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3*Layer9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step, which is good because if the problem had more layers, this formula would save a lot of time.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Verify the result by finding a general formula using the recurrence relation.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the result directly, confirming that it matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that Layer 9 equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would save me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Wait, but in this case, a_1 is 1 +3=4, a_2=1 +3*4=13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it using the recurrence relation method. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)}= C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1= C*3^1 -1/2=3C -1/2=4. Solving for C: 3C=4 +1/2=9/2, so C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula. a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since the number of layers isn't too large (nine layers), expanding step by step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n, which might help verify my result.\n\nGiven the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly. The expression given is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost layer is a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Wait, no, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1=4, then the next is 1 + 3*a_1= a_2=13, and so on, up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, which gives the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times 29524\\).\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer. Because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent ones will be wrong. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840; so 9000+840=9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, I reach the outermost one, which is Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, so it's a homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*something, and that something is similar to the original expression but shorter. So, it's recursive.\n\nBut since I already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it with the step-by-step computation, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked everything, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n be the value of the nth layer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution for this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the 9th Layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 2, 8, 6? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then +9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when I'm doing nested computations, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers I computed. Starting from Layer 1 as the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I computed. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, maybe I should derive it step by step. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, a_4=1+3*40=121, etc. Hmm, this looks like a geometric progression. Let's see if we can find a pattern. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a_{n-1}, and so on. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} Similarly, continuing this, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1. Wait, but a_1 is 4, so it's not zero. Wait, perhaps I should adjust for the initial condition. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P =1 => P= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe it's better to do it step by step. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000 9000 *3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 =4 a_2 = 1 +3*a_1 =1 +3*4=13 a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40 a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +3*40=121 a_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +3*121=364 a_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +3*364=1093 a_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3*1093=3280 a_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +3*3280=9841 a_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +3*9841=29524 So, the same as before. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Therefore, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the final step is to compute 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the formula. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses: Starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds one more. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

How would that compute?\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d740 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, expanding step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen, 3\u00d74=12, so next layer: 1+12=13\n\nThen, 3\u00d713=39, next layer: 1+39=40\n\nFinally, 3\u00d740=120. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d74=13\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d713=40\n\nNext: 1 + 3\u00d740=121\n\nThen, 3\u00d7121=363\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, Layer 4 would be 121, then 3\u00d7121=363. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, which has 9 layers, I get 88572 as the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing another layer beyond Layer 3 to see if the pattern holds.\n\nCompute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) up to 9 layers.\n\nAs before, each layer adds 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nSo, with each layer, the value is 1 + 3*(previous value). So, the sequence goes:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but shifted by 1 each time. However, since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1, it's a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence relation can be found, but since it's a finite number of terms (9 layers), computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, for the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if this holds:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, let's see if a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, which matches a_4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364, which matches a_5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, which matches a_6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280, which matches a_7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841, which matches a_8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches a_9=29524.\n\nYes, so the closed-form formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. By systematically calculating each layer and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe breaking it down differently would be better. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 3*3=9, write down 9. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 3*3=9, write 9. Wait, that seems like too many digits. Let me count the digits in 29524: It's a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So when I multiply by 3, I should have:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nThen, since there are no more digits, the carry 2 is added as 2, but wait, that's not right because 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 +4. So when multiplying by 3, each digit is multiplied and carries are handled. So, let's do it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the carries. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7   3\n-------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So, is that the final answer? Let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the innermost layers are correct, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my multiplication because sometimes when you're dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times to verify:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and making sure each multiplication and addition is correct, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Substitute Layer 1 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Substitute Layer 2 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Substitute Layer 3 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Substitute Layer 4 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Substitute Layer 5 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Substitute Layer 6 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Substitute Layer 7 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Substitute Layer 8 into the next parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication another way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can recognize here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the prior. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. And so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. So, a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 29000 * 3 = 87000, 524 * 3 = 1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous. Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer follows a pattern, maybe even a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: L_1 = A*3 + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*9 + B = 13. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with the values we have: For n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 29524 *3 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that with another method. 29524 *3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized instead of computing each layer. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to expanding a geometric series but with a twist. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a sum. Let me think: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). If I expand it, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 +3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms, but I'm not sure. Wait, let's see. Let me try expanding the entire expression. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count how many 3s are being multiplied. Each time, it's 3*(something). So, the outermost is 3* something, which is 3*(1 +3*(...)), so that's 3^1*(1) + 3^2*(1) + ... up to 9 layers? Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(inner). So, when you expand, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))). So, expanding this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, let me try expanding it step by step. Let's see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand the innermost first: The innermost is 1 +3=4. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13, then 1 +3*13=40, and so on, as before. Alternatively, if I fully expand E, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))))). Each time, expanding a layer adds another power of 3. So, after expanding all layers, E would be 3*1 +3^2*1 +3^3*1 +...+3^9*1. Wait, is that true? Let me check with the first few layers. For example, if I have E = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))). Let's compute this: Innermost:1+3=4. Next layer:1+3*4=13. Next layer:1+3*13=40. Then E=3*40=120. Alternatively, expanding: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(13))=3*(40)=120. Now, if I expand it as a sum: 3*1 +3^2*1 +3^3*1. So, 3 +9 +27=39. But 39\u2260120. So, that approach isn't correct. Hmm, so my initial thought that it's a sum of 3^k from k=1 to 9 is wrong. So, that method doesn't work. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation. Since we've already done that, and both methods give the same result, I think 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a base-3 number or something, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a geometric series in terms of powers of 3. Wait, let me see: From the recurrence relation, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace the layers to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k-1). Wait, in this case, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Let me see: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start, but since I was computing each layer step by step, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result.

That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, but in this case, the initial term is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, just computing each layer step by step is also feasible, although it's a bit more time-consuming. Either way, the answer seems to be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. Let me think if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So, that's a good check.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is built with 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...), the formula gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{10} -1)*3/2 = (59049 -1)*3/2 = 59048*3/2 = (59048*3)/2.\n\nCompute 59048 * 3: 59048 * 3 = 177144, then divide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it in general to find a formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to nine layers.\n\nIf I let E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight layers.\n\nBut this might not directly help. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, another approach: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost part as x, so x = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3x, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), etc.\n\nBut perhaps using the formula I derived earlier is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, I've computed each layer step by step, and using the formula, I arrived at the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using this method, each layer is computed step by step until reaching the outermost layer. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, I could look for a pattern or formula that might represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. That's a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers is large. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, though it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me just verify the arithmetic one more time to be absolutely sure. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in base 3, but I don't know if that's directly applicable here. But the recurrence relation approach worked well.\n\nI guess the key takeaway here is recognizing the pattern in the nested expressions and being able to model it with a recurrence relation. That makes solving the problem much more straightforward, especially if there are many layers. Instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone, setting up the recurrence relation allows for a quick computation using the formula.\n\nSo, in summary, by breaking down the problem layer by layer and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute the value step by step and then confirm it using a closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we compute each layer step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**:\n   - Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer.\n   - The recurrence is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around with 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, how many layers of 1 + 3*(...) are there before the final multiplication by 3?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the layers are as I computed: Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final 3 multiplication. So, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution a_p.\n\nAssume a_p is a constant, so a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but it's a bit more involved because each term adds 1. But the recurrence approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nIn any case, I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, and also used the recurrence relation to confirm that the 9th layer is 29524, leading to the final result of 88572. I think that's solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe final result is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carry 0. Next: 9*3=27, write 27. So putting it all together: 27852. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, write 7 and carry 2, but wait, we're at the end, so we write 27. So the number would be 27852. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carry 0. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. But since there are no more digits, we write the 27 as 27 at the beginning. So the result is 27852. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit. 4 + 4 = 8. 8 + 2 = 10, carry 1. 4 + 5 = 9 +1=10, carry 1. 0 + 9 = 9 +1=10, carry 1. 9 + 2 = 11 +1=12, carry 1. 5 + 9 =14 +1=15, carry 1. 2 + 2=4 +1=5. So writing it down: 5 (from the last carry), 15, 12, 10, 10, 8. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I should do it step by step: 59048 + 29524: Let's write them aligned:\n\n  59048\n+ 29524\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n0 + 5 =5. Write 5.\n\n9 + 9 =18. Write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 =7 +1=8. Write 8.\n\nNow, the next digit: 5 + nothing, since 29524 has only 5 digits. So 5 remains as is. So the sum is 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88572, but earlier I thought it was 27852, which is way off. Wait, I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me check again: 29524 *3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\n9*3=27. Write down 7, carry over 2, but since there are no more digits, we write 27 at the beginning. So the number is 27852? But when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572, which is different. So clearly, I'm making a mistake in my multiplication. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500 *3=1500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I messed up the digit positions when I was multiplying. Let me try again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8, carry 0.\n\n9*3=27. Since there are no more digits, write 27 before the previous digits. So the result is 27852. Wait, but that's not matching with the addition method. I must have misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8, carry 0.\n\nNow, there's a 9 at the start of 29524, so 9*3=27. But since we're at the end, we write 27 before the previous digits. So the result is 27852. But wait, that's conflicting with the addition method. Let me check with a calculator. Wait, I don't have a calculator, but I can do 29524*3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nCompute 30000*3=90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 90000 - (476*3)=90000 -1428=88572. Yes, that's correct. So where did I go wrong in the multiplication? I think I misaligned the digits when writing down the result. Let me try again:\n\n29524\n*    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 in front. So the result is 88572. Wait, that makes sense. So earlier, I must have missed that the 9 is the next digit after 2, so 2*3=6 +2=8, then the next digit is 9*3=27, which gives us 27 at the beginning. So the correct result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nK -3K =1\n\n-2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the value directly. Both methods confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
