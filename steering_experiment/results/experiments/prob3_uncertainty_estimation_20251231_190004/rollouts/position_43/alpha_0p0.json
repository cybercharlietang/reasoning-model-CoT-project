    "text": " 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 is 88572. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, each layer is computed correctly. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me check 3*9841 again. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, yes, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without breaking it into layers, just to cross-verify. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write down each step again: Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nWait a minute, this nested expression seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with a ratio of 3 and some constant term. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, the closed-form approach is more straightforward.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers, step by step, just substituting each layer as I go. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute the innermost part first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent with everything else. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute each step using a calculator to verify the multiplications, just in case I made an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again with precise calculations:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. 1 + 363=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute this carefully. 29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we get 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, after verifying each step and even using a different method with the closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work multiple times. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer to the problem.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make an error. Let me recompute Layer 9 and the final multiplication. Starting again, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is following a pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We also know that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n will dominate unless A=0. However, in our case, each L_n is finite, so perhaps this approach isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, we can solve it iteratively, which is what I did earlier. Since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each step manually is feasible. If it were a larger number, we might look for a pattern or a formula, but for 9 layers, step-by-step computation is straightforward. So, after computing each layer, I arrived at L_9 = 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. To be absolutely sure, I can compute it using another method, perhaps by expanding the expression. Let's try expanding the innermost parentheses first and see how it goes. Starting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. I think it's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and proceed to the next. After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, actually, when multiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n\nThen, the next digit is 2 (from 29524), which is the ten-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + carryover 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572. So yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. But wait, I feel like that's a lot of layers. Let me count how many layers there are in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each step adds another 1+3(...). So from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen each time, we go out one layer. So in the original expression, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n... and so on, until the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer. Wait, so actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So that's nine layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So my initial computation was correct, with nine layers, leading to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Let me just verify one more time with a different approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. The expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the approach was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. Notice a pattern that each layer follows a recurrence relation.\n\n4. Derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation.\n\n5. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer directly.\n\n6. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThroughout this process, it's crucial to double-check each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers and large numbers, to avoid arithmetic errors. I made sure to verify each layer's computation and cross-validated using the closed-form formula, which gave me the same result. This makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially building upon the previous one, tripling the previous result and adding 1. This is a common structure in problems involving geometric progressions or exponential growth, which aligns with the recurrence relation approach I took.\n\nIn summary, by methodically breaking down each layer and applying a mathematical formula, I arrived at the solution without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. It's similar to a geometric series, perhaps. Let's try to find a general formula for Layer n. The recursive formula is: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is of the form: Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug this into the recurrence relation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers have integer values. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check my steps. The general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + B. Plug into recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Then, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, yes, B is -1/2. Then, to find A, we can use the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, Layer 1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. Therefore, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, A = 3/2 and B = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same result. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's it. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see if this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is growing exponentially. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recursive formula, we find the value of each layer. The innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous value by 3 and adding 1. This pattern follows a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Using this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that I can use to compute it more efficiently. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each layer is a function of the previous one. Let me denote each layer as L_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for the ninth layer, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, that's another way to look at it, and it still gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...).

Wait, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\nThen each step out adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of times I see 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n- And so on, until the outermost.\n\nLet me count the number of layers by counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.

So, the first 1+3 is layer 1, the next is layer 2, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the expression, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3(...).

Let me try to compute each layer again, but this time, I'll make sure I count the layers correctly.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct. But I'm a bit unsure because the number is quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me try computing Layer 9 again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(Layer n). So, the total number of layers is 9, and then we multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 0, but actually, it's simpler to recognize that this is a first-order linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution can be found using iteration.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as we can see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let's test the formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nThus, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3 * 20 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n3 * 4 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I compute 29524 * 3, I can also do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\". Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(...)\n3. Repeating until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each step out adds another layer. Let's count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, when I wrote down the layers, I had Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But perhaps I miscounted the layers because the original expression might have 9 layers. Let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. Repeating until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each step out adds another layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\" until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. The first one after the initial 3: 3(1+3(...)\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)): that's the second layer.\n3. Repeating until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds a closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses in the expression:\n\nFrom the innermost, each layer adds one closing parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is the first closing parenthesis at the end: ...1+3)))\n\nThen each layer out adds another closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3: I see nine closing parentheses. So that would mean there are nine layers, each adding a closing parenthesis. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is the one before the initial 3. So, I think my initial calculation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm by computing each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 \u21d2 L_p - 3*L_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*L_p = 1 \u21d2 L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly, which is 59049, then subtract 1 to get 59048, divide by 2 to get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} is 59049.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I can confidently say the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\n1.

Let me check my calculations because that might be a mistake. Let me recalculate Layer 9: Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841. So, 3*9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised by the size of the number. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier layers? Let me check each layer again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That way, I don't have to compute each layer manually, which is especially useful if the number of layers is larger. But since there were only nine layers, both methods worked fine. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches gave me the same result, which is reassuring.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting again with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this multiplication again to make sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around. Let me count the number of 1+3 inside each other. The innermost is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3( parts. Starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer out adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3( appears. Let me count: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer is 3(1+3(...). Then each inner layer adds another 1+3(, so let's see how many there are. Let's see: From the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then the next is 1+3*(Layer 1), that's Layer 2. Then 1+3*(Layer 2) is Layer 3. Continuing, Layer 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10? Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write out the layers as they are nested:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, my initial counting was correct with 9 layers, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. So, I think my calculation is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like this can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the problem is to compute a_9, and then multiply by 3. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since the recurrence is linear, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n9/2 = 3*C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer after verifying it through both iterative computation and finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers inside the initial multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define the layers more formally. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n ranges from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation because of the constant term 1. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n9/2 = 3A\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\nL_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I can also check this using the formula for L_n. Since the expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it together: 6 8 2 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, let me write it properly: 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17 \u2192 7, carryover 1.\n\nWait, wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here because 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n\n   \u00d7        3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started by identifying that the expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one (Layer 1) and moving outward to Layer 9. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer's result by 3 and added 1. After computing Layer 9, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. All my intermediate steps checked out, and the arithmetic seems correct. So, I feel confident that the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a few layers again or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this. Alternatively, I could consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can recognize it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => Subtract 3C from both sides: -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to see if I can spot any discrepancies. Using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's compute a_1 to a_9: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers match the formula, which gives me even more confidence. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miss any layers, let me recount. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). Each time, the next layer is 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, the first inner is 1+3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" from the innermost. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer is 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let me see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add a layer. So, the expression has 9 layers because after the initial 3, there are 8 more layers? Wait, no, let me see. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of closing parentheses: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds a closing parenthesis. Let's see: The expression ends with nine closing parentheses? Wait, the expression is 3 followed by 8 sets of (1+3(...)). Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another opening parenthesis. Let me count them: Starting after the first 3(, then each 1+3( adds another. So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, meaning there are 8 layers? Wait, no, because each layer is a set of parentheses. Let me think differently. Let me write the expression as follows, with each layer:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) up to Layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(innermost)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nNext: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nNext: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nNext: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nNext: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nNext: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nNext: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88,572\n\nWait, so that's 8 layers after the innermost. So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then up to Layer 8, and then multiplied by 3. So, total layers inside the 3 are 8, making the total expression 3*(Layer 8). So, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside the initial 3. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*9841=29523\n\nWait, no, because the expression is 3*(Layer 8). Wait, no, the expression is 3*(Layer 8). Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3=4\n\nThen Layer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841=29523\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers because I included the initial 3*(...). So, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 8), where Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), etc., down to Layer 1:1 +3.\n\nSo, the total number of layers inside the initial 3 is 8, making the total expression 3*(Layer 8). So, Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841=29523. Wait, but earlier I had 8 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 =1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E=3*Layer9=3*29524=88,572\n\nWait, but in this case, the original expression is 3*(Layer9), but the original expression has 9 layers inside the initial 3. Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(Layer9), but the innermost is Layer1, so total layers inside are 9, making E=3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression, it's 8. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses: each \"1+3(\" adds one. So, that would mean 8 layers inside the initial 3. So, Layer1 to Layer8.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I think I included the initial 3 as Layer9, which is incorrect. So, perhaps the correct number of layers inside the initial 3 is 8, leading to Layer8=9841, then E=3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let me define each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, for n=1: a1=4\n\nn=2: a2=1 +3*4=13\n\nn=3: a3=1 +3*13=40\n\nn=4: a4=1 +3*40=121\n\nn=5: a5=1 +3*121=364\n\nn=6: a6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nn=7: a7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nn=8: a8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nn=9: a9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nBut the original expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(a9), but the expression has only 8 layers inside the initial 3. So, perhaps I'm including one extra layer. Let me recount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 +3), then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). Let me count the number of layers inside the initial 3:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3) =4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses: each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, that's 8 layers. So, the innermost is Layer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer8=3*9841=29523\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the innermost was Layer1, then up to Layer9, which would be 29524, but that might be incorrect because the number of layers inside the initial 3 is 8, not 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the number of layers is determined by the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3. Let's count them:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 Layer1:1+3=4\n\n2. 3(1+3(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer2:1+3*4=13\n\n3. 3(1+3(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3:1+3*13=40\n\n4. 3(1+3(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4:1+3*40=121\n\n5. 3(1+3(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5:1+3*121=364\n\n6. 3(1+3(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6:1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 3(1+3(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 3(1+3(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 3(1+3(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 8 layers inside the initial 3, so perhaps I'm counting one extra. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3( \u2192 Layer1\n\n2. 1+3( \u2192 Layer2\n\n3. 1+3( \u2192 Layer3\n\n4. 1+3( \u2192 Layer4\n\n5. 1+3( \u2192 Layer5\n\n6. 1+3( \u2192 Layer6\n\n7. 1+3( \u2192 Layer7\n\n8. 1+3( \u2192 Layer8\n\n9. 1+3) \u2192 This is the innermost, which is Layer1:1+3=4\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it by writing the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define the innermost expression as E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 =1 +3*13=40\n\nE4 =1 +3*E3=1 +3*40=121\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +3*121=364\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +3*364=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88,572\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(E9), which would be 3*(29524)=88,572\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 8 layers inside, so perhaps E9 is outside the initial 3. Wait, no, because the initial expression is 3*(E9). So, perhaps I'm correct with 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check: The original expression is 3*(E9), where E9=29524, so 3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the number of layers inside the initial 3 is 8, leading to E8=9841, then 3*E8=29,523. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me approach it differently. Let me count the number of closing parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first closing parenthesis is after the first 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses.\n\nStarting from the end: The expression ends with nine closing parentheses: ))))))))).\n\nWait, no, let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nFrom the end, it's ))))))))).\n\nWait, no, the expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), so the number of closing parentheses is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers as the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the expression is (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"1+3(\" is Layer1, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" is another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. (1+3( \u2192 Layer1\n\n2. 1+3( \u2192 Layer2\n\n3. 1+3( \u2192 Layer3\n\n4. 1+3( \u2192 Layer4\n\n5. 1+3( \u2192 Layer5\n\n6. 1+3( \u2192 Layer6\n\n7. 1+3( \u2192 Layer7\n\n8. 1+3( \u2192 Layer8\n\n9. 1+3) \u2192 Layer9\n\nWait, but that's 9 layers, but the expression ends with ))))))))).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 8 \"1+3(\" instances, each adding a new layer. So, that's 8 layers, meaning that the innermost is Layer8:1+3=4\n\nThen, Layer7:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer6:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer5:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer4:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer3:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer2:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer1:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer1=3*9841=29,523\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Now I'm really confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that each layer adds a new term, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3, which is 8 times. So, starting from the innermost as Layer1, up to Layer8, then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, Layer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer8=3*9841=29,523\n\nBut earlier, I had 3*(Layer9)=88,572. Now I'm getting two different results based on how I count the layers. This is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to approach it differently. Let me write the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define E1 as the innermost expression: E1=1+3=4\n\nThen, E2=1+3*E1=1+12=13\n\nE3=1+3*E2=1+39=40\n\nE4=1+3*E3=1+120=121\n\nE5=1+3*E4=1+363=364\n\nE6=1+3*E5=1+1092=1093\n\nE7=1+3*E6=1+3279=3280\n\nE8=1+3*E7=1+9840=9841\n\nE9=1+3*E8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88,572\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(E9), which is 3*(29524)=88,572\n\nBut according to this, there are 9 layers: E1 to E9. But the original expression only has 8 layers inside the initial 3. So, perhaps E9 is outside the initial 3, making the total expression 3*E9=88,572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is E1=1+3, then each layer adds up to E8=1+3*E7, and then the outermost is 3*E8.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how I'm counting the layers. Let me try to write the expression with indices.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 =1 +3*13=40\n\na_4 =1 +3*a_3=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 8 layers inside the initial 3. So, perhaps a_9 is outside the initial 3, making the total expression 3*a_8=3*9841=29,523\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the expression structure. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3=4\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 8 inside the initial 3.\n\nThus, the innermost is Layer1:4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer8=3*9841=29,523\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the innermost was Layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another, leading to Layer9, but perhaps that's incorrect because the original expression only has 8 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is 29,523, not 88,572. Let me verify.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the expression is 3*(Layer8), where Layer8=9841, so 3*9841=29,523\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, if I have 9 layers, leading to 88,572, but that might be incorrect because the original expression only has 8 layers inside the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the expression is 3*(a_8), where a_8=9841, so 3*9841=29,523\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting results based on how I count the layers.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step again just to be sure. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's define Ln as 1 + 3*Ln-1, where L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is going to be of the form Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let's assume the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. Then, the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume Ln^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a closed-form solution. So, in summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or by finding the general formula using recurrence relations, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(L_n\\) represent the value at the nth layer.

Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I only need to compute up to a_9, it's probably faster to compute each term step by step as I did before. But just to understand the pattern, let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. This makes me confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, the 3 is being multiplied by the previous term, which itself is a sum. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each term is nested, it's actually a finite geometric series of depth 9, multiplied by 3. But I think the approach I took initially is more straightforward for this problem. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88,572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\). Solving this step by step:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the inside out:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2.

But let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Then, after computing all nine layers, the outermost 3 is multiplied by that result. So, the final value is 88572.

So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I computed each layer up to Layer 9, I got Layer 9 as 29524.

Maybe breaking it down differently would help. 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 4 * 3 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 13.

That matches my earlier result. So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...)\n\nThen each 1+3(...) is wrapped in another 1+3(...), so each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, if I start with the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, up to Layer 9 being the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed step by step. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recursive formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all my steps, and everything adds up. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the nesting, it might be correct. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

That seems correct as well. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, Layer 9 is the innermost expression, but wait, let me check: The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer 8, and so on. Wait, actually, when I numbered the layers, Layer 1 was the innermost, and Layer 9 was the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9 in the recurrence. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting again from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

Let me compute this more carefully: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result. Maybe it's correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution as a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something like that. Let me see: Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the geometric series. Each layer is a term in a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, starting from 1. So, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. Wait, but in our case, the expression is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(...), so it's more like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. But in any case, the formula we derived earlier gives us the correct result, so I think 88572 is the right answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. After computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Verify the result using a different method (recurrence relation formula) to ensure accuracy. 5. Both methods gave the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct. I think that covers all the steps. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. So that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, actually, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then 29524 *3 is 88572. Yep, that's solid.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might miscalculate a layer. Let me go back through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279, so 3279 +1=3280. Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.) Now, 3*29524: Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each term inside the parentheses can be represented as a geometric series. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, this method also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which, when expanded, would be a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to write it out. Starting from the innermost part: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to see how the expansion would look. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But actually, since each layer is a term, maybe expanding E would give me a sum of 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but I need to think carefully. Wait, actually, each layer contributes a term. Let me try to see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me think recursively. If I let E_n be the expression with n layers, then E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}). So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so maybe E_1=4, then E_2=1 + 3*E_1=1+12=13, which is similar to the layers we computed earlier. Wait, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*E_9, where E_9 is the result of the innermost expression with nine layers. So, perhaps it's better to model it as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1=1 + 3=4, then E_2=1 + 3*4=13, etc., up to E_9=1 + 3*E_8=29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, then E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 1, which is the same recurrence as before. So, solving it gives the same result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each time you add a layer, you're effectively adding another power of 3, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the sum using the formula for a geometric series. From the recurrence solution, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expansion of the expression, each layer adds a term, so the total sum inside would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand this, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1. Wait, because each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3 + 3^2, and so on. So, up to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, and then multiplied by 3. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8, and E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7, etc., then E_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, if I expand E_9, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1. So, E_9 = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches our earlier formula. So, E_9 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier we had a_9=29524, which was for n=9 in the a_n sequence. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices here.\n\nWait, in the a_n sequence, a_1=4, which is 1 + 3. Then a_2=13, which is 1 + 3*4. So, a_n corresponds to E_n in the problem. So, E_n = a_n, and E_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*E_9=88572.\n\nBut when I considered the sum up to 3^8, I got E_9 = (3^9 -1)/2=9841, which is different. So, perhaps there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers differently. Let me try to see.\n\nIf I consider the innermost layer as the first term, which is 1 + 3 = 4, that's layer 1: a_1=4.\n\nThen, layer 2 is 1 + 3*a_1=1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*a_2=1 + 3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to layer 9: a_9=1 + 3*a_8=29524.\n\nSo, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of a_9 as the sum of a geometric series, it's a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, which matches.\n\nSo, the sum inside is from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but when I thought of the sum up to 3^8, I was getting 9841, which is a_8=9841, which is correct because a_8=1 + 3*a_7=1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the sum is up to 3^8 or 3^9.\n\nBut in any case, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 gives the correct value for each layer.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to ensure, let me compute 3*(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\n3^{10}=59049, so 3^{10}-1=59048.\n\nDivide by 2: 59048/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^{11}/2 - 3/2.\n\n3^{11}=177147, so 177147/2=88573.5, and 88573.5 - 1.5=88572.\n\nThat also gives the same result.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a geometric progression, we find the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572 Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute it without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation here: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term 1. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, the value would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express this in terms of the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This results in the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 5: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and after computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have nine layers, then the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that seems correct. Let me recount the layers just to be sure. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Then inside, there are eight more opening parentheses. Wait, no, let me parse the expression correctly. The structure is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then an opening parenthesis, then 1 + 3(...). Each time, inside each parenthesis, there's another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each step out adds another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3(...) nested. Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(.... So, the first 3 is outside, then the first layer is 1 + 3(...), then each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3(...). So, in total, how many layers? Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. Wait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step again, perhaps in a table format, to avoid any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 29523 +1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find D. If we assume that a_n approaches a steady state as n increases, then a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods agree. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^{10} is indeed 59049.\n\nYes, 3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
