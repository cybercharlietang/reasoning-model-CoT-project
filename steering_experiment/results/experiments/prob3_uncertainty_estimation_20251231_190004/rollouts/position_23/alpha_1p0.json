    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 would be: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a jump. Let me check that again. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is indeed 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Now Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let's do that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, that might not be the best way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check 29524*3 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, each step seems correct, and the final result is 88572.

Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. Now Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Let me verify that multiplication: 121*3. 100*3 is 300, 20*3 is 60, 1*3 is 3, so 300+60+3=363. Add 1, you get 364. Correct.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step. First, 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the outermost layer is Layer 9, the value is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. It's a large number, but given the repeated multiplication by 3, it makes sense that it grows exponentially. So, yeah, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that expressions like this, where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(...), can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here that I can generalize, which might help confirm my answer.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute the entire expression without computing each layer, I could note that the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). So, that would be 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524=88572, which is the same result.\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But since there are only nine layers, either method works fine.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm it's 59049.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, 3^{10}=59049, so 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. So far, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Wait, 4, 13, 40... Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the whole thing. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such a sequence. Let me see. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can express this as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can derive a formula for each layer. The innermost layer is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This leads to a recurrence relation which can be solved to find a general formula for each layer. Using this formula, we compute the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Hmm, let's compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So we need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_{n} = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I've already computed. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, this formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing the result without calculating each layer manually. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence relation is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is: a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is: a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1, a_1=4. The outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result without computing each layer manually. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution is found to be \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For the 9th layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, because each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4, which is indeed 13. Okay, moving on. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with larger numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by taking 1 + 3 times the previous layer. There were nine layers in total, each adding another layer of 1 + 3*(previous). After computing each layer up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, I then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations when I went through each step, and the multiplication was verified by breaking it down. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's straightforward. Let me write that down. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572 Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers. It looks like each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula. This might be faster if there are many layers, but in this case, since there are only 9 layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to compute the result directly. 4. Verify the consistency between the step-by-step computation and the formula. 5. Conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me check. If Layer 1 is 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(4), which is 1 + 12, which is indeed 13. Okay, that seems right. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. I can also try to see if there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions, maybe using geometric series or something, but since each layer is just 1 + 3*(previous), it's a linear recurrence. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, I can express it as L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Wait, that's not matching L_1 which is 4. Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps it's L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me try that. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That matches. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. That's correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct again. So, the general formula for the nth layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.

Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" expressions. The innermost is just 1+3, then each layer wraps around the previous one. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times? Wait, no. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each time you add another \"1+3(\", so starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, if I have n layers, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2: 1+3(layer1). Up to layer 9. Wait, but in the original expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\", each time it's inside another \"1+3(\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The first \"1+3(\" after the first 3.\n2. Then another \"1+3(\" inside that.\n3. And so on, until the innermost is \"1+3\".\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3: 1+3(\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(\n3. Then another: 1+3(\n4. Another: 1+3(\n5. Another: 1+3(\n6. Another: 1+3(\n7. Another: 1+3(\n8. Another: 1+3(\n9. The innermost: 1+3\n\nWait, so there are 8 \"1+3(\" instances, meaning 8 layers, each wrapping around the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me recount the layers.\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1+3*(layer1)=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*(layer2)=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nWait, but if there are 8 \"1+3(\" instances, that would mean 8 layers, but I ended up with 9 layers. Hmm, perhaps I'm including the initial 3*(...) as a layer, but maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the outermost is 3 times (something). That something is 1 + 3*(something else). So, the first layer is the innermost 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(previous). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each layer wraps around:\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nEach time, adding another \"1+3(\" until we reach the outermost, which is 3*(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, each time we have another \"1+3(\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. The first one after the initial 3: 1+3(\n2. Then inside that: 1+3(\n3. Inside that: 1+3(\n4. Inside that: 1+3(\n5. Inside that: 1+3(\n6. Inside that: 1+3(\n7. Inside that: 1+3(\n8. Inside that: 1+3(\n9. The innermost: 1+3\n\nWait, so there are 8 \"1+3(\" instances, meaning 8 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, perhaps my earlier count of 9 layers is incorrect, and it should be 8 layers, meaning that when I computed up to Layer9, I went one layer too far.\n\nWait, let me check. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3\" expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen each time we have another 1+3 wrapping around:\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nUp to the outermost, which is 3*(1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many \"1+3\" expressions are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances, which is 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 \"1+3(\"s.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me count:\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nThe first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is the first occurrence.\n\nThen each subsequent \"1+3(\" is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\", each is a new layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. The first one after the initial 3: 1+3(\n2. Inside that: 1+3(\n3. Inside that: 1+3(\n4. Inside that: 1+3(\n5. Inside that: 1+3(\n6. Inside that: 1+3(\n7. Inside that: 1+3(\n8. Inside that: 1+3(\n9. The innermost: 1+3\n\nWait, that's 9 \"1+3(\" instances, including the innermost. So, perhaps there are 9 layers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the innermost \"1+3\" is a layer or not. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1).\n\nSimilarly, layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on, up to layer9, which is the outermost layer before the initial 3.\n\nWait, no. The initial 3 is outside the outermost layer.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer8), and so on, until layer1 is 1+3.\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total, each defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify each layer again.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...Layer 9...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and we just computed up to Layer 9 as 29524. But actually, let me count the layers again to make sure I haven't missed anything. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" inside the expression. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each time it's wrapped in another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count them: 1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the innermost part, and then each subsequent layer is built upon that. Wait, no, actually, when I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, then Layer 2 is the next one, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, in that case, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). But wait, in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then I thought the entire expression is 3 times that. But actually, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost part is 1+3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's see: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can check this by considering the pattern. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me verify that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2= (3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial condition. Let me see: a_1 =1 +3=4. So, the recurrence is a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D. Let me solve it: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)}=C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=D. Plugging into the recurrence: D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= C*3^{n} -1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. So, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the innermost layer computes to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the innermost value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 which is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 3*9841 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me just compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So that gives me 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) =7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\nSo yes, it's 88572. So the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to see if I messed up somewhere.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might be a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and maybe that would give me a faster way to compute the result without computing each layer step by step. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2=4. Solving for A: 3A=4 +1/2=9/2. So A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So from the innermost to the outermost, that's 9 layers. So n=9, so a_9 is correct. Therefore, yes, 88572 is the correct answer. I think that's solid. So, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. It feels good to cross-verify and make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes along the way. Math can be tricky, but breaking it down and checking each step definitely helps in avoiding errors.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each nested layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, so 7 with a carryover of 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 7 7 8 5 7 2 8 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524.

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step, and each time, I made sure to calculate the multiplication before adding 1, following the order of operations. I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result. I think I did each step correctly, but just to be thorough, let me check a couple of the layers again. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I did everything right. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's 13. Then Layer 3 would be: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's 40. Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's right. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, 121. Then Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So the final step is: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous. So Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I could have used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's probably faster to compute each term step by step as I did earlier. However, for practice, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since our layers go up to Layer 9, which is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that makes sense. So, Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 would be: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time, we're taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me write this down systematically to avoid confusion. Let's define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. So:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check L4 again. If L3 is 40, then 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yeah, that's correct. Okay, moving on.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing L9, which is the innermost part of the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9. But wait, let me check the structure again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is inside another 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, after computing L9, which is the innermost 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing L1 to L9, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me clarify. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from L1 as the innermost, L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, which is the innermost part of the outermost expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Therefore, after computing L9, we have to multiply it by 3 to get the final result. Let me confirm this structure. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is L1 = 4. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, let's compute each layer up to L9:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.

Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9. Let's go back and check each layer step by step again.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean there are nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, in total, there are nine layers, each with a 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, L1 to L9 as I computed.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*(13) = 39\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier computation. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the smaller example.\n\nWait, let's do it correctly.\n\nOriginal smaller expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but I thought it would be 39, but no, that's incorrect. Let me see. So, in the smaller case, with three layers inside the outermost 3*(...), we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, in that case, the result is 120.\n\nSimilarly, if I compute it using my layer method:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L3 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my method works for the smaller case.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the original problem, which has nine layers, I computed up to L9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, L1 to L9, then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did each step correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. It's a bit tedious, but since each layer only depends on the previous one, it's manageable. I guess another way to look at it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series or something, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is feasible. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression, but I don't recall it off the top of my head. I think computing each layer step by step is the most straightforward approach here, especially since the number of layers isn't too large. So, after computing each layer up to Layer 9, which gives me 29524, multiplying that by 3 gives me the final result of 88572.

Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the layers either. Each step was straightforward, just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's a repetitive process, but each layer built upon the previous one correctly. So, I think I'm good here. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, computing each layer step by step. That way, I didn't get overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire expression at once. Breaking it down made it manageable. I guess another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, it's just a linear operation, which is easy to compute. If I had tried to compute the entire expression all at once, I might have gotten lost in the parentheses and made a mistake. But by tackling each part individually, it became much simpler. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have given me the result without computing each layer. Maybe something related to geometric series or recursion? Let me think about that. Each layer is defined recursively as L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be L_k^h = A*3^k, and the particular solution would be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For Layer 1: k=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: k=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: k=3, L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Layer 4: k=4, L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct. Layer 5: k=5, L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 =364. Correct. Layer 6: k=6, L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 =1093. Correct. Layer 7: k=7, L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 =3280. Correct. Layer 8: k=8, L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 =19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct. Wow, that formula works perfectly! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly applied this formula for each layer. That would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, it wasn't too bad either way. Now, knowing that L_9 =29524, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572, which is what I computed earlier. So, this gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allows for a more efficient solution. I guess in the future, if I come across similar nested expressions, I can look for such patterns to simplify my work. But for now, I think I've solved the problem correctly. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Identify the nested structure and realize each layer can be computed individually. 2. Start from the innermost layer and compute each subsequent layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. 3. Once all layers are computed up to the ninth, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, I could compute each layer directly without iterative computation. Either way, the answer comes out to 88572. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer individually from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3. But that might not help. Alternatively, let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next digit: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next digit: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, putting it all together from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8, 7, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 29524 * 3 should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try another approach. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches what I had before. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). Yes, that seems consistent. Each step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, yes, the computations seem correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Continuing this way, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12.

So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but nested. Wait, maybe each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{part} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have nine layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which is what I computed before.\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is correctly accounted for. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, when I computed a_9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since it's nested, the formula applies as we derived.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But let me verify the multiplication just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking down 29524 incorrectly. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step seems to follow logically from the previous one. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, let me check the original problem again. It starts with 3(1 + 3(...)). So, actually, Layer 9 is the innermost part, and each layer wraps around it, so the outermost layer is Layer 9, and then we have the initial 3 multiplied by that. Wait, no, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*29,000 = 87,000 and 3*524 = 1,572. So, 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of layers is 9, as there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for the homogeneous solution, if we consider L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, the solution would be A*3^n. But since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, substitute B back into the initial condition equation: 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, which matches our earlier calculation. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which also matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we determine each layer's value step by step. The innermost layer is computed first, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the formula for the nth layer, we find the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recursive sequence.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Let L_n be the value of the nth layer. The recursive relation is:\n   - L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n   - With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution**:\n   - The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Layer 9**:\n   - For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is 88,572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to write it out as:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplying by 3, it should result in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12.

Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 30,000*3 - 476*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 1,093*3 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280*3 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 9,841*3 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 is 88,572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.

Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.

Let me do this digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I take the previous layer, multiply by 3, add 1, and that gives me the next layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. So, Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nI wonder if this is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 1, so working up to Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the outermost expression. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5*3 = 15, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n29524 * 3:\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might make a mistake in the earlier layers, which would throw off the final result. Let me go back and verify each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k = 3, c = 1. Wait, but our initial term is a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, maybe the formula would be a_n = 3^n + (something). Let me check.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe have a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88572.\n\nWait, 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 3*4 +1, 40 is 3*13 +1, etc. So, the general term is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 =4.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p +1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p =1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's the answer. But let me confirm once more by using the formula. Since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*a_9. But a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=3*59049=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147, then 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, that's the same as before.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the recurrence relation formula for such nested expressions.

    "text": " Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 24 * 3 is 72, write down 2, carry over 7. 52 * 3 is 156, plus 7 is 163. Write down 3, carry over 16. 95 * 3 is 285, plus 16 is 301. Write down 1, carry over 30. 29 * 3 is 87, plus 30 is 117. Write down 7, carry over 11. Then the 2*3 is 6, plus 11 is 17. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should do it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3 = 60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now add them all up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. Okay, so 3*29,524=88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, yeah, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my steps, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.
