    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. I can break this down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3). Wait, actually, 29524 is 29000 + 524. So, 29000 * 3 = 87000, and 524 * 3 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a series. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but wait, a_1 was 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my indexing is off. Let me see: Wait, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as before, a_9 = 29524. Now, trying to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier result. So, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without breaking it down into layers, I could recognize the pattern as a geometric series and use the formula directly. But since I already did it step by step, and verified it with the closed-form formula, I feel confident that the answer is correct. So, to recap: The expression is a nested set of 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost, each layer's value is computed step by step, leading up to the 9th layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. After computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and multiply the outermost result by 3. Using a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation confirms the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Let me confirm 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 Let's calculate that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121 So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 Let me do the math: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364 So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 Calculating that: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093 So Layer 6 is 1093.

Wait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me double-check each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a formula that can represent this. Let\u2019s denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence can be done using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_1 - c/(1 - r)) + c/(1 - r). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1) + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, r = 3, c = 1, and a_1 = 4. So, the nth term would be a_n = 3^{n-1}*4 + 1*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1). Simplifying, that's a_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let me compute that for n = 9 (since there are 9 layers). So, a_9 = 4*3^{8} + (3^{8} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^8 first. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Now, a_9 = 4*6561 + (6561 - 1)/2. Let's compute each part: 4*6561: 4*6000=24000, 4*561=2244, so total is 24000 + 2244 = 26244. (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Now, add them together: 26244 + 3280 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer seems to be getting multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me compute the next few layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me think about it. If I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)), it's a recursive structure where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the values. For n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. For n=2, a_2=13. So, 13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B =13. Now, I can solve these two equations: 3A + B =4, 9A + B=13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 => 6A=9 => A= 9/6= 3/2. Then, plugging back into 3A + B=4: 3*(3/2) + B=4 => 9/2 + B=4 => B=4 - 9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So, the general term is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, since our problem has 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1 up to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 first: a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. That's the same result as before, so it seems correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as \\( \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 as per the original expression yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving out another layer, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer, I computed each layer step by step, making sure each multiplication and addition was correct. Each time, I multiplied the current layer by 3 and added 1 to get the next layer. I did this nine times, each time increasing the value significantly. Finally, I multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result. I think I did each step correctly, but let me verify a couple of the layers to be sure. For example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct.

So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = Let's add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 equals 88,572.

So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to layer 9, which gave me 29,524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88,572. I think that's right, but let me verify one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let's pick layer 3: Layer 2 was 13, so layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That's correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, but in my earlier detailed layers, I had Layer 6 as 1,093, which is correct. But when I got to Layer 7, I said 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. That seems correct. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, all the steps seem correct. I think I did it right.

Then, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me break that down: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that seems straightforward. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, so each time, the value is getting larger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, but maybe it's right. Let me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time you go out a layer, you're doing 1 + 3*(something). So, the first layer is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3 times that. So, yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula here that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence would be a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is when we set the nonhomogeneous term (the +1) to zero, giving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the initial layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me check the exponent in the formula. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's 3^{10} which is correct because each layer adds one exponent. So, yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3 times the sum of all previous layers. Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps I can expand the entire expression to see if it's a geometric series. Let me try that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's denote the innermost 1 + 3 as S_1, then the next layer is S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1, and so on up to S_9. Then, the total expression is 3*S_9. As we saw earlier, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*S_9 = 88572. So, that's the same result. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression without using the formula, I would have to compute each layer step by step as I did before, which is time-consuming but doable. However, since we have a formula, it's much more efficient. But just to be thorough, let me try expanding the expression manually again to ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, both methods give the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've considered it from multiple angles now, so I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach led me to the same result.

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but I want to make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is one layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" is the start of a new layer. From the innermost, each time we add a layer, so let's see: Starting from the innermost 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go outward, we add a new layer. Let me count the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there are 9 layers? Wait, no, let me see. Actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Let's see: Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time we have a \"1+3(\" until the ninth one, which is followed by a closing parenthesis. So, in total, there are nine layers, each with 1 + 3*(next layer). So, my initial approach was correct, computing each layer from 1 to 9. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the layers as a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, let's compute each a_i step by step: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence with constant coefficients, we can solve it as follows. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it works. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation. This gives me even more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could compute this using exponentiation directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the method, whether computing step by step, using the recursive formula, or applying the closed-form expression derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the computed value is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. Each step follows logically, and the alternative methods confirm the result. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check each layer's computation to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers seem to compute correctly. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. But wait a second, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern that could simplify the computation. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, I get 88572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a big number, but considering how each layer was tripling the previous one, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and starting from a_1=4, it's a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. But the formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation seems to have given us the correct answer, so maybe that's the way to go. Another approach could be to recognize that the entire expression is a sum of a geometric series. Let me think about that. If I expand the expression, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to write it out. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). If I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it), the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is just multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Similarly, each 3 is part of the multiplication, but I think this might not be the most straightforward way to approach it. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). But this seems similar to the recursive approach we took earlier. Maybe using the formula we derived is the most efficient way. So, in conclusion, using the recurrence relation, we found that the outermost layer a_9 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me just confirm once more that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the calculations. 3^10 is indeed 59049, as 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 multiplied by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the correct breakdown. Let me do it properly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the value of each layer. \n\nStarting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So far, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121. Let me compute a few more to see if there's a pattern.

Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a_1. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1=4 a_2=1 +3*4=13 a_3=1 +3*13=40 a_4=1 +3*40=121 a_5=1 +3*121=364 a_6=1 +3*364=1093 a_7=1 +3*1093=3280 a_8=1 +3*3280=9841 a_9=1 +3*9841=29524 So, as we saw earlier. The general formula for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with a_1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. a_2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. a_3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. a_4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. a_5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. a_6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. a_7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. a_8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. a_9: (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but it's easy to see how the formula would be useful for larger numbers of layers. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is a geometric progression. So, the value after n layers would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, n=9, so (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Either way, the answer is the same. I think I've verified it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each subsequent layer's value. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step computation. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, I can just multiply 29524 by 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next digit: (since there are no more digits) carryover 2 becomes 2. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, same result.

Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) How many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count: Starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of (1+3(...)), so that would be nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did before. So, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, I think the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let a_n be the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, and then compute a_9, and then multiply by 3. Let me try that approach. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's find D by plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let me assume a steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Then, D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as before. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think I can confidently say that after both computing step by step and deriving a general formula, the result is consistent. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer and then verifying with a formula helped solidify the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see. Starting from the innermost Layer 1, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is the outermost, which would correspond to n=9.\n\nWait, but let me check: Each time we compute a layer, it's building up the expression from the inside out. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nThus, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as I calculated step by step.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, it's like a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each term is built upon the previous, it's a bit more involved.\n\nBut since I already have a formula and both methods give me the same answer, I'm pretty confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my initial step-by-step computation because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nI was a bit worried about making a mistake in the multiplication, especially with larger numbers, but breaking down each step and verifying with the formula helped solidify that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(previous) +1. So, it's a linear function with a multiplier of 3 and an additive constant of 1. This kind of recurrence relation is known to have solutions that grow exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is tripling the previous value.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by tripling the previous result and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in my earlier calculation, a_1 was 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1))*r^{n-1}. Wait, actually, let me recall the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. For a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n-1}*a_1 + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me verify that. If a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, then the homogeneous solution is A*r^{n}, and the particular solution is B, a constant. Plugging into the equation: B = r*B + c => B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^{n} + c/(1 - r). Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*r^{1} + c/(1 - r) => 4 = A*r + c/(1 - r). Then, solving for A: A = (4 - c/(1 - r))/r. Hmm, this might get a bit messy, but let's try plugging in the numbers. Here, r = 3, c = 1, a_1 = 4. So, B = c/(1 - r) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, the particular solution is -1/2. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. So, general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found earlier. So, using the formula, I can compute this without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But for just nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad, though it's easy to make a calculation error. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I'll just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 3. After computing all layers up to the ninth, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Additionally, derived a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, which confirmed the result. 5. Double-checked the calculations to ensure accuracy. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Interesting, the numbers are growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, that's a jump. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Okay, moving on. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Wow, this is getting big. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72.

So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that checks out.

Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here, but let's continue a few more layers to be sure. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution. To find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the whole thing is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which we just computed as 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Right. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Yes. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time you go out a layer, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. But the general solution is also a_n = A*3^{n} + B. So, setting them equal: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B, so B = -1/2. Hmm, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in the original problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recheck the final multiplication: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 0*3=0. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, all steps check out, and the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me see. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{10} -1 over 2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's multiply each digit starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nThere's no more digits, so we're done.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because when I did it step by step, I thought it might be 88572, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12, so 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, I feel like I might have made a mistake because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure each step is correct.\n\nLet me double-check each layer computation to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct).\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct).\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct).\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct).\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct).\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct).\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 in another way to confirm.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it using another method. Maybe using the standard multiplication algorithm again, but more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's write it out:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check the initial expression again because sometimes when expressions are nested, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see: Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n... and so on until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the outermost expression, which is correct because the original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, each layer corresponds to one more set of parentheses. So, yes, I think my computation is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 another way. Maybe by breaking down 29524:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating each:\n\n3*20000 = 60000.\n\n3*9000 = 27000.\n\n3*500 = 1500.\n\n3*20 = 60.\n\n3*4 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's like a geometric progression where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Hmm, but this isn't a simple geometric series because each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as such.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n \u2265 2.\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B,\n\nwhere A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, but let me check. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation gives the same result, so it seems solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n\n3. Use a recurrence relation to model the layers and find a closed-form expression, which confirmed the result.\n\n4. Multiply the outermost 3 by the result of the outermost layer to get the final answer.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method led me to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\), and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just verify that each step was correct, because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, each step seems correct.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final computation is: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.

Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 in another way: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6 (since 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, no, 29,524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 ones. So, 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 0 (since there's no more digits) but wait, 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88,572.

Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524*3:  \n4*3=12  \n20*3=60  \n500*3=1500  \n9000*3=27000  \n20000*3=60000  \nWait, actually, breaking it down digit by digit:\n\n29524  \n*      3  \n________  \nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7, write down 7.  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8, write down 8.  \nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could notice a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such relations can often be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence would be L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p  \nL_p - 3*L_p = 1  \n-2*L_p = 1  \nL_p = -1/2\n\nHmm, that's a fractional value, which seems a bit odd, but maybe it works. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for all the layers I computed. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression, which is Layer 9, is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that:\n\n3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. I think that's solid.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me verify the calculations once more, especially the multiplication steps, since that's where errors often creep in.\n\nStarting with Layer 9: 29524. Multiply by 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000  \n9000 * 3 = 27000  \n500 * 3 = 1500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard multiplication method:\n\n   29524  \nx      3  \n--------  \n   88572\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.  \n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.  \nSo, 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI guess another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer itself is a similar expression, it's essentially a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula we derived earlier, (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is a direct result of the sum of a geometric series.\n\nIn general, for such a nested expression where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, the value after n layers is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9, so it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 gives us 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. As we saw earlier, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nThis method is more efficient because it avoids computing each layer individually, especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step is manageable, and it helps to verify the result.\n\nI also thought about whether there's a possibility of miscalculating any of the layers, so I cross-checked each layer's value using both the step-by-step method and the formula. They all align, so that gives me more confidence.\n\nAnother thing I considered was whether I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n(1 + 3)  \nThen each layer wraps around that:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3))  \nThen (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))  \nAnd so on, until we have nine layers. So, yes, it's nine layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we correctly substituted n=9 to get Layer 9's value, then multiplied by 3.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles to ensure that my answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression. We can solve this by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\(L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9\\). Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- \\(L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- \\(L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- \\(L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- \\(L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- \\(L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- \\(L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nWe verified each step and used the formula for the sum of a geometric series to confirm the result. The final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so we multiply that result by 3: 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving out another layer, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, we're taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or maybe a formula here, but perhaps for now, I'll just compute each layer step by step since there are only nine layers. Let me proceed: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final computation would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let me break that down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can use another method to compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and see if I get the same result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, more formally, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... up to a_9. Then, the total is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve that recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which would make computing a_9 easier, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, a_9 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I end up with the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we derive a closed-form formula which confirms our step-by-step computation. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's do 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total value is 88572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps? Let me recall. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, actually, no. Wait, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches what I computed earlier. Good. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the general solution, let me verify for n=3: a_3 should be 40. Using the formula: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Similarly, n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, we efficiently compute the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous result plus 1.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer from the innermost. The recurrence is:\n   - a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n   - With a_1 = 4 (since the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4).\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find:\n   - a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\n4. **Compute a_9**: For the outermost layer (n=9):\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Multiply by 3 as per the original expression:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."
