So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 29 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones. Let me break it down differently: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3=1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Let me just check once more to ensure I didn't make any multiplication errors. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 step by step: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88572.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. I can break this down: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. But actually, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute this step by step: 29,524 * 3. I can do this multiplication digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because I might have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88,572. Let me check with another method. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But we're 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476. So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, subtracting, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Maybe adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59,048. Then 59,048 + 29,524. Let's add those:\n\n59,048\n+29,524\n=?\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n0 + 5 = 5.\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1.\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nWait, that gives 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to double-check, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can be even more confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer. By computing each layer step by step, and then applying the final multiplication by 3, we arrive at the result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the two different methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation\u2014both lead to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going to see if it continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait a second, that seems quite large. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised it's so large. Let me check the multiplication again for 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so each layer is a geometric progression perhaps? Let me try to see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, I'll recount the layers: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1, so layers 2 through 9. So, 9 layers in total. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is correct because the exponent is n+1 where n=9. So, 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Thus, a_9 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading up to the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{another term})\\).\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify 3*29524 another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading the digits from bottom up: 7,7,8,5,7,2,8,2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, maybe I did the digit-wise multiplication wrong. Let me try again: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So, starting from the right:\n\n4: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2: 2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9: 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2: 2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, my earlier calculation was correct. So, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the final answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers from innermost to outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L9=29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, then divided by 2 is 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But for nine layers, step-by-step wasn't too bad.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which confirms the result. The final computation yields the answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: I can break this down as 3 * 29000 + 3 * 524. 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.

So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524.

Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it more carefully. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nFinally, the next digit is 0 (since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4), so 2*3=6, but wait, I think I miscounted.

Because if any of the layers before were miscalculated, it would throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 using another method.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, actually, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. So, the first layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier, so that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nExpanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this expansion, after n-1 steps, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_1.\n\nBut since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3, we can see that this is a geometric series.\n\nThe sum of the geometric series up to n terms is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nThus, the value of the expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's value follows a geometric progression. The final result is computed as 3 times the value of the ninth layer, leading to the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, we have: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is of the form Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me try that. Let's assume Ln = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but when n=1, L1=4. Let's plug n=1 into the formula: L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, our expression has 9 layers, so L9 is the innermost layer, but wait, actually, in our earlier breakdown, Layer 1 was the innermost, so Layer 9 would be the outermost. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer is built around it. So, when we computed Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 as 13, up to Layer 9 as 29524, that corresponds to n=1 to n=9. So, using the formula, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's correct, matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. To ensure that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can break down 29524 into 29000 + 524. Then, 3*29000 = 87,000. 3*524 = 1,572. Adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Same result. So, that seems solid. I think I've got the right answer here. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer was 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and then applying the final multiplication by 3, I arrived at the solution of 88,572. I also verified the result using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, which confirmed the answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation, a closed-form formula was derived to confirm the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because that seems a bit off. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

Compute each part:\n\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

So, writing it down: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total is 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524: as above, 29524*3=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this expression in a different way or check if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, both by iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that all adds up. So, I think I did this correctly. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent mistakes. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a couple of layers. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. And Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. I guess the key here was to recognize the pattern and work methodically from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step. It might look intimidating at first, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Wait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count them: The innermost is (1+3), then each next is (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, moving out, each additional (1+3(...)) adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections: Each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer until the last one which ends with a \"))). So, starting from the innermost: (1+3) is layer 1. Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of times we have a (1+3(...)) structure. Each time we have a (1+3(...)), it's a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first (1+3(1+3(...))) is layer 2\n- Each subsequent (1+3(...)) is another layer.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me think again. Each time you have a 1 + 3*(something), that's a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I count the layers, I think I have 9 layers, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 sets of (1 + 3(...)) after the initial 3. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count the number of times I see (1+3(...)) in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the first ( after the initial 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n- The first (1+3(...) is layer 1\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...) is layer 2\n- And so on until the innermost (1+3)\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach ( after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, from the initial 3, the first ( is layer 1, then inside that, another ( is layer 2, and so on until the last (1+3). Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n- After the initial 3, the first ( is layer 1\n- Inside that, the next ( is layer 2\n- Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's see how many times we have (1+3(...)):\n\n- The first (1+3(...) after the initial 3 is layer 1\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...) is layer 2\n- Continuing until the innermost (1+3), which is layer 9\n\nWait, but when I count the number of ( after the initial 3, I see that each (1+3(...) adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3(...) sections, which is 9, including the innermost (1+3). Wait, no, the innermost is just (1+3), which is the first layer, then each subsequent layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times you have a (1+3(...) expression. Let me count the number of (1+3(...) in the original expression:\n\nStarting from the initial 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first (1+3(...) is layer 1, then inside that, another (1+3(...) is layer 2, and so on until the innermost (1+3), which is layer 9. So, there are 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the number is so large, but I don't see any calculation errors in each step. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if they're repeated multiple times. In this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nLet me define the layers as follows:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed before, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + C\n\nWhere A and C are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent with what I got before. So, that's a good check. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, reading from top: 2,7,5,8,8 \u2192 Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it properly:\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By systematically computing each layer, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Let's compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, that's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem from a different angle, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. I know that for such recursions, the solution can often be found using methods for solving linear recursions, such as finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, the homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Next, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's good. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same final value. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the steps I took were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Computed each layer step by step, checking each result as I went. 3. Noticed a pattern and derived a recurrence relation. 4.

So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29,524 times 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Wait, that's different from before. Earlier, I thought it was 88,572, but when I first calculated it, I wrote 88572, which is the same as 88,572. So that's correct. Hmm, maybe I was just confused when I saw the comma, but actually, 88572 is the same as 88,572. So, that seems right. Let me confirm once more. Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem using a different method, maybe recognizing a pattern or a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and solve the recurrence. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3, is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That also checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer is \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. Let's compute that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right, we have 2,7,5,7,7,7,7,7,8. Wait, that would be 877777572? That can't be right because 29524 * 3 is definitely not 877777572. Wait, no, that must be a mistake because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number, not 9 digits. So, I must have messed up the digit-by-digit approach. Let me try another way. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3. That might be easier. 30000 * 3 = 90000. 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches my earlier result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one correctly. I don't see any miscalculations in the individual layers. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach to verify. Let's think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me recall that for a repeated expression like a + r*b, where a is a constant and r is a multiplier, if it's repeated n times, the sum can be expressed using the formula for a geometric series. But in this case, it's not exactly a sum; it's more like a recursive expression. Let me define each layer as L_k, where k goes from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3  \nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1  \nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2  \n...  \nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8  \nAnd the total expression is 3*L_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for L_k. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => 0 = 1 + 2*L_p => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we computed earlier. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms our earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. I think this solidifies that the answer is indeed 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, L_9 is indeed (59049 -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that it's correct. Alternatively, if I had to compute this without using the closed-form solution, I could have just continued computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), it's feasible. But for more layers, the closed-form solution would be more efficient. However, in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods are doable. I think I've covered all the steps and verified my work sufficiently. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Hmm, let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 is 4, correct. Then each subsequent layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Each step, I multiplied by 3 and added 1, which seems consistent. Let me verify a couple of the layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. For Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 64*3 is 192, total 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, total 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, total 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 41*3 is 123. Total is 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. That seems right. So, I think my calculations are correct, and the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. That seems like a geometric sequence or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can write this recurrence relation as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSubstituting the general solution:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, that's a formula for each layer. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it works.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, using this formula, the 9th layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the entire expression without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify the result using the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using another approach, like expanding it as a geometric series.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to see how many terms there are when expanded. Each time we have a 3 multiplied by a term that includes another 1 + 3(...). So, it's like a nested multiplication.\n\nIf I denote the innermost expression as E, then E =1 +3.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 +3E.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3E) =1 +3 +9E.\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, it's better to stick with the formula we found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of each layer as adding a power of 3, maybe there's a way to sum it up as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try to see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, which is 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be expressed as 1 +3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAs we saw earlier, this recurrence leads to L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as 3 multiplied by a sum that can be expanded into a geometric series, perhaps I can model it that way.\n\nBut given that we've already confirmed the result using two methods\u2014direct computation and the closed-form formula\u2014it's probably safe to conclude that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the inside out, which gave me 88572.\n\n2. Derived a formula using the recurrence relation, which also gave me 88572.\n\n3. Expanding the expression as a geometric series also led to the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). We compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2} & : 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3} & : 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4} & : 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5} & : 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6} & : 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7} & : 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8} & : 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9} & : 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The entire expression is \\(3 \\times\\) (Layer 9):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n4. Verification using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the result.\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, just to confirm. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, expanding it, each layer is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain power. Wait, is that accurate? Let me check. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n\nWait a second, this looks like each layer is the sum of a geometric series where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=n, where n is the layer number. For example:\n\nLayer 1: sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nLayer 3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n: sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is given by S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio. Here, r=3, so S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that with Layer 1: n=1, so S=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. Layer 2: n=2, S=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. Layer 3: n=3, S=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) but wait, no, because each layer is nested, so it's actually a different structure. Wait, no, actually, each layer is built upon the previous one, so it's more accurate to model it as a geometric series with each layer adding a higher power of 3. But I think the approach I took by computing each layer step by step is correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my initial step-by-step computation. Let's go through the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that all looks correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, using the geometric series formula for Layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59,049 -1=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. So, both methods agree. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. The outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's Layer 2. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, finally, we compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up each part multiplied by 3: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check it another way. Let's see, perhaps using a different approach, like recognizing a pattern or formula. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n from 2 to 9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, wait a second. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Good. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. That's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Yep. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Right. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's accurate. Now, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 can be calculated as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you do multiple layers, you might have missed a step. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with multiple layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can represent it as such. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then the next is Layer 2, and so on. How many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...))))) So, there are 9 layers, meaning n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 9 was the innermost? Wait, no, in our initial approach, Layer 1 was the innermost, and Layer 9 was the outermost. So, in the formula, L_n where n=9 would be the outermost layer before the final multiplication. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which matches our previous result. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a good check. So, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because the layers are 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, as we saw earlier. So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. Let me continue computing each layer step by step to see if I can find a pattern or a shortcut. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280.

Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes: 1. Started with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems to follow logically from the previous one, so I think my calculations are correct. However, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can check one of the layers again. Let's pick Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121. So, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, and 363 + 1 is 364. That's correct. How about Layer 7: Layer 6 was 1093. So, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct again. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All right, I feel confident that each step is accurate.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total should be 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some kind of recursive formula. Let me think about it. Each layer n is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048; divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure. 2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, layer by layer. 3. Verify each step to avoid arithmetic errors. 4. Realize that each layer follows a recurrence relation. 5. Solve the recurrence relation to find a general formula. 6. Use the formula to compute the value of the outermost layer. 7. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. This systematic approach helped me avoid mistakes and confirm the correctness of the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. To solve it, we compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer, we find the value of the outermost layer and multiply it by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if that's a geometric progression or something else. Wait, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each term is defined recursively. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty large, but considering each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's exponential growth. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I calculated earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(... nine times ...))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that's nine layers. So, n=9, which gives a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. Yep, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try expanding the expression step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4=3^1 +1. Then, 1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=3^2 +3 +1. Then, 1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 1 +3=4=3^1 +1. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13=3^2 +3 +1. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1. So, each layer is the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +...+3^n, where n is the layer number. Wait, but in our case, the layers go up to 9, but in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, from k=0 to k=n. So, yes, the sum S = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, S=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as before. Therefore, 3*S=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, labeling them for clarity. 3. Notice a pattern leading to a linear recurrence relation. 4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a general formula for each layer. 5. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer. 6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. 7. Verify the calculations using an alternative method (summing the geometric series). 8. Confirm that both methods lead to the same result, ensuring accuracy. I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 2 (from 524) * 3 = 6, plus 7 carried over is 13, write down 3 and carry over 1. 5 (from 9524) * 3 = 15, plus 1 carried over is 16, write down 6 and carry over 1. 9 (from 29524) * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2 (from the ten-thousands place) * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try multiplying 29,524 by 3 another way. 29,524 * 3: Break it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, so that checks out. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.

Let's continue this process. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me denote L(n) as the value at layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such sequences. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is L(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3, and b = 1. But wait, our initial condition is L(1) = 4. Let me check. If n=1, L(1) = 1 + 3*L(0). But we don't have L(0). Hmm, maybe it's better to adjust the formula. Alternatively, since the recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1)=4, we can solve it as follows. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before, so that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, using both the iterative method and the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's solid.

Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, 9 layers, meaning I have layers 1 through 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, my calculation of 9 layers seems correct. Let me try another approach to see if I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence relation is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1)*(r^{n-1}) when r \u2260 1. Wait, let me recall the formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant. So, substituting a particular solution a_p = K, we get K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as I calculated earlier. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that matches my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, subtracting 1 gives 59048, dividing by 2 gives 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572. Yeah, that seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step or using a derived formula, we find the value of the expression to be 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those together: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since each layer depends on the previous one, it's easier to compute each step manually.

So, 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just verify with another method to be absolutely sure. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it again to confirm: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, I think I did it correctly.

Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, I think I did that correctly. Each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a common pattern that can sometimes be expressed using geometric series, but in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step was manageable. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but just to be thorough, let me check a couple of the layers again. Let's check Layer 6: 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3 again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yep, that's correct.

Calculating 3*9841: Let me break this down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's Layer 2. Now Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Well, 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's breaking it down digit by digit. Alternatively, 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, we have a (1+3(...)) inside another. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let's see: 1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n2. Then inside that, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n...\nContinuing this way, each time, we have another layer. Let me count the number of layers by the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: The expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)). The first (1+3(...) is the first layer, then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on, until the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(...)), and inside that, another 3(...), and so on, until there are nine 3s inside? Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me try to parse the expression again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms. Starting from the first one after the initial 3: 1. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n2. Inside that, (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n3. Then (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n4. Then (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n5. Then (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. Then (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n7. Then (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n8. Then (1 + 3)\nWait, so actually, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, wait a minute, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right?
