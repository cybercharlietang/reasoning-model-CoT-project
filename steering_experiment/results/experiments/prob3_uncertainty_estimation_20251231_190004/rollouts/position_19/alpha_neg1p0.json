    "text": " So, maybe I should start by computing Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply the entire thing by 3 at the end? Let me check that. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer seems to be growing by a factor of 3 plus 1 each time. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake with arithmetic. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, +1=29524. Correct.) Now, the outermost operation is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, when I computed up to Layer9, I think I was correct because each Layer corresponds to one level of nesting. So, yes, Layer9 is the innermost part, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. So, the final value is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. If I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) n times, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_k^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's see, when k=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, substituting k=1 into the general solution: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nk=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the expression is indeed 3*(L_9). The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is Layer1, and each subsequent layer wraps around, so Layer9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(L_9), where L_9 is the innermost part. So, 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see.\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers.\n\nBut each time, the innermost part is L_1, and each layer adds another 3*(...). So, as we saw, E = 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nThus, E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step as I did earlier is manageable, though time-consuming.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. The ninth layer, L_9, is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 equals 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 equals 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 equals 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). 3*364 = let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 equals 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). 3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 equals 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). 3*3280: Let me calculate that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 equals 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). 3*9841: Hmm, let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 equals 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

    "text": " So, let's define each layer properly. Let me write down each layer step by step. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me recheck each layer's computation to ensure accuracy. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Hmm, but wait, I'm getting 88572 as the final answer, but I feel like that might be a bit high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). This seems similar to a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 more efficiently without computing each layer individually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. Looking at the values: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Hmm, these numbers seem familiar. Let me see if they relate to powers of 3 or something similar. Let me compute 3^0 = 1, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Hmm, not directly matching, but perhaps there's a relationship. Alternatively, let me see if a_n can be expressed as (3^(n) - 1)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4, so that doesn't fit. Maybe another formula. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, which matches a_4=121. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364, which matches a_5=364. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, which matches a_6=1093. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280, which matches a_7=3280. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841, which matches a_8=9841. For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches a_9=29524. Wow, okay, so the general formula for a_n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. That's a useful pattern! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula to find a_9 directly. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^(9+1) -1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. It's reassuring to see that both methods give me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer was 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form formula for each layer, I could compute the final result more efficiently. This approach saved me from manually computing each of the nine layers, which would have been time-consuming and prone to calculation errors. It's a good reminder that sometimes stepping back and looking for patterns can simplify even the most daunting-looking problems.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

    "text": " So, the innermost Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Wait, is there a pattern here? Let me check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\nFinally, the leftmost digit is 2, which is 2 \u00d7 3 = 6.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 layers deep. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, which I computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric progression with ratio 3, and the closed-form formula is as derived.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n3. **Multiply by 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, the innermost Layer 1 is (1 + 3), then Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), and so on until Layer 9. Hmm, but in the given problem, the innermost Layer 1 is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me write each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Okay, so Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 3*3=9. Wait, actually, I think I may have made a mistake here because 29524 *3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 *3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Finally, the leftmost digit: 3*3=9. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, when I multiply by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. The next digit is the 2 at the start: 2*3=6, but wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as 29524 *3. Let me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, but let me check:\n\n29524 *3:\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 +20*3 +4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\nNow add them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 +1500=88500\n88500 +60=88560\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, so 29524*3=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because this is a lot of computation, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\nThen 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Let me denote the innermost term as a1=1+3=4. Then a2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13, which is 1 +3*4. Similarly, a3=1 +3*a2=1+3*13=40, and so on. So, in general, a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, starting with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K -3K =1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C -1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n=9 is 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. That's a neat shortcut, but since I already computed it step by step, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3=4\n\nThen, 1+3*4=13\n\n1+3*13=40\n\n1+3*40=121\n\n1+3*121=364\n\n1+3*364=1093\n\n1+3*1093=3280\n\n1+3*3280=9841\n\n1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sum where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on, until we have nine layers. Hmm, maybe I should work from the inside out. Let's try that. So, let me start with the innermost part and compute each layer step by step. Let me write this out. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3 times that, right? So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's see, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this result without computing each layer manually.\n\nI remember that expressions like this, where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSubtract 3*a_p from both sides:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I computed manually. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers.\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nBut I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can expand the expression step by step, but that might be time-consuming. However, since I've already used two methods to get the same result, I feel more confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. I computed each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, which took me through Layers 1 to 9, resulting in 29524 for Layer 9.\n\n2. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572.\n\n3. I also solved the recurrence relation to find a general formula for each layer, which gave me a_9 = 29524, confirming my step-by-step computation.\n\n4. Multiplying that by 3 again gave me 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty sure that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading up to the ninth layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay. Layer 4 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 3): 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that's a jump. Let me check that again. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yep, that's correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.

Let's define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3(L1), L3 = 1 + 3(L2), and so on until L9. Then, the entire expression is 3(L9). Let me compute each layer one by one. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to L2: L2 = 1 + 3(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Therefore, L3 = 40. Now, L4 = 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Thus, L4 = 121. Moving on to L5: L5 = 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 = 360, and 1*3 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363.

    "text": " So, if I compute each layer step by step, it might help. Let's try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 4 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1092 +1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279 +1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 +1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 +1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Therefore, the result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, that gives 88,572. Yep, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outward, I arrived at the final result. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I think that's the correct approach because each layer depends on the previous one, so you can't compute them in any other order. If I tried to compute from the outside first, I wouldn't have the necessary values for the inner layers. So, this methodical approach seems solid. I also checked each step as I went, which helped catch any mistakes early on. For example, when I computed 3*9841, I broke it down into parts to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. It's easy to miscompute a large multiplication, so taking it step by step helps prevent that. Overall, this was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and the importance of systematic computation. It also reminded me how crucial it is to carefully keep track of each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of operations. I feel more confident now in tackling similar problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093.

Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original expression is 3 times the entire Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. Each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a common pattern that can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or using recursion. But since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which compounds the growth quickly. If I were to generalize this, for an expression with n layers, the value would be 3^n - 1 divided by 2, but let me check that. Wait, actually, the expression here is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is a bit different. Let me think about the general form. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s say a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify with a different method to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with repetitive and potentially error-prone calculations. So, in conclusion, by computing each nested layer step by step and then multiplying the final result by 3, I find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Because if I made a mistake in one layer, it would propagate through all the subsequent layers, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, total is 9000+840=9840.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding it step by step, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use here, recognizing this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that seems like a jump. Let me check that again. 3*40 is indeed 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Okay, moving on. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. That's Layer 5. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.

    "text": " So, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, Layer 4 = 1 + 3*40. Let's compute 3*40: that's 120. Then, Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). So, Layer 5 = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). So, Layer 6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. Breaking it down: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). So, Layer 8 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9. Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe there's a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe it's simpler to compute it iteratively since there are only nine terms. Alternatively, I can write the recurrence relation as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

But just to be thorough, let me verify one of the larger multiplications again, say 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Let me recompute a few layers to confirm. Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which would be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier result. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers. Let me recompute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when I multiply by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer computation as well because if any layer is wrong, the entire result will be off. Let's go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems like all steps check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. However, if there were more layers, perhaps a recursive formula or a geometric series approach would be better.\n\nWait, let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the earlier results to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors when computing the layers. Each step seems correct, so I think I'm confident in the result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. The expression can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, repeated multiple times. The formula I derived earlier encapsulates this behavior, so it's efficient to use that instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and either computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, I determined that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with the innermost term being 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - Total = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, maybe I can write this as a recursive formula: Let L(n) be the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L(1) = 4, L(2) = 13, L(3) = 40, and so on. Since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), I need to compute up to L(9) and then multiply by 3. Wait, no. Let me check again. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because each layer is inside another 3*(...). So, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that.

So, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. But wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we find its value to be 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with the innermost Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving outward, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 times the result of all those layers. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with such large numbers.

    "text": " So, perhaps I should start by computing Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until I get to the outermost layer, which will then be multiplied by 3. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.

Let me compute that. 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, that's from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 plus the carried 1 is 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 plus 2 is 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right.

So the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me see if that's correct.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nLet me try computing the layers again, but more carefully, perhaps writing each step down.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because I want to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 using another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step because if I had more layers, this method would be too time-consuming. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here.\n\nEach layer n is defined as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for Layer n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C * 3^n\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C * 3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C * 3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2713\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2713\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2713\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2713\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2713\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2713\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2713\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2713\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2713\n\nPerfect! The formula works for all the layers I computed. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} because that's part of the formula for Layer 9.\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computation is consistent both by iterative layer-by-layer calculation and by using the closed-form formula.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) step by step again, but using the formula.\n\nSince each Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression in a different way, maybe expanding the terms, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a different approach, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, if I think of it as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's a finite geometric series, not infinite. So, perhaps I can model it as such.\n\nBut since I've already found the closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient.\n\nIn any case, I've double-checked the layers, used the formula, and confirmed the multiplication. I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).

    "text": " So, the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer by 3 and then adding 1. Let me write this down as a formula. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me compute up to Layer 9. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break this down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving such recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by recognizing it as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))). Each time, it's a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))). Let me try expanding it step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me compute from the innermost parentheses: Starting from the innermost 1+3=4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, as I did before, each layer is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. So, E=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the formula approach gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nWe start by recognizing the nested structure, where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times$ (previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation $L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}$ with $L_1 = 4$. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For the 9th layer, $L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$. Multiplying by 3, the entire expression evaluates to $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Thus, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Thus, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841: Let me break this down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...).

So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Thus, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be growing exponentially. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nFor example, let's compute a_3 using the formula. a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSimilarly, a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct again.\n\nSo, the formula works, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute directly without manually computing each layer. That would have saved time, especially if the expression had more layers.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we find that each layer follows a specific sequence. Applying this, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward, ultimately multiplying by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This can be modeled recursively.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For the innermost layer (n=1), a_1 = 4.\n\n5. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer**: Using the formula, compute each layer up to n=9.\n\n6. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAnswer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let's begin by computing Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me confirm that with the next layers. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, wait a second. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Calculating 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake along the way. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. Each step checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). In this case, k is 3 and c is 1. So, let's apply that formula. Here, a_1 = 4. So, a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying, that's (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Therefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (9/2) * 3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Calculating 9*6561: 6561*9. Let me compute that: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. Adding those together: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, both methods agree, which makes me more confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, each layer's value is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. This kind of sequence can be represented as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3. The formula for the nth term of such a series is a_n = a_1 * r^{n} + (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), but I might be mixing up the exact formula here. Let me check. Actually, for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Which is what I used earlier. So, that's consistent. So, with a_1 = 4, k = 3, c = 1, the formula gives us a_n = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2, which is the same as (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^8 - 1/2 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yep, same result. So, all methods lead to the same Layer 9 value of 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the result of the expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formulaic approach gave me the same result. So, I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 will use Layer 1's result, and so on. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern emerging here. Let me keep going to see if I can find a formula or a shortcut instead of computing each layer individually, which could take a while. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3, let me do that step by step. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify that because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could try to find a general formula for such nested expressions because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, that can be written as L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier to make sure it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked my work, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a general formula helped solidify that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times$ (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by the formula $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. \n\nFor the outermost layer (n=9), we compute $L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving outward, Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1092 +1=1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Wait, just to double-check, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, each layer seems to follow a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula or a pattern that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, L_2 =1 +3*4=13, L_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., as I calculated before. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see: L_1=4=1 +3*1\nL_2=1 +3*4=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13\nL_3=1 +3*13=1 +39=40\nWait, alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Because each time, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, maybe L_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Let me test this. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. But L_1 is 4, so that's not matching. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 +1? Let me check for n=1: (3^{2}-3)/2 +1=(9-3)/2 +1=6/2 +1=3 +1=4. That matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -3)/2 +1=(27-3)/2 +1=24/2 +1=12 +1=13. That matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -3)/2 +1=(81-3)/2 +1=78/2 +1=39 +1=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -3)/2 +1=(243-3)/2 +1=240/2 +1=120 +1=121. Correct. So, it seems that L_n = (3^{n+1} -3)/2 +1. Let me simplify that: (3^{n+1} -3 + 2)/2=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. That works for n=1,2,3,4. So, in general, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, since there are nine layers, the outermost layer is L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got when I computed Layer 9 manually. So, that formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572, which matches my previous calculation. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost layer and working outward, which is what I did initially. But using the formula helps me avoid doing each step manually, which is helpful, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step was manageable. Let me just recap: Each layer is defined as L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, L_2=13, L_3=40, L_4=121, L_5=364, L_6=1093, L_7=3280, L_8=9841, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the formula I derived seems to fit perfectly with the computed values. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, the final computation is: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 29,000 is 87,000, and 3 * 524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer adds another 3, but it's nested, so maybe it's a geometric progression with ratio 3. Wait, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to the next term. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))...)). So, if I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to see how many terms there are. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(...), so if I expand it all the way, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))) with nine layers. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))) with nine 1's. Let me count the number of 1's: Each time you go a layer deeper, you add another 1. Since there are nine layers, I think there are nine 1's. So, the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))) with nine 1's. So, when expanded, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))). So, the total number of terms when fully expanded would be a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to express it as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))) with nine layers. Let me expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 =4, as before. Then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, as I did before, each layer n is 1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is 29524, as found earlier. So, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that. Let me consider the expression S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))). Let me denote the innermost part as 1 +3, which is 4. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, the innermost part is 1 +3, and each layer wraps around that. So, when I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to write this as a sum. Each time, the 3 is multiplied by the inner expression, which itself is 1 +3*something. So, expanding all the way, it would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... +3^9*1 + 3^10*1? Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me see: If I expand S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))) with nine layers, then S = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))). But actually, each time, it's 3*(1 +3*(...)), so it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but the innermost term is 1 +3, so perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, and then adding 3^10. Let me test this idea. If I have S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))) with nine layers, then expanding it, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... +3*3*...*3*1, with nine 3's. So, that's the sum from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k. Wait, but that sum would be 3 + 9 + 27 + ... +3^9. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n+1} - r)/ (r -1). So, sum = (3^{10} -3)/ (3 -1) = (59049 -3)/2 =59046/2=29523. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum) =3*29523=88569. Wait, but that's different from the 88,572 I got earlier. Hmm, that's a problem. Where did I go wrong? Let me check. Wait, perhaps my model is incorrect. Let me think again. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(...)), so when I expand it, it's 3*1 +3*3*(1 +3*(...)), but the inner part is itself 3*(1 +3*(...)), so maybe it's more accurate to model it as S =3*(1 + S'), where S' is the next layer. But this seems recursive, which might not be the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps the expression S =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... +3))) with nine layers can be written as S =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... +3))) where the innermost part is 1 +3. So, the expansion would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step: Starting from the innermost: 1 +3=4. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, this matches my initial step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. The mistake earlier was trying to model it as a simple geometric series, but the structure is such that each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer), which doesn't exactly fit a geometric series. Instead, it's a linear recurrence, which I solved earlier using the closed-form formula, which gave me a_9=29524, leading to the final answer of 88,572. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. To be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60,000; 9000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding these together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let me define each layer properly. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where each Lk is the expression at the k-th layer.

Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(L1), which is L2, and this continues until the outermost layer, which is 3*(L9). So, I can compute each Lk step by step, starting from L1 and moving outward. Let me compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with L1:\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 is equal to 88572. Because 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing L9. Let me go back step by step to make sure each layer is correct.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, L9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again to be sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar? Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for Lk.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me write the recurrence: Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy Lk = 3*Lk-1, which has the solution Lk = C*3^k, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Lk = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when k=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for k=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=3:\n\n(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the general formula is Lk = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so k=9.\n\nThus, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Lk = (3^{k+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{k+1}-1)/2, where k=9.\n\nSo, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that confirms it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're essentially multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to building a number in base 3, but with a twist. Each layer is 1 more than three times the previous. But regardless, the step-by-step approach seems to have worked well.\n\nJust to explore another angle, maybe using exponents. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have 9 layers, maybe the total expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nExpanding this, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but actually, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nAnd so on, as before. But if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(L9), where L9 is as computed.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each Lk = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, then L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_k \\) where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer} \\).\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\n- \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Now, Layer 3 wraps around Layer 2: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So, Layer 3 is 40. Let's continue this process. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, wait a minute, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, the final step is: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer built upon that. After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result of 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

    "text": " So, perhaps the structure is like this: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, until Layer 1 is 1 + 3. So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so forth, I can build up the solution step by step. Let's try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1572 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572.

Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer's computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so total 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524. Let's compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate a step. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute an extra one. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections. Each time you see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's parse it:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, wrapping around that is 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then, 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n... and so on until the outermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" starting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving outward, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let's count:\n\n- The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3)\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4)\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5)\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6)\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7)\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n- Finally, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers seems correct. Therefore, the result is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, maybe using a different approach or verifying the multiplication steps.\n\nLet me try computing each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, I think I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\nL_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is:\n\nIf L_1 = a*L_0 + b, then the general solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nBut in our case, L_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices. Let me consider n starting at 1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n=> 9/2 = 3C\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for all the layers I computed earlier. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. It's reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...), which can be represented as 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nAs I saw earlier, each layer is a term in a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nBut since I already have a formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, I can use that to find L_9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, using L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\n\nWait, but 3*(3 + 1) is 9 + 3 = 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nBut 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express each layer as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, perhaps if I expand each layer, I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me try expanding a few layers to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13. Alternatively, 3^2 + 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(3^2 + 3^1 + 1) = 1 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 1 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 40. So, 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. Each layer is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, where n is the layer number minus 1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but wait, no, because for Layer 1, it's 3^1 + 1, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k, but 3^0 is 1, 3^1 is 3, so sum is 4, which matches Layer 1.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2 is sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which matches.\n\nLayer 3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which matches.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). For r=3, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis approach also confirms the result. It's helpful to see that the layers correspond to the sum of a geometric series, which gives a closed-form solution without having to compute each layer step by step, which is especially useful for larger n.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by appropriate coefficients. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 3^0\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3^1 + 3^0) = 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0) = 1 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0\n\nContinuing this pattern, Layer n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^0\n\nSo, Layer 9 = 3^9 + 3^8 + ... + 3^0\n\nBut wait, in our case, Layer 1 corresponds to 3^1 + 3^0, Layer 2 to 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0, etc., up to Layer 9, which is 3^9 + 3^8 + ... + 3^0.\n\nBut in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nsum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k) = sum_{k=0}^9 3^{k+1} = sum_{k=1}^{10} 3^k = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nBecause sum_{k=1}^{10} 3^k = sum_{k=0}^{10} 3^k - 1 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 - 1 = (3^{11} - 1 - 2)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, this method also confirms that the result is 88,572.\n\nIt's fascinating how different approaches all lead to the same answer. It reinforces the idea that understanding the structure of the problem can lead to more efficient solutions, especially when recognizing patterns like geometric series.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recursively. Each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's a recursive definition where each level depends on the previous one. By breaking it down into these layers, it's easier to manage and compute step by step without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the entire expression at once.\n\nI could also use a table to organize the layers and their computed values:\n\n| Layer | Value      |\n|-------|------------|\n| 1     | 4          |\n| 2     | 13         |\n| 3     | 40         |\n| 4     | 121        |\n| 5     | 364        |\n| 6     | 1093       |\n| 7     | 3280       |\n| 8     | 9841       |\n| 9     | 29524      |\n\nThen, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nThis table helps visualize the growth of each layer and ensures that each step is correct before moving on to the next.\n\nIn summary, by systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, and applying the appropriate formulas, I arrived at the solution of 88,572. It's a good reminder of how breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts can make them much easier to solve.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost one.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, let's define each layer step by step. Let me write each layer's computation separately. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier to see if it matches. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I could find a general formula for each layer, compute the value for the 9th layer, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this pattern, we can model it using a recurrence relation and find a general formula for each layer. \n\nThe innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by adding 1 to three times the previous layer. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we find that each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.

So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n... and so on, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, what's the initial condition? When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression (Layer 9) is 29,524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, so 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I checked each layer step by step, then recognized the pattern as a recurrence relation, solved it using standard techniques, and confirmed that the formula gives the same results as my step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step calculations. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer and compute its value. I'll start with the innermost one. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Then, Layer 2 wraps around that. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let's do that: 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me recalculate 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them: 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, total 3279. +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, total 9840. +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute this again. 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524*3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's digit by digit, which might be error-prone. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d73=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d73=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d73=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3\u00d729524=88572. So, the total is 88572. Let me just verify that once more because the number is quite large. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d73 as (30000 - 476) \u00d73=90000 - 1428=88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. I think I did everything right. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by Layer 9:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, maybe I should compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on until I reach the outermost layer. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern forming here. Let's keep going to see if there's a recurring relationship or if each layer just builds upon the previous one. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.
