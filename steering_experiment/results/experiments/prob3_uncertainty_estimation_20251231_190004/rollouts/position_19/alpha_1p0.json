    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving outward to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Wait a minute, let me check that again. 3*40 is indeed 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Correct. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because this seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. Each step built upon the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in my computations. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result for this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me break that down. 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n_________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the layers again because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 5 again: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. That's correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's do this step by step: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524. Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but when I multiplied 29,524 by 3, I got 88,572, but let me check that with another method to be absolutely sure.\n\nLet me break down 29,524 into parts:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nMultiply each part by 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of parentheses again to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2013 that's the first layer.\n\nBut wait, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing outward, each time adding another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...). I think there are 9 layers because each time you have a 3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count the number of times 3( appears in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see \"3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, no, the outermost is just 3(, and then each inner has another 3(. So, starting from the outermost, the first 3( is layer 1, then inside that is another 3(, which is layer 2, and so on until the innermost. So, how many 3( are there?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(\n 1 + 3(\n   1 + 3(\n     1 + 3(\n       1 + 3(\n         1 + 3(\n           1 + 3(\n             1 + 3(\n               1 + 3(\n                 1 + 3\n               )\n             )\n           )\n         )\n       )\n     )\n   )\n )\n)\n\nSo, counting the number of 3(:\n\n1. The first 3( is the outermost.\n2. Then inside that, another 3(.\n3. Then another 3(, and so on until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many 3( are there? Let me count:\n\n1. 3( at the very start.\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(.\n3. Then another 3(.\n4. Then another 3(.\n5. Then another 3(.\n6. Then another 3(.\n7. Then another 3(.\n8. Then another 3(.\n9. Then the innermost 3(.\n\nWait, but the innermost part is 1 + 3, not 3( something. So, maybe the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have a 3( after it. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, but each layer corresponds to a 3(.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of '(':\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so that's 9 opening parentheses. So, each opening parenthesis after the first 3( is a new layer. Therefore, the number of layers is 9. So, my earlier calculation where I went up to Layer 9 is correct, giving me 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write down each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when you're dealing with larger numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n_________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nWait, let me think about it. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a1=4.\n\nSo, a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified this multiple times, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363.

So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280.

Let's break it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, did I count the layers correctly? Let me double-check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis is one layer, and I started from the innermost one. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. 3(1+3(...) 3. 3(1+3(...) 4. 3(1+3(...) 5. 3(1+3(...) 6. 3(1+3(...) 7. 3(1+3(...) 8. 3(1+3(...) 9. 3(1+3(...) So, actually, there are nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, my initial approach was correct, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, up to Layer 9, and then multiplying by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But maybe I should check the multiplication in Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is a large number. Let me compute 9841 * 3 again:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 1 = 3\n- 3 * 4 = 12 (carry over 1)\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 (carry over 2)\n- 3 * 9 = 27 + 2 = 29\n\nSo, writing it down: 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524:\n\nLet me compute that as well:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 (write down 2, carry over 1)\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15 (write down 5, carry over 1)\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 (write down 8, carry over 2)\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the manual computation.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nI wonder if there's a closed-form formula for such a sequence. Let me think about it. The general form is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nLp = 3*Lp + 1\n\nSolving for Lp:\n\nLp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer n is given by (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the formula is correctly applied. The formula gives Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for each layer n. So, for the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then,\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) up to nine layers.\n\nBut since each layer is Ln, then E =3*L9.\n\nGiven that L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then E =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10}) =3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, E=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's consistent with my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the exponents. Let me compute 3^11 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each layer, and the formula approach also gave the same result, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute Layer 1 first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or if I need to compute each layer step by step. Let me compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after computing all nine layers, the outermost part is 3 times Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,524. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 (since 28 is two digits) is 8. So, putting it all together: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7, no carry over.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the entire expression simplifies down to 88,572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each time, I'm multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 3n +1 where n is the previous layer. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3n +1. So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but I think the process is correct. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n=9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula I derived for the layers seems to hold true. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Let me compute that: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 gives 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with large numbers. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication seems correct. So, I think that's the right answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I guess the key here was recognizing the pattern and working from the inside out, computing each layer one by one. That way, I didn't get overwhelmed by the number of parentheses and could handle each part separately. It's interesting how these nested expressions can seem complicated at first but become straightforward once you approach them methodically. I wonder if there's a formula or a quicker way to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were much larger. Maybe there's a pattern or a recursive formula that could be applied here. For example, each layer seems to follow the form of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution, which could save time for larger n. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Still, it's good to know that such patterns exist and that recognizing them can simplify the problem-solving process. In any case, I'm confident that the answer I arrived at is correct after double-checking each step. It's a relief to see that each computation built upon the previous one correctly, leading to the final result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me check the structure again. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a better way to think about it. So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors along the way. Sometimes, when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the conclusion that the value of the given expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer helped me manage the complexity of the nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me check that again.

So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can check a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C. If a_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3 up to the ninth layer.\n\n3. Once the innermost expression is computed, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\n4. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n5. Verify the method with a smaller version of the problem to ensure correctness.\n\n6. Optionally, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to confirm the result.\n\nAll steps led to the same conclusion, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121.

Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. So, I think I did it correctly.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write it down more systematically. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but the original expression has 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, maybe I should clarify how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3(...)), so each time we have another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"1 + 3(\", that's one, then another, and so on. Let's see: Each time, after the initial 3, there's a \"1 + 3(\" so let's count how many times that happens.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, to compute this, I need to compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply by 3.

Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize? Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming, but maybe I can find a formula or a recursive relation.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\nLet L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L(n), which would make computing up to Layer 9 easier, especially if n were larger.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's consider the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's plug the general solution into this.\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, plug B back into the initial condition equation:\n\n4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n is equal to (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so this formula works for the first few layers, so I can trust it.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=5: L(5) = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L(6) = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L(7) = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L(8) = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: As before, 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers computed using the formula match the step-by-step computation, which is reassuring.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus three times the next nested term. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280.

Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9, we need to multiply it by 3. Let me confirm that: The outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 3*29,000 = 87,000, and 3*524 = 1,572. So, adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Therefore, the result should be 88,572. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9. Then, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I denote each Layer n as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplify both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). Let me try to expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 88,572. So, that's the same as before. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and we've already solved it as a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Another way to think about it is that each time you go a layer out, you're effectively adding another power of 3. Let me try to see if I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let's see: Starting from the innermost layer, E1=1+3=4=3^1 +1. E2=1+3*E1=1 +3*(3 +1)=1 +9 +3=13=3^2 +3^1 +1. E3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*(9 +3 +1)=1 +27 +9 +3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1. I see a pattern here. Each E_n = 3^n +3^{n-1} + ... +3^1 +1. So, E_n is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but wait, actually, it's from k=1 to k=n. Because E1=4=3 +1=3^1 +1. E2=13=9 +3 +1=3^2 +3^1 +1. E3=40=27 +9 +3 +1=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1. So, in general, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k -1? Wait, no. Because E1=4=3 +1= sum_{k=0}^1 3^k =1 +3=4. Similarly, E2=13= sum_{k=0}^2 3^k=1 +3 +9=13. E3= sum_{k=0}^3 3^k=1 +3 +9 +27=40. So, E_n = sum_{k=0}^n 3^k. Which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^n r^k = (r^{n+1} -1)/(r -1). Here, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88,572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a sum, each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 can be seen as building up a number in base 3. Wait, let me think about that. If I have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), it's similar to how numbers are represented in base 3, where each digit is multiplied by a power of 3. But in this case, each layer is adding another digit. Let me see. For example, E1=1 +3=4, which is like 1*3^1 +1*3^0=4. E2=1 +3*E1=1 +3*(4)=13, which is 1*3^2 +1*3^1 +1*3^0=9 +3 +1=13. Similarly, E3=1 +3*E2=40=1*3^3 +1*3^2 +1*3^1 +1*3^0=27 +9 +3 +1=40. So, each E_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the pattern holds. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*E9=3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k)=3*((3^{10} -1)/2)= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. I think that's solid. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my calculations. Let me recompute a few layers quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yep, all those steps check out. Alternatively, using the formula for E9: (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. 3*29524=88,572. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3: 40. Continuing this way, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about it. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting with a_1 = 4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear equation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For particular solution, assume it's a constant, say A. Then A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1 + 3(...). Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) nine times.\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). And Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think this method is more efficient and confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. It also shows that the nested expression follows a geometric progression, which can be solved using the formula for the nth term of such a recurrence relation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of a geometric progression, we find that each layer follows the formula (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this for 9 layers and multiplying by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation:** The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution:** Solving the recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for 9 Layers:** For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost layer, which is the ninth layer from the outside. Wait, no, actually, the innermost part is the last one inside. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs.

Let me write down each layer and compute it step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times this Layer 9 expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 +39=40.

So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x, applied multiple times. So, each layer is f applied to the previous layer. So, if I define f(x) = 1 + 3x, then Layer 1 = f(3) = 1 + 3*3 = 10? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4. So, maybe f(x) = 1 + 3x, and each layer is f applied to the previous one.\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is f applied to the previous result, starting from 1. So, Layer 1: f(1) = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then Layer 2: f(4) = 1 + 3*4 =13. Layer 3: f(13)=40, etc. So, each layer is f applied to the previous result, starting from 1.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so that's f(1). Then the next layer is f(4) =1 +3*4=13, and so on, up to Layer 9: f applied 9 times starting from 1. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I can find a general formula for f applied n times.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for f^n(1), where f^n means f applied n times.\n\nLet me compute f^1(1) = f(1) =4\n\nf^2(1)=f(f(1))=f(4)=13\n\nf^3(1)=f(f(f(1)))=f(13)=40\n\nf^4(1)=f(40)=121\n\nf^5(1)=f(121)=364\n\nf^6(1)=f(364)=1093\n\nf^7(1)=f(1093)=3280\n\nf^8(1)=f(3280)=9841\n\nf^9(1)=f(9841)=29524\n\nSo, f^9(1)=29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f^n(x). Let's see, f(x) =1 +3x. This is a linear function, so perhaps we can express f^n(x) as a geometric series.\n\nLet me think: f(x) =1 +3x\n\nf^2(x) =1 +3*(1 +3x) =1 +3 +9x =4 +9x\n\nf^3(x) =1 +3*(4 +9x) =1 +12 +27x =13 +27x\n\nf^4(x) =1 +3*(13 +27x) =1 +39 +81x =40 +81x\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. The constant term seems to be following 4,13,40,121,364,... and the coefficient of x is 3^n.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nf^1(x) =1 +3x: constant term 1, coefficient 3^1=3\n\nf^2(x)=4 +9x: constant term 4, coefficient 3^2=9\n\nf^3(x)=13 +27x: constant term13, coefficient3^3=27\n\nf^4(x)=40 +81x: constant term40, coefficient3^4=81\n\nSo, the constant term after n applications seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 +3*(previous constant term). So, starting from f^0(x)=x, but in our case, we're starting from f^1(1)=4.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, we're starting from x=1, so maybe the constant term after n applications is f^n(1).\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a recurrence relation for the constant term. Let me denote C_n as the constant term after n applications, so C_n =1 +3*C_{n-1}, with C_0=1.\n\nWait, but when n=1, C_1=1 +3*C_0=1 +3*1=4, which matches.\n\nC_2=1 +3*C_1=1 +3*4=13, which matches.\n\nC_3=1 +3*C_2=1 +3*13=40, which matches.\n\nSo, the recurrence is C_n =1 +3*C_{n-1}, with C_0=1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for C_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is C_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC_n =1 +3*C_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B =1 +3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 +3*A*3^{n-1} +3*B =1 +A*3^n +3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n +3B +1\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n +3B +1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB =3B +1\n\nThen, -2B=1 => B= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is C_n = A*3^n -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition C_0=1:\n\nC_0 = A*3^0 -1/2 = A -1/2 =1\n\nSo, A=1 +1/2=3/2\n\nThus, C_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nC_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n applications starting from x=1, the constant term is C_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, C_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, C_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*C_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 +2 =8, write down 8.\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n9 *3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\nBut wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. So, yes, 29524 *3 is indeed 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall how to solve such recursions.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + d, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and d is a particular solution. Let's find d. If we assume a steady-state solution where a_n = d for all n, then substituting into the recurrence gives d = 1 + 3*d. Solving for d: d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our initial conditions are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the most straightforward here. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the recurrence relation as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2, as before. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to Layer 1, which is 4. So, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

So, the final computation would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000. 9000 * 3 = 27000. 500 * 3 = 1500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2. 6*3=18 +2=20, write down 0, carry over 2. There's no more digits, so write down 2. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that matches my earlier result. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I was computing Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Let me verify that step as well. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). Starting from Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is Layer n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me check for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But Layer 1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm thinking of a different recurrence. Alternatively, perhaps it's Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1. That's the same as what's happening here. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. The general formula for a_n is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let's test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. So, that doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial term. Let me re-examine. The first term, Layer 1, is 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*40 = 121. Let me see if there's a pattern here. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, yes, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The standard solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, that seems to confirm the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, I think that's correct. But let me check using another method. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step and see if the numbers add up. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me try to model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as Layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, but in the problem, the innermost Layer 1 is 1 + 3, but then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. But wait, in the problem, the innermost Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, so that's correct. So, the sequence is L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * C + d, where d is the particular solution. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, a = 3, b = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since b is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the total expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formulas confirm the calculations. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and substitute it into the next layer until we reach the outermost layer. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break that down: 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Let me add them up step by step: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Hmm, but wait, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation easier without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me try to model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can write this as equation (1): 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find another condition. For n=2, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution, L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 9A + B = 13. This is equation (2): 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify this: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works for all the layers. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since the original problem has 9 layers, L_9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524. As I computed earlier, that's 88,572. But let me verify this multiplication again just to be sure.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60,000\n3*9000 = 27,000\n3*500 = 1,500\n3*24 = 72\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me see if I can represent the entire original expression using the formula I derived. The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} to check: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} is 177,147. Then, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. So, that matches my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because when I was computing each layer, I ended up with L_9 = 29,524, and then 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods agree, which is reassuring. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to expand the expression step by step to see if I can represent it as such. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n... and so on until Layer 9.\n\nBut perhaps if I consider the entire expression as a sum of terms where each term is 3 raised to a certain power, I can find a closed-form solution. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we've already found that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. So, that's another way to write it, and computing that gives us 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, the 1 is being multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power. Let me try to express this as a sum.\n\nIf I expand the expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nExpanding each layer, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me try to represent this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time you have a 1 inside, it's multiplied by 3^k where k is the number of layers above it. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8 because there are 8 layers above it. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Wait, let me think about that again.\n\nActually, each time you go one layer out, the exponent decreases by 1. So, starting from the innermost 1, which is at Layer 1, it's multiplied by 3^8 because there are 8 layers above it. Then the next 1 is at Layer 2, multiplied by 3^7, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost, multiplied by 3^0 = 1. So, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. Because each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power of the number of layers above it, which goes from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. The innermost 1 is in Layer 1, and it's multiplied by 3^8 because there are 8 layers above it. The next 1 is in Layer 2, multiplied by 3^7, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost, multiplied by 3^0. So, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. That's a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, and common ratio 3. The sum of such a series is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), and so on. So, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9, which we found to be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88,572. Alternatively, if I consider the sum inside the outermost parentheses as the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, that sum is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, as I computed earlier. Then, 3*(9841) = 29,523, which is different from Layer 9. Wait, that's confusing. So, perhaps my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the layers. Let me clarify. The expression inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), etc., down to Layer 1, which is 1 + 3. So, when I expand Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). So, the innermost term is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, if I express Layer 9 in terms of the sum, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))). So, that's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). So, the number of terms in the sum inside Layer 9 is 9 terms, each being 1 multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power.\n\nWait, let me try to represent Layer 9 as a sum. Each time you have a 1 inside, it's being multiplied by 3 raised to the power of the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is in Layer 1, multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it), then the next 1 is in Layer 2, multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the 1 in Layer 9, which is multiplied by 3^0. So, Layer 9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k. That sum is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier, using the recurrence relation, I found Layer 9 to be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. That's a discrepancy. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the number of terms. Let me check. If Layer 9 is the outermost, then the innermost Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which is 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524, as I computed earlier. So, that's correct. But when I tried to represent Layer 9 as a sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, I got 9841, which is Layer 8. So, that must be where I went wrong. So, perhaps Layer 9 is not the sum from k=0 to 8, but something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the sum approach is not directly applicable here because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a different structure than a simple geometric series. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3, but starting from a different point.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the entire original expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88,572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula I derived, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the original expression as a sum where each term is 3^{n} for n from 0 to 9, but that might not be accurate. Wait, let me try expanding the original expression step by step:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent each Layer n as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, I got 9841, which is Layer 8. So, perhaps I was confusing the layers with the sum. So, to avoid confusion, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach, which gives me the correct result.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to recognize that each Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nLet me try to compute 3^{11} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is 177,147. Then, 177,147 minus 3 is 177,144. Divided by 2, that's 88,572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times, and each method leads me to the same answer: 88,572. So, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nEach layer \\(L_n\\) can be represented by the recurrence relation:\n\\[ L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1 \\]\nwith \\(L_1 = 4\\).\n\nThe general solution for this recurrence relation is:\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\):\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = ?\n\nOkay, Layer 1 is the innermost, so let's compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Then, moving outward to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula holds for all layers. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, as computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches the step-by-step computation. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Compute each subsequent layer using the formula: 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524.\n4.

Hmm, let me break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.

I started by identifying the innermost expression, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3 times the previous layer's result. I computed each layer one by one, moving outward, until I reached Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute this without using the formula, just by expanding each layer step by step, as I did earlier. But since I already got the same result both ways, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding all the layers, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand it fully, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but wait, actually, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the number of terms is 9, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, when you have a nested expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), it's equivalent to a sum of 3^k for k from 0 to n, where n is the number of layers minus 1. But in this case, we have 9 layers, so n=8. So, the sum would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{9} -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's the value of the innermost 8 layers. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I have 9 layers, starting from the innermost, each time I go out a layer, I add 1 and multiply by 3. So, the total expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, no, because each time you add 1 and multiply by 3, it's more like a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach. Since each layer a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4, as I did earlier, and the formula gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponents. Let's see, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Let me think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to recognize that each time you go out a layer, you're effectively adding another power of 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 1.\n\nWait, 3^2 is 9, plus 3^1 is 3, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1.\n\nYes, 27 + 9 + 3 +1 = 40.\n\nSo, each layer adds another power of 3. Therefore, after 9 layers, the expression inside would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. That's a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, ratio 3. The sum S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result. Wait, no, because in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is 3 times the sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, which is 3*(9841) = 29523. But earlier, I computed it as 88572. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does 1 + 3 appear? Let's count the opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each layer adds another (1 + 3*...), and I think there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*... before the final 3*. Let me check:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n- Then, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n- And so on, until the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 9 layers inside.\n\nSo, if each layer adds a power of 3, then the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 3^1 + 1.\n\nThen, next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1.\n\nContinuing this way, after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be 1 + 3*... 8 times, which would be 3^8 + 3^7 + ... + 3^1 + 1. So, the sum inside is S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but earlier, when I computed each layer step by step, I got 88572 as the final result. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm counting the layers. Let me recount. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, so according to this, the sum inside is 29524, which is 1 + 3*(sum of 8 layers). But according to the geometric series approach, I thought the sum inside would be 9841, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. But clearly, that's not matching with the step-by-step computation. So, where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in the geometric series approach. Because in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which isn't the same as adding 3^k each time. It's more like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the sum isn't simply the sum of 3^k from k=0 to n, but rather, it's a different kind of series.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I found earlier. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the step-by-step computation and the recurrence solution both give 88572, whereas the geometric series approach gave me 29523, which is different. Therefore, my mistake was in assuming that the sum inside was 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, but that's not the case. Instead, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous sum, leading to a different result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponents more directly. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as per the recurrence solution, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering both step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost one, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct.

So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 I wonder if each layer is following a certain sequence. Let's compute a few more layers to see. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Hmm, let's see if there's a pattern here. The numbers are 4, 13, 40, 121, 364... I notice that each term seems to be approximately three times the previous term, but not exactly. Let me check: 4 * 3 = 12, but Layer 2 is 13. So, it's 3 times plus 1. Similarly, 13 * 3 = 39, and Layer 3 is 40, which is 39 + 1. So, the pattern seems to be that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me test that: Layer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364, correct. Okay, so this seems to be a consistent pattern. So, each Layer n is equal to 3*(Layer n-1) + 1. That's helpful because it means I can compute each layer based on the previous one without having to compute the entire expression each time. So, if I can express this recursively, maybe I can find a formula for Layer n. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 as per the original problem. Let me try to compute up to Layer 9. So far, I have up to Layer 5: Layer 5: 364. Let's continue:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\nCompute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nLet me break it down for easier calculation:\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524*3 can be computed as (30000 - 476)*3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Wait, actually, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a pattern defined by the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break that down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but that's actually 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 29524*3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula or recognizing a pattern, since each layer is similar. Let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as we computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we determine the value of the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's do it step by step.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit high.

So, the outermost layer is 3 times 29524, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check each layer again just to be sure. Let me recalculate each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems to be correctly calculated. Therefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought it might be a geometric series or something where I could use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient (here, 3) and c is the constant term (here, 1).\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + (c*r)/(r - 1)\n\nWait, let me recall the correct formula. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, let's define the recurrence properly. Let me set a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nThe general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed nine. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3(...\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, each 3( starts a new layer, so let's count how many times 3( occurs.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are nine 3(, which means nine layers. Therefore, a_9 is the innermost expression, and the outermost is 3*a_9. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3, the entire expression would be 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2. But in our case, n=9, so it's 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times using different methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation formula, and even a general formula for the entire expression. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Using the recurrence relation method, each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). After calculating each layer up to the ninth, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Well, 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so total is 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's verify that multiplication again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, I think my final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this result without computing each layer manually. Let's think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. The entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid now. I used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Calculating that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. Therefore, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. Each step seems correct, so I think my answer is right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet's see, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3*C = 1\n-2*C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for all the layers. So, using this formula, I can compute L_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad.\n\nNow, the final result is 3*L_9. Using the value we found for L_9, which is 29524, multiplying by 3 gives:\n\n3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, I can compute 3*29524 in another way. Let's break down 29524 into 29000 + 524.\n\n3*29000 = 87000\n3*524 = 1572\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work. It's always good to verify, especially when dealing with such a lengthy expression. I remember sometimes in the past, I would make a small arithmetic mistake and end up with the wrong answer, so being meticulous here helps prevent that.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is whether there's a geometric series involved here, given the repeated multiplication by 3. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so it's more complex.\n\nWait, actually, when I computed L_n using the recurrence relation, I found that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me try expanding it.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E. Then, working outward, each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, starting from E = 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*E, and so on.\n\nBut since I already have a formula for L_n, which gives me each layer, and I verified it with both step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I think it's solid.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively adding another power of 3. So, the entire expression, when expanded, would be a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by coefficients, but since each term is nested, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, actually, if I think about it, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I let the entire expression be S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) where the part inside the first parentheses is similar to S but without the initial 3. Hmm, maybe that's a way to set up an equation.\n\nLet me try that. Let S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nBut the inner part, let's say T = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to S without the initial 3. Wait, actually, T is equal to S/3. Because S = 3*T.\n\nBut T itself is 1 + 3*(another similar term). Let me see:\n\nT = 1 + 3*(another term)\nBut that another term is similar to T, right? So, T = 1 + 3*T'\n\nBut T' is another similar term, so T' = 1 + 3*T''\n\nWait, this seems like it would go on infinitely, but in our case, it's finite with nine layers. So, maybe this approach isn't as straightforward because it's a finite nested expression rather than an infinite one.\n\nBut if I try to model it as an infinite series, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula. However, since the expression is finite, the recurrence relation approach seems more appropriate.\n\nIn any case, since I've already computed the value step by step and verified it with the recurrence relation, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n3. Verify each computation to avoid arithmetic errors.\n4. Derive a general formula using recurrence relations to compute the layers more efficiently.\n5. Use the formula to compute Layer 9 directly.\n6. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n7. Double-check the multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis systematic approach helped me tackle the problem without getting overwhelmed by the number of layers. It also made me realize the power of recurrence relations in solving nested or iterative problems. I wonder if there's a combinatorial interpretation or another mathematical concept that could explain this pattern, but for now, the step-by-step computation suffices.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. The answer seems correct, and I've verified it multiple times. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me calculate 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me see if this continues.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of layers:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3. Let's call that layer 1.\n\n2. Then, the next layer is 1+3(layer1). That's layer 2.\n\n3. Then, layer3: 1+3(layer2).\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me see: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the expression ends with nine such layers before the final closing parenthesis. Wait, actually, the expression is 3 times (1+3(...)), and inside, there are eight more layers? Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the expression more carefully. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first innermost layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2).\n\nAnd so on, until layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had layer9 as 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I have nine layers or eight layers. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n- The first is after the initial 3: 3(1+3(...))\n- Then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on.\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are eight more \"1+3(\" before the final closing parenthesis. Wait, no, let me count.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, from layer1 to layer9, there are nine layers, each adding a new 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, my initial computation of nine layers is correct, with layer9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have made an error in one of them.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer's computation follows correctly from the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. The base case is L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the closed-form formula works. Therefore, layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods agree. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed recursively. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step: 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right?

Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364.

So Layer 1 equals 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 equals 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3 times Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3 times Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3 times that. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, what's 29524 times 3? Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So that gives me 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then the final result is 3 times the outermost layer. So, each step builds on the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let me just go through each step again quickly to make sure I didn't make a calculation error anywhere.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me start with the innermost parentheses first. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a better way to approach it. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, maybe I can just multiply 29524 by 3 directly.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo, yes, 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere, because that seems like a big number, and I want to be accurate.\n\nLet me go through each layer again quickly to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or look for a pattern to find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThat works. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the innermost layer, but wait, actually, let me clarify: the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4, then Layer 2 is a_2=13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer adds a power of 3 multiplied by 1, but I think the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward here.\n\nWait, let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. Let's consider that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so each layer is like 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, perhaps it's a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(Layer2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1 +3*40=121\n\nWait, but looking at these numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,...\n\nI notice that 4= (3^2 +1)/1? Wait, 3^2=9, 9+1=10, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, 4=3 +1, 13=3*4 +1, 40=3*13 +1, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each term can be expressed as (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check:\n\nFor n=2: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which is Layer1.\n\nn=3: (27 -1)/2=13, which is Layer2.\n\nn=4: (81 -1)/2=40, which is Layer3.\n\nn=5: (243 -1)/2=121, which is Layer4.\n\nYes, so in general, Layer k is (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as before.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFor example, Layer5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for each layer.\n\nTherefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a closed-form formula.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364. Let me compute that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092.

So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.

Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let's see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of all those layers. So, let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, but that's breaking it down into each digit place. Alternatively, I can compute it as 3*29524. Let me compute it directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that because when I broke it down earlier, I thought 3*29524 would be 88572, but let me double-check the multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly to confirm. Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, it seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say a1 = 1 + 3. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on until a9. Then the entire expression is 3*a9. So, if I compute each a1 through a9, I can find the value. That seems manageable. Let me write down each a_i:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the a_i values again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the sequence.\n\na1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a9 is indeed 29524. Then 3*a9 is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the entire expression 3*(a9) where a9 is the innermost 1 + 3, or is it 3*(a9) where a9 is the outermost expression? Let me make sure I'm not confusing the layers.\n\nWait, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times something, which is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is the first 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, my approach was correct: a1 is innermost, a9 is the outermost, and the entire expression is 3*a9. So, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each a_i is following a recurrence relation: a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i, which might help verify the result.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nSo, when i = 1: a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values:\n\nFor i = 1: a1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\ni=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\ni=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\ni=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\ni=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\ni=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\ni=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\ni=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\ni=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for all a_i up to i=9.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but 3^{10} is 59049, right? Yes, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYep, same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is to recognize that it's a geometric series. Each a_i can be seen as a term in a geometric progression, which is why we were able to find a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually was feasible, though a bit time-consuming. It's good to see that both methods\u2014iterative computation and finding a closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same result, which adds to the confidence in the answer.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything seems consistent. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(a_i\\) represent each layer, starting from the innermost:\n   - \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Each subsequent layer: \\(a_{i} = 1 + 3 \\times a_{i-1}\\)\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - \\(a_1 = 4\\)\n   - \\(a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - \\(a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.

So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524.

Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, so the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9, which is 29524. But the problem says to compute 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88572\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. Earlier, I thought it was 88572, but when I broke it down, I thought it was 88572 as well. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 87,572? Wait, no, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nUnits place: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds place: 5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nTen-thousands place: 9*3=27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\nHundred-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572? Wait, no, wait, 29,524 is 29 thousand, 524.\n\nWait, 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000*3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524*3=88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I got 87,572, but that must have been a mistake. The correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm once more: 29,524 *3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87,572? Wait, that can't be because when I broke it down, it was 88,572. There must be a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572? Wait, but when I broke it into parts, it was 88,572. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524 \u00d73:\n\nCompute 29,524 \u00d73:\n\nFirst, 20,000 \u00d73=60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d73=27,000\n\n500 \u00d73=1,500\n\n20 \u00d73=60\n\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the digit-by-digit method must have been misaligned. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I got 87,572, but that must have been a mistake. So, the correct total is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make an error in the multiplication.\n\nLet me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 +3=4\n\n2. 1 +3*4=13\n\n3. 1 +3*13=40\n\n4. 1 +3*40=121\n\n5. 1 +3*121=364\n\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive formula, and it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K =1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1=1+3=4.\n\nSo, L_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is L_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and even found a pattern using a recurrence relation to confirm the result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with nested expressions that can get quite large quickly.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Started by computing each layer from the inside out.\n2. Confirmed each layer's value step by step.\n3. Noticed a pattern and derived a closed-form solution using recurrence relations.\n4. Verified the formula against the computed layers.\n5. Applied the formula to find the outermost layer.\n6. Multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n7. Double-checked the multiplication to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nThis thorough approach helps minimize mistakes and ensures that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula to the ninth layer gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me think. Let's try computing the innermost parentheses first. So, starting with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Wait, that's interesting. Let me check if I'm doing this right. Each time, I take the previous layer, multiply by 3, add 1. So, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121. Let me keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 times the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the total expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers. Let's verify Layer 1 through Layer 9 again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 *3 again. 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding those: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something like that. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =4. So, a_1 =4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2 =9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think I'm confident with this result now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let's calculate 3*13: that's 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's do Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Wait a second, this seems to be following a pattern. Let me check if I'm correct so far. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121. Hmm, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me confirm: 3*4 =12 +1=13; 3*13=39 +1=40; 3*40=120 +1=121. Yeah, that's correct. Now, moving on to Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct, but it's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me verify a few steps: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me confirm that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next. After computing all nine layers, the final result is multiplied by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
