Let's define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 9 first, then multiply by 3. Hmm, that sounds manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nLet me do the multiplication step by step:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm.\n\n29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3 is 88,572.

Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

So, the answer should be 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a general formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nI can see that each term is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p =1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works! So, instead of computing each layer manually, I could have used this formula. Therefore, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I'm confident with this answer now. So, the step-by-step process is to recognize the recursive pattern, compute each layer starting from the inside, or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation to find the value more efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the recursive pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a bigger jump. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, so each time, we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. I can see a pattern forming here. Let me compute the next layers: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Okay, so Layer 9 gives me 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, carry over 0. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of steps, but each step makes sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer was correctly computed. Let me check one or two layers again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd finally, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. So, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives me 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 364*3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12.

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me check 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this right. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers, with the final result being multiplied by 3. The step-by-step computation leads to the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, but wait, looking back at the original problem, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, there are nine layers in total, each being 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is growing exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but nested. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think about that for a second. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), it's a recursive structure. In this case, a is 1, and b is 3. So, maybe there's a way to express the entire thing without computing each layer. Let me see. Let's denote S(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. S(2) = 1 + 3*S(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. S(3) = 1 + 3*S(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence can give us a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for S(n) = a + b*S(n-1) is S(n) = (a + b*S(0)), but wait, in our case, the base case is S(1) = 4. Alternatively, the recurrence is S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4. To solve this, we can write out the terms:\n\nS(1) = 4\nS(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nS(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nS(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence is S(n) = (3^n + 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's test it for n=1: (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. But S(1) is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test that for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That works. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the general formula is S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, S(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 result we computed earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since S(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*S(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*S(9) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That makes me confident that 88,572 is the correct result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me calculate 3*13: that's 39. So, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. Well, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. It's interesting because this looks like a geometric series or something similar, but since it's nested, each step depends on the previous one. I think my calculations are correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a couple of layers again to verify. Let's recheck Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've computed this correctly. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but by breaking it down step by step, I managed to get through each layer without making a mistake. I was a bit worried about keeping track of the numbers, especially when they got large, but taking it one step at a time helped. I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have made this easier, like recognizing it as a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which is much faster. I should have thought of that earlier! It would have saved a lot of time instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was doing it manually, step by step was the way to go. Anyway, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we can start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Let me compute Layer 4 to see if I can spot a pattern. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 4, 13, 40, 121... Wait, that seems familiar. Let me check: 4, 13, 40, 121. Each time, the result is 3 times the previous plus 1. Let me verify: 3*4 + 1 = 13? 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Yes. 3*13 + 1 = 40? 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yes. 3*40 + 1 = 121? 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Perfect. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems like a recursive pattern. So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of Layer n, where n starts at 1 for the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, for n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That seems correct.

Let me check these calculations again because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: L1 = 4\n\nLayer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: L6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: L7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: L8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n= ?\n\nCompute 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - (476*3). Compute 476*3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200+210=1410+18=1428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with larger numbers. Let me recompute the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is correct, and Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. Since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nWait, that would be:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSubtract 3*L_p from both sides:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but okay. So, the general solution is L_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n has value L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) starts at 1 for the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let's calculate that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding them together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me calculate that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, now we compute 3*29524. Let's do that: 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence is:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation here. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - b*L_{n-1} = 0. Here, b = 3, so the characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, giving r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (a = 1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1\n-2*L_p = 1\nL_p = -1/2\n\nWait, that can't be right because all our layers are positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps a constant particular solution isn't suitable here because the homogeneous solution already includes a constant term when n=0, but in our case, n starts at 1. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the solution step by step for each layer, as I did before, because the numbers are manageable and the recurrence isn't too deep. Since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nBut for the sake of thoroughness, let's try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be written as:\n\nL_n = C*3^{n} + particular solution.\n\nWe found the homogeneous solution as C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2\n3C = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3\nC = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2\n= (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2\n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the result is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents, let me confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3) is 177,144, divided by 2 is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

    "text": " Let me correct that: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost), and so on. So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = ? Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524\n*       3\n---------\n= 88,572\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, but wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and there are nine sets of parentheses inside. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, in total, there are nine layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) which is 3*29,524=88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we multiply by 3, which gives 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. This kind of nested expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume the particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and applying the formula for the nth term of such a series, we efficiently compute the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.

Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the numbers add up as expected. I don't see any errors in my computations, so I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we evaluate it from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Let me try to compute Layer 1 first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 +72=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, which was 1+3=4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me think. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try to write this out more formally. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original problem, the outermost term is 3*(...), so yes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, if I can compute L1 through L9, then multiply the result by 3, that should give me the answer.\n\nLet me start computing each layer step by step. I'll write down each computation as I go along.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, Layer 2:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot that.\n\nLayer 3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nLayer 4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, this is getting bigger each time.\n\nLayer 5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWhoa, that's a jump. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, that's a big number, but manageable.\n\nLayer 7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, right? Let me check that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Yes, so 3279 + 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nHmm, 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication: 9841*3. Let me compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, that seems right.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is L9.\n\nSo, the final result is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nWait, but that might not be the best way. Alternatively, I can compute 3 * 29524 directly.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, 30000 *3=90000, minus (30000 - 29524)*3=476*3=1428. So, 90000 - 1428=88572. Yes, that matches. So, 88572 is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out.

    "text": " Let me check: The innermost part is indeed 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2. L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let me keep going: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a second, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing L9, which is the innermost part of the outermost layer, we need to multiply that by 3. Wait, no, actually, let me clarify. The outermost layer is 3*(L9). But wait, let's check the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). The innermost is 1 + 3, which is L1. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, because the expression is 3*(L9). Let me make sure. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(previous). So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1+3(...)). Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is L1: 1 + 3. Then L2: 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. Up to L9, which is 1 + 3*L8. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So, yes, after computing L9, we need to multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, let me list out each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given the small number of layers (only 9), computing each step manually is feasible and less error-prone.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, LHS = A*3^{n} + B\n\nRHS = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: L1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (L1) is 4.

    "text": " Let me confirm: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So that's Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me write down each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me calculate that step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15, plus 2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus 1=7, write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the numbers from bottom to top: 7,7,7,5,7,2,4,2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. Write down 8, no carry.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8,7,7,5,7,2,4,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 shouldn't be 8775242. Wait, that must be a mistake in the way I'm writing the digits. Let me try writing it vertically:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\n     8 7 7 5 2\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, not 87752. I must have messed up the alignment. Let me do it properly.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\n     ? ? ? ? ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. That's correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think I counted nine layers because each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and then the outermost 3 times that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that would make Layer 1 as the innermost 1+3, and then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, I think I did it correctly with nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try computing it another way. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find A and B.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can assume that for the homogeneous solution, A*3^n, and for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume B is a constant.\n\nBut let's solve it step by step.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant, a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. So, another way to express the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572.\n\nJust to ensure that I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify the exponentiation:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177,147. Then, subtracting 3 gives 177,144, which divided by 2 is 88,572. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. The key was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form expression using the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find that the expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me check if this pattern continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Okay, so each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, the formula for each layer is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This recursive formula should help me compute each subsequent layer without having to write out all the parentheses each time. Let me confirm this with Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent. Let me try to see if I can find a general formula or if I need to compute each layer manually. Since the expression is only nine layers deep, maybe computing each layer step by step is manageable. Let me proceed.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, once I compute Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, let's compute 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again because 3*29524 should be 88572? Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 29524*3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without having to go through each layer manually, just to confirm.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote Layer n as L(n). So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it.\n\nGiven L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The solution to this is L_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, plug n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I let n=9, then Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to compute it directly.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, and both methods give me the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's compute: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is... hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, we have 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me calculate 3*13 first. 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: Starting from the rightmost digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.

Instead, by handling each layer one after another, I was able to keep track of the numbers better and avoid mistakes.

Let me verify a couple of layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Checking Layer 3: Layer 2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3 times 29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each step seems to add up correctly, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's see: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Therefore, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. But maybe I should compute 3*29524 directly to be sure. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, my final answer is 88572. But wait, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1. Wait, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the formula starts at a different n. Let me try n=2: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_2=4? Wait, no, a_2 was 13. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.\n\nWait, let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: characteristic equation is r = 3*r_prev, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution: since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, as a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, a_4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, a_5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, a_6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, a_7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, a_8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, a_9=29524.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. This confirms the step-by-step calculation I did earlier. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1: 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Plugging in Layer 3: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Substituting Layer 4: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Plugging in Layer 5: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Substituting Layer 6: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Plugging in Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Substituting Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72.

Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nMultiply each digit by 3 starting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each layer was 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and I did this nine times, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Then, I multiplied Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result. Let me just verify a couple of the layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet's check Layer 3: Layer 2 was 13, so Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time worked well. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)): 1. The first is 3(1+3(...)), then inside that is another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) 2. 3(1+3(...)) 3. 3(1+3(...)) 4. 3(1+3(...)) 5. 3(1+3(...)) 6. 3(1+3(...)) 7. 3(1+3(...)) 8. 3(1+3(...)) 9. 3(1+3(...)) Wait, no, actually, each time you have 1+3(...), so the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. 243*243: Let's compute that. 200*200=40,000, but that's not helpful. Let's compute 243*243:\n\nCompute 243*200 = 48,600\n\n243*40 = 9,720\n\n243*3 = 729\n\nAdd them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer step by step, and also used the recurrence relation method to confirm the result. Both approaches gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. So, Layer 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Compute 3*40: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121: Let's compute that. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, wait a second. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Well, that's 120. So, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Okay, moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Hmm, this is getting bigger each time. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Wow, that's a big jump. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since I don't recognize it immediately, I think my step-by-step approach is solid. Let me just verify the final multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it down: 6 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 68,872? Wait, that doesn't match my earlier result. Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me write it properly:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. Wait, no, 88,572 is the same as 88572. I think I just wrote it with a comma as a thousand separator. So, yes, 88,572 is the same as 88572. So, that's correct. So, my initial calculation was right. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought it was 88572, which is the same as 88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's it.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, L3 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me compute the next few layers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula. L4 = 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total is 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Thus, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. I can break this down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: L1 = 4, that's straightforward. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, that's right. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, yes. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, right. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, yes. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: Let's say n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, same as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started by recognizing the nested structure, broke it down into layers, computed each layer step by step, then noticed a pattern and derived a formula using linear recurrence relations, which confirmed the result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So that's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but looking back at the original problem, the outermost part is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192. So, 900 + 192 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3.\n\nLet me break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is written as 3(1 + 3(...)), so the outermost multiplication is by 3, which is what I did. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me cross-verify this because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, especially with repeated operations, there might be a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe I can find a recursive formula or recognize a geometric series or something like that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me write down the recursive relation:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for Layer n, which would make computing the value easier, especially for larger n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is of the form:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n9/2 = 3*C\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3, we have:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^10 = 59049\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this using the closed-form expression as well. Since Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^11 = 177147\n\nThus, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nWhich again, matches the previous result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with large numbers and nested operations where it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the inside out.\n2. Alternatively, model the recursive relation and find a closed-form solution.\n3. Both methods lead to the same result, which is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the closed-form solution for the recursive relation, we determine that the outermost layer is (3^10 - 1)/2, which equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3. So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3 times Layer 4. That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3 times Layer 5. So, 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. That's 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. That's 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9841*3 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the whole nested parentheses, which we just computed as Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let's calculate that. 29524 * 3: Let me break it down. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3. Calculating each part: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 24*3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me verify my calculations because 3*29524 seems a bit high. Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524*3 is indeed 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. So, the final answer is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since the expression repeats itself multiple times. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, starting from the innermost term, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent term adds another layer. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the first few layers to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold for the first few layers. That's reassuring.\n\nSo, using this formula, the 9th layer (Layer 9) is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is then multiplied by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me confirm: The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the last part before the first closing parenthesis. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Then, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me keep computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of layers. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step outward. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so I think I have nine layers to compute. Let me make sure I didn't skip any. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, that seems like nine layers, each adding another set of parentheses. So, my earlier computation up to Layer 9 gives me 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculation again because 29524 * 3 is 88572. But let me verify:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me recompute each layer step by step to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it from the inside again, step by step, to see if each layer is correct.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n, which would make computing the 9th term easier.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\na_n = (c / (1 - r)) + (a_1 * r^{n-1})\n\nWait, but since r > 1, the formula might be different. Let me recall the formula for the sum of a geometric series because this seems related.\n\nActually, the solution to the recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n-1}*a_1 + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nYes, that's correct. So, in this case, r = 3, c = 1, and a_1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, a_n = 3^{n-1}*4 + 1*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n= (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\n= (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that algebra again.\n\nWait, 4*3^{n-1} is equal to (8/2)*3^{n-1} to have a common denominator with the second term. So:\n\na_n = (8*3^{n-1})/2 + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nCombine the numerators:\n\n= (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\n= (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1 to see if it matches a_1=4.\n\na_1 = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (9*3^2 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (9*81 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Wait, no, wait: 3^3 is 27, so a_4 should be (9*27 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Wait, that's correct because 3^3=27, so 9*27=243, 243-1=242, 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, but since I didn't think of it initially, I took the step-by-step approach.\n\nBut now that I have the formula, I can see that the value of the nested expression is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^8 again: 3^8 is 3*3*3*3*3*3*3*3. Let's compute step by step:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561. Correct.\n\nSo, 9*6561=59049. Then, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the ninth layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, let me compute that. 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.

Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I had before. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. So, regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same final answer of 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me compute that carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I compute Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check each layer again because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. As I computed earlier, that's 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, it's another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Each time, it's another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3 around it. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: the expression ends with ...))))))$. So, how many closing parentheses after the last 1+3? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the end: ...3))))))$. So, after the last 1+3, there are 8 closing parentheses. That means there are 8 layers beyond the initial 3. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 appears. Let me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nBut the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but when I counted the closing parentheses, I saw 8 at the end, which would correspond to 8 layers beyond the initial 3. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of 1+3's:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3 appear? Let's see:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3(...), and each time, the ... is another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of times 1 + 3 appears is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of 1 + 3 in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3. So, the number of 1 + 3's is 9, because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, from the first 3, the first 1 + 3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent 1 + 3 is another layer. So, how many 1 + 3's are there? Let's see:\n\n- The first 1 + 3 after the first 3 is Layer 1.\n\n- Then, each time, another 1 + 3 is added. So, in the expression, after the first 3, there are 8 more 1 + 3's because each subsequent layer adds another one. Wait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, it's 9, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3. So, perhaps I have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...), starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought about the number of closing parentheses, I saw 8 at the end, which might suggest 8 layers, but perhaps that's not the case. Maybe the count of closing parentheses corresponds to the number of layers beyond the initial one. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach 1 + 3 is followed by a set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set. So, the number of 1 + 3's is 9, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial computation up to Layer 9 was correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to parse the expression with a different approach. Let me consider that each time I see a 1 + 3(...), it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2.\n\n3. Then, moving out, the next is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is Layer 3.\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which is Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, my computation of each layer up to Layer 9 being 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, step by step, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly a straightforward geometric series because each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me denote L_k as the value of the kth layer, where k=1 is the innermost layer. So:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as computed earlier, L_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_k as:\n\nL_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, for k >= 2\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}\n\nAssume L_k = A*3^k + B.\n\nThen, L_{k-1} = A*3^{k-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^k + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B\n\nSo, LHS = A*3^k + B\n\nRHS = 1 + A*3^k + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^k from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for k=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_k, the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, the expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Wow, okay, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions, but since I already computed each layer step by step, and each step seems correct, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me write down each layer as I compute it:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3.

Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost Layer 1, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. I did that for each layer up to Layer 9, which gave me 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check the layers to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2705\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2705\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2705\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2705\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2705\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2705\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2705\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2705\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2705\n\nAll the layers check out. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me check: The innermost expression is (1 + 3), then moving out, it's 1 + 3*(innermost), then 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on until the ninth layer. So, to make it clearer, I can think of each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nBut actually, looking back at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, perhaps I should compute each Layer from 1 to 9, then multiply the final result by 3. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that:\n\n3*121 = 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364:\n\n3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Thus, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280:\n\n3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Thus, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524: I can break this down as 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72.\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when breaking down numbers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. Let me recount the layers to ensure that I correctly went through each one.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous value). That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1) = 4. Then, we compute up to a(9), and then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. Since each term is defined by a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1), which has the solution a(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCalculating 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've got it right. Each step built upon the previous one, and using the recurrence relation helped me confirm the result without having to compute each layer manually, which would have been time-consuming and prone to error. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to apply a formula and save time.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the recurrence relation.\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation.\n4. Compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nThis method ensures accuracy and efficiency, especially with such a deep nesting of expressions. It's a good reminder of how useful recognizing patterns and applying mathematical concepts can be in simplifying complex-looking problems.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1) = 4. By computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Ultimately, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7. 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8. 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the whole thing. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000.\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000.\nNext, 3*500 = 1500.\nThen, 3*24 = 72.\nNow, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculation because 3*29524 should be correct, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3:\n29524\nx   3\n------\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure that I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, my calculation of Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572, seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each layer's value is correct, and the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x, applied multiple times, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, it's like f(f(f(...f(1)...))) with multiple fs, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nIn other words, if I define f(x) = 1 + 3x, then the innermost expression is f(1) = 4. Then f(f(1)) = f(4) = 13, and so on, up to f^9(1), which is Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*f^9(1).\n\nSo, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for the nth iteration of f(x). Let me explore that.\n\nThe function f(x) = 1 + 3x is a linear function. When we iterate this function, each iteration is f^n(x) = 1 + 3*f^{n-1}(x). This is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nTo solve this recurrence relation, we can look for a pattern or find the closed-form solution.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern.\n\nf^1(x) = 1 + 3x\n\nf^2(x) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x = 4 + 9x\n\nf^3(x) = 1 + 3*(4 + 9x) = 1 + 12 + 27x = 13 + 27x\n\nf^4(x) = 1 + 3*(13 + 27x) = 1 + 39 + 81x = 40 + 81x\n\nf^5(x) = 1 + 3*(40 + 81x) = 1 + 120 + 243x = 121 + 243x\n\nf^6(x) = 1 + 3*(121 + 243x) = 1 + 363 + 729x = 364 + 729x\n\nf^7(x) = 1 + 3*(364 + 729x) = 1 + 1092 + 2187x = 1093 + 2187x\n\nf^8(x) = 1 + 3*(1093 + 2187x) = 1 + 3279 + 6561x = 3280 + 6561x\n\nf^9(x) = 1 + 3*(3280 + 6561x) = 1 + 9840 + 19683x = 9841 + 19683x\n\nWait a minute, so f^n(x) = a_n + b_n * x, where a_n and b_n follow their own recurrence relations.\n\nLooking at the coefficients:\n\nFor a_n: a_1 = 1, a_2 = 4, a_3 = 13, a_4 = 40, a_5 = 121, a_6 = 364, a_7 = 1093, a_8 = 3280, a_9 = 9841.\n\nFor b_n: b_1 = 3, b_2 = 9, b_3 = 27, b_4 = 81, b_5 = 243, b_6 = 729, b_7 = 2187, b_8 = 6561, b_9 = 19683.\n\nI notice that b_n is 3^n. For example, b_1 = 3^1 = 3, b_2 = 3^2 = 9, b_3 = 3^3 = 27, and so on up to b_9 = 3^9 = 19683. So, that's a clear pattern. So, b_n = 3^n.\n\nNow, looking at a_n, let's see if we can find a pattern or a closed-form formula.\n\nWe have:\n\na_1 = 1\n\na_2 = 4\n\na_3 = 13\n\na_4 = 40\n\na_5 = 121\n\na_6 = 364\n\na_7 = 1093\n\na_8 = 3280\n\na_9 = 9841\n\nLet me see if I can find a recurrence relation for a_n.\n\nFrom the function f^n(x) = 1 + 3*f^{n-1}(x), we can write:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nBecause f^n(x) = 1 + 3*f^{n-1}(x) = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + b_{n-1}x) = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + 3*b_{n-1}x = (1 + 3*a_{n-1}) + (3*b_{n-1})x.\n\nSo, the coefficient a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and b_n = 3*b_{n-1}.\n\nWe already know that b_n = 3^n, so that's settled.\n\nNow, for a_n, since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 1:\n\n1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 1 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 => A = (3/2)/3 = 1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is:\n\na_n = (1/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, we can write:\n\na_n = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1. Correct.\n\nn=2: (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=3: (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=4: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=5: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=6: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=7: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=8: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=9: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula a_n = (3^n -1)/2 holds for all these cases.\n\nTherefore, the nth iteration of f(x) is f^n(x) = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n *x.\n\nIn our problem, we start with x=1, so f^n(1) = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n *1 = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n -1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nf^n(1) = (3^n -1)/2 + 3^n*1 = (3^n -1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3^n + 2*3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, f^n(1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so f^9(1) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, f^9(1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*f^9(1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since in this problem n=9, both methods work, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, we can also model this as a geometric series.\n\nLooking back at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression:\n\nLet me try to expand it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nYes, same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the entire expression as a sum of 3's raised to various powers, but given the structure, it's more of a linear recurrence.\n\nBut since we've already solved it using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, and both give the same result, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) directly, step by step, without labeling the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nYes, same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is consistent.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and multiply the final result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula confirms that the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nWe just found that Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nLayer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n3*9000 = 27000\n3*500 = 1500\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number. Let me check if I did each step correctly.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify each multiplication and addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. Total: 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 can be thought of as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can check this using another method. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^{n} + (b/(a - 1)).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + (b*(a^{n} - 1))/(a - 1). But in our case, the first term is L_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to L_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nNo more digits, so write down the carryover 0.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't match the previous step. Let me write it again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nUnits place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nTen-thousands place: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nHundred-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2*3 +2), 7, 7, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did it digit by digit, I thought it was 88572, which matches the earlier calculation. So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step and even used a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues up to Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form solution, we confirm that Layer 9 is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute each digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, my final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Each step built upon the previous one without any errors in calculation, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** Compute the innermost expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:** Substitute Layer 1 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:** Substitute Layer 2 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:** Substitute Layer 3 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:** Substitute Layer 4 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:** Substitute Layer 5 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:** Substitute Layer 6 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:** Substitute Layer 7 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:** Substitute Layer 8 into the next expression.\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
