    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm using another method to avoid mistakes. Alternatively, 3 * 29524 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers before that. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, a_1 was 4, which corresponds to n=1. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 87572. Therefore, the final result is 87572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recompute each layer step by step to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=87572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, and a_{n}=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = C*3^n + D. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, setting this equal to the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtracting 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer manually. That's a good check. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 87,572.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that the initial expression is 3 times Layer9, so that's correct. So, I think my calculations are correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal step: 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a geometric series or a recurrence relation that can be applied here.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back and compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo all layers are correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step without layers, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same result. This gives me even more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. However, because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, it's not a straightforward geometric series, but perhaps it can be represented as such.\n\nWait, maybe if I consider the expression E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), but in this case, the nesting is finite with 9 layers. So, it's a finite nested expression rather than an infinite one.\n\nBut for the sake of exploration, if it were infinite, it would converge to a certain value. Let me compute that as a check.\n\nIf E were infinite, then E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) = 3(1 + E). So, E = 3 + 3E.\n\nSolving for E: E - 3E = 3 => -2E = 3 => E = -3/2. Hmm, that's negative, which doesn't make sense in this context because all our terms are positive. So, maybe the infinite series approach isn't applicable here, or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, actually, if I set E = 1 + 3E, then E = 1 + 3E => E - 3E = 1 => -2E = 1 => E = -1/2, which is also negative. So, that approach doesn't give a positive result, which suggests that the infinite series doesn't converge or isn't applicable here. Therefore, the finite approach is necessary, which we've already done.\n\nSo, going back, the finite approach gives us 88572, which seems correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent every time I compute it. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is recognizing the pattern in the layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a linear recurrence. As we saw earlier, solving the recurrence gives us a formula, which is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1 = 59048 /2 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and using recurrence relations to solve nested expressions. It also reinforced the importance of carefully computing each step to avoid errors, especially with multiple layers of parentheses. I initially thought it might be complicated, but breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts made it much more approachable.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I arrived at the solution of 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct answer after multiple checks and approaches.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 87572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it more carefully. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572, not 87572. I think I missed a digit earlier. Let me write it down properly:\n\n     29524\n   x      3\n   --------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 87572, but now I'm getting 88572. Let me confirm using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 87572, which was wrong. So, the correct final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers earlier.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3.\n\nCompute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdd them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. So, 9841*3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final multiplication is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I might have made a mistake in the layers, but each layer seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of closing parentheses after each 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(.\n\n1: 3(1+3(\n2: 1+3(\n3: 1+3(\n4: 1+3(\n5: 1+3(\n6: 1+3(\n7: 1+3(\n8: 1+3(\n9: 1+3(\nAnd then the innermost is 1+3.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, 9 layers in total, which I computed as Layers 1 through 9. So, my computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So, perhaps the formula is a_n = 3^n + (something). Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, in our case, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n >=1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another a_n until we reach a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Using the formula, each layer n corresponds to a_n, so the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). We compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9), then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So the number is 87572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is actually 88572, right? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier multiplication. Let me correct that. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct). Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 (correct). Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 (correct). Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 (correct). Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct). Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct). Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct). Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct). So, Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3a_9. Let's see if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3(1 + 3a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 a_{n-2}, and so on, until we reach a_1. So, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n a_1. But wait, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps it's better to express it as a sum. But given that we already have a closed-form solution, maybe that's sufficient. Either way, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2, 7, 5, 8, 8, which makes 88572. Wait, that's different from my initial digit-by-digit approach. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm using another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Therefore, the correct result is 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication by misplacing the carry or the digits. It's easy to get confused when carrying over, especially with larger numbers. So, the correct final answer after multiplying 29524 by 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify this with another approach. Let's use the standard multiplication algorithm again, but this time, I'll write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carryover 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 8 (from the last multiplication), then 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I got 88572 as well. So, both methods confirm that 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because sometimes it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake there.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number, so:\n\n9841\nx   3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841 *3 = 29523\n\nThen, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors.\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n10. Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There are no more digits, so write down the 2. So putting it all together: 2 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the layers: Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for just nine layers. Alternatively, noticing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, so earlier when I was multiplying digit by digit, I must have miscounted the positions.

But that's 6 digits, which can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 5 digits. I must be making a mistake in the alignment.

So when I write the result, it should be:\n\nAfter multiplying, the digits would be:\n\nFrom units place: 2\n\nTens place:7\n\nHundreds place:5\n\nThousands place:7\n\nTen thousands place:8\n\nBut wait, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572, which is 88,572, which is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that doesn't match what I got earlier. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the positions. Let me try again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (from the 2 \u00d7 3 + 2), then 7 (from 9 \u00d7 3), then 5 (from 5 \u00d7 3), then 7 (from 2 \u00d7 3), then 2 (from 4 \u00d7 3). So, writing them together: 8,7,5,7,2 \u2192 87572? Wait, that's 87,572, but that's not correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misplacing the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\nWhen multiplying, each digit's result is placed under its position.

Wait, that's 877,572, which is way too big. But when I computed it using the expanded form earlier, I got 88,572, which is correct. So, where is the confusion?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. When I'm writing the digits, I'm not aligning them correctly. The correct way is:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit, the results are:\n\n- Units place: 2\n\n- Tens place: 7\n\n- Hundreds place: 5\n\n- Thousands place: 7\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 8\n\nWait, that's 88,572, which is correct. So, the way to write it is:\n\n88,572\n\nSo, the digits from left to right are 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Therefore, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nSo, to avoid confusion, it's better to compute it as I did earlier by breaking it down into place values:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was trying to compute it digit by digit, I was getting confused because I was misaligning the digits. So, it's better to stick with the expanded form method to avoid confusion.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer step by step. Finally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me verify if I did each layer correctly because that's a lot of steps. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me recall that for such expressions, sometimes you can express them recursively or find a closed-form formula. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier, a_9 = 29524. Now, let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The standard approach for such recursions is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n- 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To find a general formula for a_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. So, yeah, 88572 is the answer.

Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 24 = 59048. Then, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I have a feeling that this might be a geometric series or something, so maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D = 1 + 3D \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me make sure that the number of layers is correctly accounted for. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: starting after the first 3(, the first inner expression is 1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Counting the number of 1+3(...): Let me see: from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...), so the number of layers is 9 because after the first 3(, there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, n=9, which we've used in our formula. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, I think I've double-checked enough to be confident in this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed until the ninth layer, which equals 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested form with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=87572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which resembles a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1=4, as we saw. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1=4. So, when n=1, L_1=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=87572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which can be expressed as a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the sum after n layers would be a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, since each layer is built upon the previous one, it's more of a recursive sequence rather than a sum of a series. But the formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation seems to be the most straightforward way to compute it. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the result is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula, we determine that the value of the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{87572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, so my initial calculation was wrong because I think I added the digits incorrectly. So, the correct final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure each layer was computed correctly because if I messed up any layer, the final answer will be off. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is following the pattern where a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. Let's see if a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4, so that's not matching. Maybe my assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 *3.

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step. Each time, I took the result from the previous layer, multiplied it by 3, added 1, and then used that result for the next layer.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again because that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 87572. Hmm, but let me verify that. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute that step by step. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524; 49524 + 9000 = 58524; 58524 + 500 = 59024; 59024 + 24 = 59048. Then, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 87572, but now I'm getting 88572. I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me do it more carefully: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check the layers again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3(, there are 8 more opening parentheses. So, that would make 9 layers in total. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that each layer is correctly calculated. Let me list each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial problem statement. Let me check again. The problem is: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times '1+3(' appears.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each '1+3(' adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then\n\n2. Next layer: 1+3(1+3),\n\n3. Then 1+3(1+3(1+3)),\n\nand so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nAfter the first 3(, there are 8 opening parentheses. So, total layers would be 9, as I thought before. So, my calculation up to layer 9 as 29524 and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572 seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Let me write down the expression with each layer clearly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define a recursive formula.\n\nLet\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you're dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a multiplication error. Let me verify each a_n step by step.\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. But when I added 29524 three times earlier, I got 88572 as well. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount. Let me count the number of opening parentheses again to make sure.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n1. After 3(, the first ( is for the first 1+3(...)\n\nThen each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3(, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(. So, that would mean 9 layers, which would mean a_9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*(a_9). So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my earlier step-by-step calculation was correct. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, and then multiplying the final result by 3, I arrive at the answer 88572. I think that's the correct solution. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3(4) = 13  \n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3(13) = 40  \n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3(40) = 121  \n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3(121) = 364  \n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3(364) = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There are no more digits, so write down the carry over 2. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost: 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). It seems like there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, I think I did 9 layers correctly. So, my computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, step by step was manageable. I wonder if there's a recursive formula or something. Let me think about that for a moment. Suppose I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b, the solution is a_n = k^n*(a_0) + b*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but in the standard formula, the initial term is a_0, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see. Let me redefine the recurrence with a_0 = 4, so that a_1 = 13, a_2 = 40, etc. Then, using the formula, a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, that would be a_n = 3^n*4 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check if that works for n=1. a_1 = 3^1*4 + (3^1 -1)/2 = 12 + (3 -1)/2 = 12 + 1 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = 3^2*4 + (9 -1)/2 = 36 + 4 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: 81*4 + (27 -1)/2 = 324 + 13 = 337. Wait, but a_3 is 40, which is not 337. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, perhaps my application of the formula is incorrect. Let me double-check the standard solution for such a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*c^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = c*K + d => K - c*K = d => K*(1 - c) = d => K = d/(1 - c). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*c^n + d/(1 - c). Now, applying initial conditions. Let's say a_0 = 4, then for n=0: a_0 = A*c^0 + d/(1 - c) => 4 = A + d/(1 - c). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c=3, d=1. Therefore, K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying a_0 = 4: 4 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = A - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Let me test this for n=0: a_0 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=1: (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is Layer 9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^9 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^9 is 19683. So, a_9 = (9/2)*19683 - 1/2. Let's compute (9/2)*19683 first. 9*19683 = 177147, so (9/2)*19683 = 177147/2 = 88573.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 88573.5 - 0.5 = 88573. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got a_9 = 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But according to this formula, a_9 is 88573.5 - 0.5 = 88573? Wait, that can't be right because when I computed step by step, I got a_9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572, but according to the formula, a_9 is 88573? There's a discrepancy here. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula gives a_n as the value of the nth layer, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, right? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the value of the innermost expression. But according to the formula, a_n is the value of the nth layer, which is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=9, a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8. But according to the formula, a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^9 - 1/2 = (9/2)*19683 - 1/2 = (9*19683)/2 - 1/2. Let's compute 9*19683: 19683*9: 19683*10=196830, minus 19683=177147. So, 177147/2 = 88573.5. Then, subtract 0.5: 88573.5 - 0.5 = 88573. So, a_9 = 88573. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I got a_9 = 29524. There's a conflict here. That means I must have made a mistake in my step-by-step computation. Let me go back and check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the indices. Let me see. The formula gives a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2, but in my step-by-step computation, I started with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. But according to the formula, a_9 should be 88573. So, clearly, there's a mistake in my step-by-step computation. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first inner (1 + 3(...)) is layer 1.\n3. Each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) is another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, but in my step-by-step, I started with a_1 = 4, which is the innermost. So, a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer, and a_9 would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, according to the formula, a_n is the value of the nth layer, starting from a_1 = 4. So, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^9 - 1/2 = 88573. But in my step-by-step, I computed up to a_9 = 29524, which is different. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let's compute a_1 to a_9 using the formula and see where the step-by-step computation went wrong.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\na_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nCompute for n=1 to n=9:\n\nn=1: (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. But in my step-by-step, a_1 was 4. So, that's the issue. Wait, in the formula, a_n is defined as starting from a_0 = 4, but in my step-by-step, I started from a_1 =4. So, perhaps the formula is shifted by one index.\n\nLet me re-examine the formula. Earlier, I set a_0 =4, so a_1 corresponds to n=1 in the formula. But in my step-by-step, I started with a_1 =4, which would correspond to n=0 in the formula. Therefore, to align the indices, in my step-by-step, a_k corresponds to a_{k-1} in the formula.\n\nSo, if in the formula, a_0 =4, then a_1 =13, a_2=40, etc. Therefore, in my step-by-step, a_1 =4 corresponds to a_0 in the formula. Therefore, a_9 in my step-by-step corresponds to a_8 in the formula. Therefore, to compute a_9 in my step-by-step, it's equal to a_8 in the formula, which is (9/2)*3^8 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^8 = 6561.\n\nSo, a_8 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (59049/2) - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nAh, there it is! So, in my step-by-step, a_9 corresponds to a_8 in the formula, which is 29524. Therefore, when I computed up to a_9 =29524, that's correct because it's a_8 in the formula. Then, the final step is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches the formula's a_9 =88573, but wait, no. Wait, according to the formula, a_9 (formula's a_9) is (9/2)*3^9 -1/2=88573. But in my step-by-step, a_9 is 29524, which is formula's a_8. So, the final answer is 3*a_9 (step-by-step) =3*29524=88572, which is one less than the formula's a_9=88573. Wait, that can't be. There's a confusion here. Let me clarify:\n\nThe formula gives a_n where a_0=4, a_1=13, a_2=40,..., a_9=88573.\n\nIn my step-by-step, I started with a_1=4, a_2=13,..., a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, in the formula, a_9=88573 corresponds to my a_10=88573. But the original expression only has 9 layers, so the formula's a_9 would correspond to my a_10, which is beyond the problem's scope. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute up to a_9 in my step-by-step, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572, which is consistent with both methods, considering the index shift. So, I think my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and the confusion came from the index alignment in the formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final Answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.

Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct. Then Layer 9: 9841 *3 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So yes, that would be 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of Layer n. So, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = A, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3A = 1\n-2A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which could be useful if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that a formula exists for such nested expressions.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing up to Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Using the derived formula for the nth layer, L\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we confirm Layer 9 is 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the earlier layers, I might have made a mistake because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make an error. Let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me confirm if that's correct because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, and so on up to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me write down the values again:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each time, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. By recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form solution, I avoided the tedious step-by-step computation and reduced the chance of arithmetic errors. It's always good to check your work, especially when dealing with large numbers and multiple layers of computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we recognize a repeating pattern and use a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer.

Let me check if I did each layer correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in Layer 7.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nWait, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 is 3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9000 = 27,000, 3*800 = 2,400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3.\n\nSo 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nThen 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29,524: Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps for this problem, since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step is feasible.\n\nBut just to explore, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for any layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is n=9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so the final answer is 88,572. That seems correct based on both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to confirm.\n\nCompute L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n from 1 to 9:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (27 -1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out with the formula. Thus, the final computation is 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we confirm Layer 9 as 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. First, substitute n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's plug the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, from a_1 = 4 = 3A + B. Since B = -1/2, then 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a faster way by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. But since I've already solved it using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

Let me check my calculation again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let's see, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 4, as we saw earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we can determine each layer's value. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, each layer n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer. Looking at the layers: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. This is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let me assume L(n) = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is L1=4, which corresponds to n=1. The outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. So, Layer 9 = L(9) = (3^(10)-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a time-saver, especially if the expression had more layers. But since there are only nine, both methods work. Either way, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, yes, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. This seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form solution, confirming the result. The final computation yields:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 87572. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the carry-over for the 9. Let me do it more carefully: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 87572. Wait, but when I compute 29524 * 3, let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my earlier multiplication. Let me check where I went wrong. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check my addition:\n\n29524 + 29524: Let's compute 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n9 + 9 = 18 +1=19, write down 9, carry over 1\n2 + 2 = 4 +1=5\nSo 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, adding 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write down 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n5 + 2 =7 +1=8\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, it's 87572, but the addition gives 88572. That means I must have made a mistake in my multiplication.\n\nLet me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the addition. Let me recompute 59048 + 29524.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1\n5 + 2 =7 +1=8\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nBut according to the multiplication, it's 87572. There's a discrepancy of 1000. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLet me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier. Let me compute 29524 *3 using another method.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4.\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nAh, so 29524 *3=88572. So earlier, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication, perhaps missing a carry or something. So the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit method? Let me check again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, but that would be 88572, not 87572. So I must have written it down wrong earlier, maybe as 87572, but it's actually 88572. So the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, so I think I made a typo earlier when I thought I had 87572, but it's actually 88572. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nLet me just confirm with another approach. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So after computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've got it now. So the key was to recognize the pattern, compute each layer step by step, and then verify using a different method to catch any multiplication errors. Also, using the recurrence relation helped confirm that the computation was correct. It's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with large numbers, so it's good to cross-check.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)) can be represented as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since it's finite (nine layers), it's a finite geometric series. However, in this case, since each term is 1 plus 3 times the next, it's a bit different, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nI also considered that maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions, and indeed, the recurrence relation provided a neat way to express each layer's value. It's interesting how different mathematical concepts can interplay to solve a problem. In the future, I can remember to look for patterns and consider using recurrence relations or other methods to simplify nested expressions.\n\nIn summary, by methodically computing each layer from the inside out and verifying my calculations, I arrived at the solution. It was a bit time-consuming, but patience paid off.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost result by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we confirm that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   - Final Result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive pattern. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if that works with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final answer is 88572.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n... and so on.\n\nIn general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I recognize that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiply by 3, so the final result is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n- \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier when computing the layers. Let me double-check each layer because that's where errors can creep in. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives us 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds one. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3(...). So, each time, we have a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nFrom the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nTherefore, my computation seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and multiplying the final layer by 3 gives the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step. It might be a bit tedious, but it's reliable.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me recompute the layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, yes, 87572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which seems correct based on Layer 8 being 9841. Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, that seems right. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 87572. Hmm, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3. Let me compute it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000; 9000 + 9000 = 18000; 500 + 500 = 1000; 20 + 20 = 40; 4 + 4 = 8. So, adding those up: 40000 + 18000 = 58000; 58000 + 1000 = 59000; 59000 + 40 = 59040; 59040 + 8 = 59048. Then, adding the third 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 50000 + 20000 = 70000; 9000 + 9000 = 18000; 400 + 500 = 900; 40 + 20 = 60; 8 + 4 = 12. Adding those: 70000 + 18000 = 88000; 88000 + 900 = 88900; 88900 + 60 = 88960; 88960 + 12 = 88972. Wait, that's different from the previous result. So, which one is correct? 29524 * 3: I think I messed up the previous calculation. Let me compute it properly using standard multiplication. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 87572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88972. That's a discrepancy. Clearly, I made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the addition again. 29524 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit:\n\n29524\n+29524\n--------\nUnits place: 4 + 4 = 8\nTens place: 2 + 2 = 4\nHundreds place: 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\nThousands place: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 (carry) = 19, write down 9, carry over 1.\nTen-thousands place: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 (carry) = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, adding another 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's different from before. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. But earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. Now, there's a conflict. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me compute 29524 * 3 in another way. 29524 * 3: Break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nAh, so that's where the error was. Earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have miscounted the digits. So, actually, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, my initial multiplication was wrong. That changes things. So, the correct final answer should be 88572, not 87572. Let me go back and check where I went wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, when I did the digit-by-digit, I had:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572. But the correct result is 88572. So, I must have misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x      3\n    -----------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, but 2*3=6, plus any carry? Wait, let's do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Wait, no, carry is 1 from the previous step, so 9*3=27 +1=28. So, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. So, I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was correct, but I must have misread the result earlier. So, the final answer is 88572. That makes sense because when I broke it down into place values, I also got 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the correct computation is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. I think my confusion earlier was due to a miscalculation when I tried to add 29524 three times, but breaking it down into place values clarified it. So, the final answer should be 88572. I feel confident about this now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I think I did this correctly. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer helps prevent mistakes. I was worried at first that I might have messed up a multiplication or addition step, but going through each layer carefully and then verifying the final multiplication seems to confirm that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence.\n\nFirst, plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B =4.\n\nNow, let's plug n=2 into the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 +1 =3*4 +1=13.\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B=9A + B=13.\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B =4\n\n2)9A + B =13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B)=13 -4 =>6A=9 =>A=9/6=3/2=1.5.\n\nNow plug A=3/2 into equation1: 3*(3/2) + B=4 =>9/2 + B=4 =>B=4 -9/2= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, L_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms the answer I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. It's reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same result.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found a formula that gives the value of each layer directly. Using this formula, I computed the 9th layer and then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved by recognizing it as a geometric series. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is when we ignore the constant term: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049)/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even found a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer sequentially, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Calculation:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
