    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n- 29524\n- Multiply by 3:\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n- 2*3=6, write 6\n\nWait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12: write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7: write 7\n5 * 3 =15: write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2\n2 *3=6 +2=8: write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 *3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12 = 60000 +27000 =87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, ensuring that each layer is correctly calculated.\n\nLet me write it out again, step by step:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute from the inside out:\n\n1. Compute the innermost 1+3:\n   1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n   1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n   1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n   1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n   1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n   1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n   1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n   1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n   1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3:\n    3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be extra careful, maybe I can compute it using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, which would be the result of the innermost 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 +3=4, then a_2 =1 +3*a_1=13, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nWait, let me think again. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 =4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2= 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2 works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern which can be modeled using a recurrence relation.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Let's denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence relation is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution for such a recurrence when it's homogeneous and has constant coefficients can be found using the formula for the nth term. Specifically, for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the closed-form solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but wait, actually, in our case, L_1 is 4, so maybe it's better to adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, let's consider that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for such equations. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. We know that L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a closed-form formula, and confirmed that it gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, is that right? Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up each part: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Let me write down the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result.

So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This results in a geometric progression, which can be solved using a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 29524 * 2 = 59048, then add 29524 to that: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer follows a certain formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Looking at the layers, each layer n is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This seems like a geometric sequence or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, plugging back into the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's check what n is. Wait, starting from a_1 as Layer 1, then Layer 9 would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed before. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. If I expand the entire expression, it might look like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))), which would result in a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to express it that way. Starting from the innermost term: 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, moving out: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. But perhaps if I expand the entire expression, it's equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))) with nine layers. If I expand this, it's similar to a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nIf I distribute the 3s, it's like:\n\n3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))).\n\nWait, that seems messy. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the sum: Each time, you have a term that's 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=9, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, but I think I've already considered that with the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've solved that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I had before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recursive formula and finding a closed-form expression confirmed the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 Wait, that seems like each layer is adding another power of 3. Let's see: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which matches. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40, which is correct. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Each layer is summing a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^n, so the sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be simplified using the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Recognizing this as a geometric series allows us to find a closed-form solution. The final computation leads to the result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can use the method of solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have continued computing each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation makes it more efficient, especially if there were more layers. It's also a good way to verify the result because it reduces the chance of arithmetic errors when multiplying step by step. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently and confirm that the final result is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Hmm, that seems right. So, I think I did it correctly. I just need to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds one more 3*(...). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of 1+3 parts. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count: 1. 1+3 (innermost) 2. 1+3(1+3) 3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) 4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) 5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) 6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) 9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, yes, there are nine layers. So, my initial computation was correct, going up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...).

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, let me write it as 29524: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523.

Wait, but I think I might have miscalculated earlier. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because if that's wrong, everything else is off. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

But let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute them incorrectly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step seems feasible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 *3=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.

Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the 2, we're done. Wait, so the multiplication would be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLet me go through the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so after the 9, there's no more digits, so we write down 29 as 9 and carry over 2, but since there are no more digits, we just add the carry over. Wait, actually, 9841 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it properly:\n\n9841\n\u00d7    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carry 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carry 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write down the 2. So, 9841 * 3 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer to verify: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems like all the steps check out. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way. Let me think if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. This recurrence relation can be solved, but since it's only nine terms, manual computation is feasible. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to look at it, using the recurrence relation. That's reassuring because both methods gave me the same result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Maybe I made a mistake in the breakdown. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.

First, add 29,524 + 29,524: 29,524 + 20,000 = 49,524\n\n49,524 + 9,524 = 59,048\n\nNow, add another 29,524 to 59,048:\n\n59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048\n\n79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1+3(...) adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 this is the outermost, so the innermost is the last one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count from the inside out. Let me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3. So, my earlier computation was correct: Layer 9 is 29,524, and 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let me verify each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, 3*29,524: Let me compute this carefully.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 using another method. Let's break down 29,524:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nAdding all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSame result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard multiplication algorithm:\n\n   29,524\n\u00d7        3\n_________\n   88,572\n\nYes, that's how it would look.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using another approach, like recognizing a pattern or formula. Let me see if this expression follows a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(inner expression)}\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n   - **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n   - **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n   - **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\).\n   - \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 2*3=6, write 6. So, writing from top to bottom: 6 7 7 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be a 6-digit number. Wait, let me do it properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is 88572. That seems correct because 30000 * 3 is 90000, and 29524 is slightly less, so 88572 makes sense.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recount each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be represented as a geometric series or something like that, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step seems manageable.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost. Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... and so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that Layer 9 value.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify the multiplication once more to be sure. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 differently.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use another method to compute 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I believe the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached.

Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Then 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 1,093*3: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280*3: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 9,841*3: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k and c are constants. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (c=1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88,572. That confirms my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might have been another approach. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand this, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k, but wait, no, because each term is multiplied by 3, not added directly.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, it's more like a geometric progression with each term being 1 + 3*(sum of the rest). Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.\n\nBut since I already have a formula for a_n, and it's confirmed by both step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time, I'll write down each multiplication carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I've done this correctly. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations now.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write a small program or use a calculator to compute this, I could verify it, but since I've done it manually twice and used a formula, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, I arrived at the value 29,524 for the innermost expression, then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer, 88,572. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I derived a formula that confirmed the same result. Therefore, I'm certain that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29,524.

    "text": " Wait, no, let me write it as 29524: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through the layers again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * (L_0) + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4. Let me check. Let's see, if n=1, L_1=4. Let me see if that formula works. Let me consider L_n = 3^n * C + (1*(3^n - 1))/(3 - 1). Let me compute C. Using n=1: L_1 = 3^1 * C + (3^1 -1)/2 = 3C + (3 -1)/2 = 3C + 1. We know L_1=4, so 3C +1=4 \u21d2 3C=3 \u21d2 C=1. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = 3^n * 1 + (3^n -1)/2 = 3^n + (3^n -1)/2. Let's combine the terms: (2*3^n + 3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the original expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. But since I had to compute each layer step by step anyway, maybe the formula isn't necessary unless I'm dealing with a very large number of layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each one step by step was manageable. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. All these steps check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, a_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which also gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated step by step. Using a recurrence relation, a closed-form formula is derived, confirming the result.

Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit: 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, I computed 9 layers correctly. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the formula confirms our step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is 1 + 3*(next term).

Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which forms a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so maybe we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check with smaller layers to ensure my approach is correct. For example, if I had only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. According to the formula, n=1: a_1=4, then 3*a_1=12. Correct. If I have two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. According to the formula, a_2=13, 3*a_2=39. Correct. Similarly, with three layers: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39? Wait, no, wait. Wait, three layers would be: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(13))=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. According to the formula, a_3=40, 3*a_3=120. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). \n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.

So, I think I did that correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that matches what I did earlier. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve this using a formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to do it step by step. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27.

Write down 7.\n\nSo putting it all together, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Thousands place: 7.\n\nNext: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Ten-thousands place: 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Hundred-thousands place: 7, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Millions place: 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the places are:\n\n- 4: units\n- 2: tens\n- 5: hundreds\n- 9: thousands\n- 2: ten thousands\n\nSo when I multiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's 88572. But let me check with another method. 3 \u00d7 29524: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Is that right? Let me double-check the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go back and compute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7Layer9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So each layer builds on the previous one, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's interesting because each layer is growing exponentially, but since it's only 9 layers deep, the number isn't too large.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So when I computed Layer 9, that's the innermost one, right? Wait, no, actually, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. So the outermost expression is 3\u00d7(Layer9). So I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try solving it.\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nBut that doesn't make sense here because our terms are positive and increasing. So maybe the particular solution is not a constant but a linear function. Let's try a particular solution of the form a_n = A*n + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A*n + B = 1 + 3*(A*(n-1) + B)\n\nExpanding the right side: 1 + 3A*(n-1) + 3B = 1 + 3A*n - 3A + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*n + B\n\nRight side: 3A*n + (1 - 3A + 3B)\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nA = 3A => A - 3A = 0 => -2A = 0 => A = 0\n\nBut if A = 0, then substituting back into the equation: 0 + B = 1 + 3*(0 + B) => B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nAgain, same result. So the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution: a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nBut since our initial condition a_1 = 4, let's use that to find C.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because I want to be absolutely sure. Let's compute a_9 using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So both methods, step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation formula, give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final computation leads to the result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step using another method or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help confirm this result. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. This recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to recap, I broke down the problem by computing each nested layer step by step, then I derived a formula for each layer using a recurrence relation, verified the formula with known values, and then used it to compute the outermost layer, which I then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. This method seems solid, and both approaches led me to the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) but wait, that's not exactly the case because the innermost term is just 1 +3, not another E. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me think. Each time, the coefficient is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then 13, 40, etc. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, in the end, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k. Let me try to express E as a sum. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Let me expand this step by step. Let me denote the innermost part as a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. So, E=3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, since each term is multiplied by 3 each time. The formula I found earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, but let me verify that again because when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

Let me compute this again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = Now, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0; so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems like a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I did before. But is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Maybe using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form P, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost layer is a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just think again\u2014did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...)), and each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the first 3, each time you have a (1+3(...)), that's a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n3. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n4. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n5. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n6. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n7. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n8. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n9. Inside that: 3(1+3))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, yes, a_9 is the outermost layer, and then we multiply by 3. So, the formula applies correctly. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 88572 is the correct answer. I think I'm confident with this result now. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me verify that multiplication again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step calculations. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 3 * 3 = 9. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems off.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nLet me recompute the layers step by step again to verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is indeed 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression.\n\nThis expression looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous term. So, for example, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then a particular solution is added if the nonhomogeneous term is a constant.\n\nBut maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSubstitute P into the recurrence:\n\nP = 1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3*P = 1 => -2*P = 1 => P = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use this formula to find a_n for n=9, which is the outermost layer.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as I found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9. But in my formula, a_n represents 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so a_9 is indeed the innermost part. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form expression. It's much faster and reduces the chance of error from manually computing each layer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify the computation of 3^{11}.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177147. Then, subtract 3 to get 177144, divide by 2 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just realized that the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, which would correspond to n=9 layers. But in my formula, a_n corresponds to n layers, starting from a_1. So, if the innermost is a_1, then the outermost would be a_9. So, the expression is 3*a_9, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after nine layers. So, yes, that's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds an exponent to the 3's power. Since we have nine layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 would be 3^{10}, but adjusted by the constants.\n\nBut I think the formula approach is solid here. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation of the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer is correctly computed, leading to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost value is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified each part thoroughly. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations.
