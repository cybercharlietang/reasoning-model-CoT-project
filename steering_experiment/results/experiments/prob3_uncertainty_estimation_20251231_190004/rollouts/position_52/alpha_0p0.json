Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that multiplication again. Maybe I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNo more digits, so write down the carry over if any. But 2 * 3 was the last digit, so it's 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to verify. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all the layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

Each layer is computed step by step, and the result is multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. **Layer 2:** Use the result from Layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. **Layer 3:** Use the result from Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. **Layer 4:** Use the result from Layer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. **Layer 5:** Use the result from Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. **Layer 6:** Use the result from Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. **Layer 7:** Use the result from Layer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. **Layer 8:** Use the result from Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. **Layer 9:** Use the result from Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

But wait, let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, but when I counted the layers, I might have miscounted. Let me recount the number of layers to make sure I didn't go too far or too short.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times the pattern repeats.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let's count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, my initial computation of 9 layers is correct, and the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that when I computed Layer 9, I correctly accounted for all layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, multiplying by 3:\n\n29524 * 3: Let's do this multiplication carefully.\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, we get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 20000 = 60000\n\n3 \u00d7 9000 = 27000\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1500\n\n3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems to add up correctly. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost. The recurrence relation is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, that can't be right because 3 * 29524 is actually 88572?

Each layer is correctly computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me explore that possibility. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula gives the same result. That's reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might also be possible, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a linear recurrence rather than a simple geometric series. However, the formula we derived is a closed-form expression, which is efficient for computation. So, in conclusion, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final result of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1.

So, where did I go wrong? Let me check again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, the number is 87572, but that's incorrect because the correct result is 88572. I must have misaligned the digits. Wait, perhaps I missed a digit. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\nSo, the result is 87572. But according to the correct calculation, it's 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the way I'm writing down the digits. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a digit. Let me count the digits in 29524: it's 5 digits. So, when multiplying, the result should also be 5 or 6 digits. Let's see:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572. But according to the correct calculation, it's 88572. Wait, that suggests that I have a mistake in my multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier layers.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error there.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nAs established earlier, this is where I made a mistake. So, let's compute 3*29524 correctly.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I multiplied digit by digit, I got 87572, which is incorrect. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication?\n\nAh, I see now. When I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have miscounted the digits or the carryover. Let me try again carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 7, 8. Wait, that's 87572, which is wrong. But when I broke it down into place values, I got 88572. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm writing the digits in the wrong order. Let me try writing it out step by step, ensuring I place each digit correctly.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 0\n\nNow, writing the digits from left to right as we computed them:\n\nTen thousands place: 8\nThousands place: 7\nHundreds place: 5\nTens place: 7\nUnits place: 2\n\nSo, the number is 87572, but we know from the place value method that it's 88572. So, there's a contradiction here. I must be making a mistake in the digit placement.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\nDigit positions (from right): 4 (units), 2 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 9 (thousands), 2 (ten thousands)\n\nSo, when I multiply each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n- Ten thousands: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nNow, writing the digits from ten thousands to units:\n\n8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572.\n\nBut this contradicts the place value method, which gave 88572. So, where is the mistake? I think the error is in the initial assumption that Layer 9 is 29524. Let me double-check the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3*29524 must be 88572. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication? It seems I have a consistent result from the place value method, but the digit-by-digit method is giving me a different answer, which suggests I'm making a mistake in the digit placement. Let me try another approach: using the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\nWrite 29524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing the digits as we go:\n\nStarting from the right, we have 2, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 8. So, the number is 87572. But this contradicts the correct answer of 88572. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write the digits in the correct places:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place: 7\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 7\n- Ten thousands place: 8\n\nSo, the number is 87572. But according to the place value method, it's 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the place value method. Wait, no, the place value method is correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. So, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left as we compute them: 2, 7, 5, 7, 8. But when writing the number, we need to place them correctly from left to right. So, the first digit we compute is the units place (2), then tens (7), then hundreds (5), then thousands (7), then ten thousands (8). So, the number is 87572. But this contradicts the correct answer of 88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the place value method earlier.\n\nWait, no, the place value method is correct because:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572, which means I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. It seems I'm miscounting the digits or misplacing them. Let me try to write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nNow, writing the digits from right to left as they were computed: 2, 7, 5, 7, 8. But when constructing the number, we need to place them from right to left, so the first digit computed is the units place, then tens, etc. So, the digits are:\n\nUnits: 2\nTens: 7\nHundreds: 5\nThousands: 7\nTen thousands: 8\n\nSo, the number is 87572, which is wrong. But according to the place value method, it's 88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps I should trust the place value method more since it's more systematic.\n\nGiven that, I'll conclude that 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but then the initial digit-by-digit multiplication must be wrong. Let me check using another method: using the distributive property.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer correctly, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer's result is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 3 * 3 = 9 + 1 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4. So:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carryover 0 doesn't matter.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we get 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carryover 1\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carryover 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\nSo that's 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 5\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 8\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I just recalled that sometimes when you have expressions like this, they can form a geometric series or something similar, which might have a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me think if that's possible here.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), but in this case, it's finite with nine layers. So, it's not an infinite series, but a finite nested expression. Therefore, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a finite nested expression.\n\nAlternatively, since I already computed each layer step by step and arrived at 88572, perhaps that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I started computing, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and Layer 9 as the outermost, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 through a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, multiplying a_9 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I was computing each a_n, I was using a_1 as the innermost, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n adds another layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, is there a formula for a_n in such a linear recurrence? Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u2192 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u2192 -2*a_p = 1 \u2192 a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying through both iterative computation and using the recurrence relation formula, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this multiplication again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to compute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's do it step by step: 29524\n\u00d7        3\n----------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up any step, the final answer will be wrong. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct. Hmm, seems like each step is accurate. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I also get 88572. That confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have kept computing each layer manually, but recognizing the recurrence relation makes it much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's interesting how recognizing patterns can simplify the problem-solving process. So, in summary, by either expanding each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrived at the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By iteratively computing each subsequent layer, we find that the outermost layer \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the correct product is 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier method where I broke it down into 20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4, each multiplied by 3 and summed up to 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I got confused earlier when I tried to write the digits from the multiplication steps, but now it makes sense.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to see how many terms there are. Each time, we're adding a 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). There are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. Using the formula we derived earlier, each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=88572. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum, maybe I can represent it as a sum of 3's raised to certain powers. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13=40. Then:1 + 3*40=121. Then:1 + 3*121=364. Then:1 + 3*364=1093. Then:1 + 3*1093=3280. Then:1 + 3*3280=9841. Then:1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that's consistent with the previous calculations. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Maybe to double-check, I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the formula holds. Let's say I have just 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. According to the formula, L_1=4, then 3*4=12. Correct. If I have 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. According to the formula, L_2=13, then 3*13=39. Correct. 3 layers: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39? Wait, no, wait. Wait, with 3 layers, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))). Let's compute that: Innermost:1+3=4. Middle:1+3*4=13. Outer:1+3*13=40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40=120. According to the formula, L_3=40, then 3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases, so I think it's safe to say that for 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the 9 layers. Finally, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the result of the 9th layer. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me see if there's a formula I can apply here. The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's finite, with 9 layers, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is actually 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*( (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) ) if r \u2260 1. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. Wait, but our a_1 is 4, so let's adjust the formula accordingly. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c. Here, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. So, to recap: The innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the 9th layer, we get 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives us the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, we reach 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the steps. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each one is manageable. Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly, saving time. But since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step was manageable.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840.

Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write out the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is (3^{n} -1)/2, but since I had to compute up to 9 layers, using the formula is more efficient. Either way, the result is the same.

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 *3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000 =87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500 =88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that matches. So 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because I feel like maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous computations.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so Layer1 is the innermost, and Layer9 is the outermost. So when I compute Layer9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiply by 3 to get the final result. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which would save time if the expression were longer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here.\n\nEach layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nSo, L(1)=4\n\nL(2)=1 +3*4=13\n\nL(3)=1 +3*13=40\n\nL(4)=1 +3*40=121\n\nL(5)=1 +3*121=364\n\nL(6)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nL(7)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nL(8)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nL(9)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general form for a linear recurrence is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by L(n) = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nSo, let's apply this formula. Given L(1)=4, we can find C.\n\nSo, L(n) = C*3^n + (1/(3-1)) = C*3^n + 1/2.\n\nNow, plug in n=1: L(1)=4 = C*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3C + 1/2 => 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => C = (7/2)/3 = 7/6.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L(n) = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2.\n\nSimplify this: (7/6)*3^n = (7/6)*3^n = (7*3^n)/6 = (7*3^{n})/6.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as L(n) = (7*3^{n} + 3)/6, because 1/2 = 3/6, so adding that gives (7*3^n +3)/6.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L(1)= (7*3 +3)/6 = (21 +3)/6=24/6=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (7*9 +3)/6=(63+3)/6=66/6=11. Wait, but earlier I had L(2)=13. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, let's recast the formula correctly. The general solution for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is L(n) = (L(1) - b/(a-1)) *a^{n-1} + b/(a-1).\n\nIn this case, a=3, b=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, L(n) = (4 - 1/(3-1)) *3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1).\n\nSimplify: 4 - 1/2 = 7/2, so L(n) = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: (7/2)*3^{0} +1/2=7/2 +1/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (7/2)*3^{1} +1/2= (21/2) +1/2=22/2=11. But earlier, I calculated L(2)=13. So there's a discrepancy here. That means either my formula is wrong or my initial calculations were wrong.\n\nWait, let's check L(2) again. If L(1)=4, then L(2)=1 +3*4=13. But according to the formula, it's 11. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the formula for the linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard form is L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, with solution L(n) = a^{n} * (L(0) - b/(a-1)) + b/(a-1).\n\nWait, in our case, L(1)=4, which would correspond to n=1. So, maybe the formula should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conditions. Let me try to derive the formula again.\n\nWe have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) -3L(n-1)=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 +3*A => A =1 +3A => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 =>4 =3C -1/2 =>3C=4 +1/2=9/2 =>C=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the correct formula is L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, n=9, so L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because earlier when I tried to apply the formula, I got a different result, but now it's correct. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial application.\n\nSo, using the formula, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, for n=9, L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to see if it matches.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the final computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is defined as L(n)=1 +3*L(n-1), and we have L(9)=29524, then the entire expression is 3*L(9)=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed step by step. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L(9) = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me see. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find a general formula for the nth layer, which confirms that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Let me double-check the layers because if I made a mistake there, everything else would be off. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here to compute this more efficiently without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0: Well, if n=0, a_0 would be 1 + 3*a_{-1}, which doesn't make sense here, so maybe it's better to solve it using the method for linear recurrences. Alternatively, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, the outermost layer is a_9, so the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula gives the same answer without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is larger. But since the problem only has nine layers, even computing each step isn't too bad. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me write down the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, that seems messy. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have added incorrectly. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. As before, 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's per digit. Let me do it properly:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572. Yep, that matches my previous calculation. So, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers, I'll go through one more time quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572.\n\nYep, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any mistakes in the multiplication or addition steps. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it down: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check all my steps because I don't want to make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the final step is to multiply the result by 3. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute a_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a geometric progression, but since I already have the formula, it's easier to use that. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So when I multiply by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's 88,572. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524.

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which might make it easier to compute for higher n without computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That makes me confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2.

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There's nothing left, so write down the 8. So putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did the initial breakdown, I thought it was 88572, but let me verify with another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to verify. This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, this recursive formula can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. To find C, we can solve for the steady-state value where a_n = a_{n-1} = C. So, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recursive formula and verifying with a closed-form solution, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a five-digit number. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way to confirm. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final computation is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Wait, does that mean there are nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3? Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each time wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does 3(...) occur? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n...\nUp to Layer 9, which would be the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), then multiplied by 3. So, my calculation is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)): Starting from the first 3(...), each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times does 3*(...) occur? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each is 1 + 3*(previous). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous), and then the final 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, my calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so adding 29,524 three times gives me 88,572, but multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives me 87,572. That's a difference of 1,000. So, I must have made a mistake in my multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when multiplying. Let me write it out again:\n\n   29524\nx     3\n--------\n?\n\nLet me write each digit properly:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Write 7, carry 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87,572. But that contradicts the addition result of 88,572. There's a mistake here, but I can't figure out where. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the layers again. Maybe I messed up one of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute 29,524 * 3 more carefully:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Thousands place: 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Ten-thousands place: 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Hundred-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572.\n\nBut when I add 29,524 three times, I get 88,572. That's a problem because they should be the same. There must be a mistake in one of these calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29,524 three times again:\n\nFirst addition: 29,524 + 29,524.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n29,524\n+29,524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8.\n\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n5 + 5 = 10. Write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, the sum is 59,048.\n\nNow, adding another 29,524:\n\n59,048\n+29,524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572.\n\nWait, so adding 29,524 three times gives me 88,572, but multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives me 87,572. That's a difference of 1,000. There's a clear mistake here, but I can't figure out where. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a \"1+3(...)\", so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Each time we have a 1+3(...) which itself contains another 1+3(...), etc. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that.\n\nLet me try to count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, since the expression has nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are nine layers of 1+3(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is nine, which I correctly computed earlier.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I got 87,572, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572. So, clearly, the correct answer is 88,572, and I must have made a mistake in my multiplication earlier. Perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nLet me try multiplying 29,524 by 3 again, carefully:\n\n29,524\nx     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the product is 87,572. Wait, but that's conflicting with the addition result.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition method. Let me try adding 29,524 three times again:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048.\n\n59,048 + 29,524:\n\nLet me add 59,048 + 29,524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88,572.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 88,572 from addition and 87,572 from multiplication. There's a clear inconsistency here, which means I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the layers earlier. Let me check Layer 9 again.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nWait, 3*9841: 9841 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25. Write 5, carry 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29. Write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25. Write 5, carry 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29. Write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841 * 3 = 29,523. Correct.\n\nThen, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 should be 88,572. Therefore, my earlier multiplication must have been wrong. Let me try multiplying 29,524 by 3 once more.\n\n29,524\nx     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Thousands place: 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Ten-thousands place: 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Hundred-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87,572.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the addition result. I must be making a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute 29,524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, 29,524 is 30,000 minus 476. Therefore, 29,524 * 3 = 30,000 * 3 - 476 * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That's the correct answer.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in my earlier digit-by-digit multiplication. It's easy to misalign digits or make a carryover error when doing it manually. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward, then multiplying the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. But let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Simplify: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, expanding it all, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this as a sum. Let's denote S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Each layer adds another 3*... So, expanding S, we get S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to express this as a sum of powers of 3. Each time we go a layer out, we multiply by 3 and add 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 3, then each layer adds another term. Wait, but actually, when you expand the entire expression, each 1 contributes a term multiplied by 3 to the power of its depth. Let me think. Let's consider the innermost term: 1 + 3. That's 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) =1 + 12=13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*13=40, and so on. Each time, the term is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand S, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to express S as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, each 1 inside gets multiplied by 3 multiple times. Specifically, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times (since there are nine layers, but the innermost is at the ninth layer). Wait, let me see. Let's count the layers. The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1, up to Layer 9. So, each 1 in Layer k is multiplied by 3^{9 - k} times. Hmm, maybe. Let me try to write S as the sum: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3^8, 3^7, ..., 3^0. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost 1 is in Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, when we expand, that 1 will be multiplied by 3^8.\n\n- The next 1 is in Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). When expanded, that 1 will be multiplied by 3^7.\n\nAnd so on, up to the outermost 1, which is in Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 0, which is 0 perhaps? Wait, no, because the outermost is Layer 9. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, when we compute S = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 8)). Expanding this, it's 3*1 + 3*3*(Layer 8) = 3 + 9*(Layer 8). Similarly, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), so S becomes 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 3 + 9 + 27*(Layer 7). Continuing this way, each 1 contributes 3^{n} where n is the number of layers it's nested within. So, the innermost 1 in Layer 9 contributes 3^9, the next contributes 3^8, etc., up to the outermost 1 in Layer 1 contributing 3^1, and finally, there's the initial 3 multiplied by all these. Wait, let me formalize this.\n\nIf we have nine layers, each 1 in Layer k (from 1 to 9) contributes 3^{9 - k + 1} to the total sum. Wait, let me check:\n\n- The innermost 1 is in Layer 9: when expanded, it's multiplied by 3^8 (since it's inside 8 layers of multiplication by 3). So, its contribution is 1*3^8.\n\n- The next 1 is in Layer 8: when expanded, it's multiplied by 3^7, so contribution is 1*3^7.\n\n- This continues up to Layer 1: the 1 there is multiplied by 3^1 (since it's inside 1 layer of multiplication by 3 beyond itself).\n\n- Then, the initial 3 outside all layers would be 3*(sum of all these 1*3^{n} terms). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, when you expand it all, you get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). So, each 1 is multiplied by 3^{number of layers above it}.\n\nLet me count the number of layers each 1 is inside:\n\n- The innermost 1 is in Layer 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it, each contributing a multiplication by 3).\n\n- The next 1 is in Layer 8, so it's multiplied by 3^7.\n\n- ...\n\n- The 1 in Layer 1 is multiplied by 3^1.\n\nSo, the total sum inside the expression is the sum from k=1 to 9 of 1*3^{9 - k}.\n\nWait, but 9 - k where k=1 to 9 would give exponents from 8 down to 0. So, the sum would be 3^8 + 3^7 + ... + 3^0.\n\nThat's a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and 9 terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). So, sum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but that's the sum inside the expression. The entire expression is 3 times this sum. So, S = 3*(sum) = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but earlier I got 88572. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, no, wait. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the sum I just calculated is the sum inside the expression, which is Layer 9, right? Because Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, so the sum of all the 1s is 9841, which is Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*9841 = 29523. But that contradicts my earlier result of 88572. So, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum. Let me clarify.\n\nIf each 1 in Layer k contributes 3^{9 - k} to the sum, then the sum is:\n\nSum = 3^8 + 3^7 + 3^6 + ... + 3^0.\n\nWhich is a geometric series with 9 terms, starting from 3^0 to 3^8.\n\nSum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, Layer9 = Sum = 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed step by step, I got Layer9 as 29524, leading to 3*29524=88572. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let's check the step-by-step computation again. When I computed Layer1 through Layer9, I got Layer9 as 29524, but according to the geometric series, it's 9841. That's a big difference. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let's go back to the step-by-step computation.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nWait, so according to this, Layer9 is 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series approach, the sum inside Layer9 is 9841, leading to 3*9841=29523.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...). Let's see:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3*(...) terms. Each time you have a 3*(...), that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each 3*(...) is a new layer. So, the expression has 9 layers of 3*(...), starting from Layer1 up to Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I expanded using the geometric series, I considered 9 layers, each contributing 3^{8}, 3^{7}, etc., but that gave me a different result than the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the geometric series approach is considering the sum of 1's contributions, but in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so the step-by-step approach is accurate, and the geometric series approach might have an off-by-one error.\n\nLet me try to reconcile this. The step-by-step computation shows that Layer9 is 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nThe geometric series approach, when correctly applied, should give the same result. Let me try again.\n\nIf I consider the entire expression S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me denote the innermost expression as E1 =1 +3=4. Then E2=1 +3*E1=13, E3=1 +3*E2=40, and so on up to E9=29524.\n\nSo, S=3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider expanding S:\n\nS = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nExpanding each layer:\n\nS = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n= 3 + 9 + 27*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nContinuing this expansion, each 1 contributes 3^k, where k is the number of times it's been multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the total sum would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/ (3 -1)) = 3*(19683 -1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 =29523.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the step-by-step approach which gave 88572. So, where's the mistake?\n\nWait, no, perhaps the geometric series approach is missing something. Because each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), the expansion isn't just adding 3^k, but each term is 1 + 3*(previous), so the total sum is not just a simple geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider that each Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as I derived earlier. So, Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, S=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the geometric series approach where I thought of the sum as 3^8 +3^7 +...+3^0=9841 is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so the contributions are different.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the step-by-step approach correctly builds each layer, whereas the geometric series approach I took earlier was incorrectly applied.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572, as per the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the outermost layer's value and then multiply it by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems high, but let's check with another method. Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). It's a nested multiplication where each layer adds 1 and then multiplies by 3. This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. In general, for such expressions, if there are n layers, the value can be calculated using the formula for a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, a_2=1 +3*a_1, and so on. So, a_{k} =1 +3*a_{k-1} for k from 2 to 9, since there are 9 layers. This is a recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_k =1 +3*a_{k-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_k^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D =1 +3*D => D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When k=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2 =3C => 9/2=3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor k=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nk=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nk=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nk=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nk=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nk=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nk=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nk=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To ensure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing from the top: 8 8 5 7 2 4? Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no, actually, when you write the digits from right to left, it's 2,7,5,7,8,5,7,8,8? Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\nNext:5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0.\n\nNext:9*3=27 \u21927, carry 2.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0.\n\nNext:5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\nNext:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\nNext:2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (from the last multiplication), then 8, 5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2, 4. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me list them in order from the first carry to the last:\n\nWait, actually, when multiplying, the digits are written from right to left, so the first digit is 2, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 8, then 8. Wait, that would make the number 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 *3.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000 =87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value. After computing the innermost layer (Layer 1) as 4, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated until Layer 9 is reached, which is 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, resulting in 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got a different number. That must mean I made a mistake in that method. Let me check again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. There are no more digits, so write 8. So, the number is 87572. Wait, that conflicts with the other method which gave 88572. Hmm, which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another approach. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add 29524 again: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048 79048 + 9000 = 88048 88048 + 500 = 88548 88548 + 24 = 88572. So, that confirms that 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I might have miscounted the digits or made an error in carrying over. So, the correct final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have messed up the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3(...) expressions. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" segments. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 13. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer4:1 + 3*40=121 Layer5:1 + 3*121=364 Layer6:1 + 3*364=1093 Layer7:1 + 3*1093=3280 Layer8:1 + 3*3280=9841 Layer9:1 + 3*9841=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me think about that for a moment.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I didn't skip any steps, and I double-checked using a different method, so I'm pretty sure the answer is right.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. There are no more digits, so write down the 8. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n- So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify that by another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of each layer is as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was the innermost layer, but in the original expression, each layer is actually being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. Then: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. Then: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. Then: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. Then: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. Then: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. Then: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nAnd then the outermost 3 times that: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. So each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer), and there are 9 such layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, but actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside the first 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers inside the first 3*(...). Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), how many layers are there? Each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3*(...), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the first layer inside is 1 + 3*(...), then the next is another 1 + 3*(...), etc. Let's count the number of 1 + 3*(...) inside the first 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(, we have 1 + 3*(...). Then, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*( occurs inside the first 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3*(, the next is 1 + 3*(, then inside that another 1 + 3*(, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, inside the first 3*(, there are 8 more layers of 1 + 3*(...). Wait, no, that's not correct because the first layer after 3*( is 1 + 3*(...), which is layer 1, then inside that another 1 + 3*(...), which is layer 2, and so on until layer 8, which is (1 + 3). Then, when we compute up to layer 8, that's (1 + 3) = 4, then layer 7 would be 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer 6: 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to layer 1, which is 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 1) = 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, as I did before, but just making sure I'm not making any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so after double-checking each layer, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a formula.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. This is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be expressed in terms of powers of 3, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is straightforward.\n\nIn any case, I think I've computed each layer correctly, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the result of each layer and substitute it into the next until reaching the final value. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Computation:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 9. So, I think I did it correctly. But just to be thorough, let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, the outermost is 3*(Layer9) = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's consider that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that approach. Let's consider expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 =1 + 3*4=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1 +3*40=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +3*121=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +3*364=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to get the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if that's the case. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yep, same as before. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me check. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. In this case, k=3, c=1. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + initial term. Wait, let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me set n starting from 1. So, a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 13. a_3 = 3*a_2 + 1 = 40, etc. The general solution is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + a_0*k^{n}. But in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be... Wait, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula. Let me consider n starting from 0. Let me set a_0 = 1 (since when n=0, the innermost expression is 1+3=4). Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. The solution to this is a homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 => 1 = C - 1/2 => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, starting from n=0, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is layer 1: a_1 = 4, which according to the formula would be (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. Then, a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=13, which matches. a_3 = (81 -1)/2=40, correct. So, for layer k (where k goes from 1 to 9), a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly, saving time. But since I didn't recognize it at first, breaking it down step by step was a good way to ensure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression, then multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, I can check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, starting from the innermost, layer 1 is 1+3, layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), and so on up to layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.
