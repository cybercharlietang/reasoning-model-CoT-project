Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider that.\n\nEach layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then multiply by 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a finite number of terms, maybe it's easier to compute each term as I did before. But perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of a_1.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is similar to a geometric series but with an added constant. The formula we derived is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is neat.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer manually, and both methods gave the same result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've got the right answer here. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but using the formula saved time. I guess recognizing the pattern early on could have been helpful, but since I was unsure at first, breaking it down step by step was a good approach.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the innermost value propagates outward, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13. a_3=1 +3*a2=1+39=40. Hmm, I see that each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply initial condition. For n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 =>4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. So a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula.

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as I did before. Then each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9, which is 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, but since the problem starts at a_1, maybe we can find another equation. Alternatively, let's assume that the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. Good. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572, which is the same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents. This might be a faster way if I recognize the pattern early on. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I can use the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and then multiply by 3. Since there are 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, and 3*a_9 = (3^{11}-3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Either way, I get the same answer. So, I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me recap the steps: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with Layer1=4, then Layer2=13, and so on up to Layer9=29524. 3. Multiply the final layer by 3 to get the result: 3*29524=88572. 4. Alternatively, use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation to compute a_9 and then multiply by 3, arriving at the same result. Both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both approaches lead to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Wait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), so yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, just to make sure, maybe I can compute this in another way, perhaps using a formula for geometric series or something, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, derived a formula, and confirmed the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Wait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake earlier when computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, the outermost is Layer 9, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern that can be expressed in a formula. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's see: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the ninth term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in such a recursive sequence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using a formula. In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSubstituting the assumed form:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term and then multiplying by 3.\n\nEither way, the result is the same: 88572.\n\nJust to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3^10 and 3^11.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^11 -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which is exactly what I got before. So, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula: total expression = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next layer.

But let me double-check my layer computations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression another way or look for a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. Here, c=1, r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - r*a_{n-1} = c. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*r^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: B = c + r*B. So, B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c/(1 - r). But since r \u2260 1, this works. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*r^n + B. Applying initial conditions. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*r^1 + B = A*3 + B = 4. But wait, in our case, a_1 is defined as 4, so let's see if we can express a_n in terms of n.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the indices. Let me consider that a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence, the solution is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nLet me test for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 =1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the particular solution.\n\nWait, let me approach this methodically. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p =1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds true for each layer. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. So that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, each step checks out. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So that's another way to compute it.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, using the formula, it's (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, when I computed Layer 9, that's the innermost expression, right? So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Hmm, the expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. Wait, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust for that. Let me define a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, using the formula: a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * d. Plugging in a_0 =1, d=1: a_n = 3^n * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 * 1 = 3^n + (3^n -1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for each layer. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the expression has 9 layers, that would correspond to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's a more efficient way, but since I was able to compute it step by step, and both methods agree, I'm sure the answer is correct.\n\nI think I'm done here. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with repeated layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step, revealing a pattern that follows a linear recurrence relation.

It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did before. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead me to the same result, which is reassuring.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Since 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to represent the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. Wait, but actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and each outer layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, it's 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as we computed before. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand it. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Thus, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to ensure I haven't made any miscalculations, let me verify the multiplication 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Alternatively, I could consider that each layer is a geometric series or something, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually seems feasible and less error-prone. Another way to think about it is recognizing the pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant each time. Wait, actually, if I consider each step, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some computation time, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify. It's interesting how these nested expressions can sometimes be simplified with a closed-form formula. In any case, after computing each layer carefully and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form expression.

Yep, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), computing each step is straightforward. Alternatively, for a deeper understanding, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost: (1+3), then (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. From the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3) Layer 2: (1+3(Layer1)) Layer3: (1+3(Layer2)) ... Up to Layer9: (1+3(Layer8)) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, 9 layers. So I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually and see if I get the same numbers. Let's compute Layer1 to Layer3 again. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and progressively work our way outward. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a general formula to find the value of the ninth layer, which simplifies the computation. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **General Formula:** Recognizing the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we find the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that's a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula I can use to compute this without expanding each layer. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc., as before. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K -3*K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10=59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

It looks like a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) with only three layers. Let's compute it step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Outermost: 3*13=39. Using the formula: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then 3*a_3=120. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no, in the smaller problem, how many layers do we have? Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) has three layers: innermost is 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 3*40=120. But when I computed it step by step earlier, I thought it was 39, but that must be wrong. Wait, no, in the small problem, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(4))). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) =1 + 3*(1 +12)=1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Then 3*40=120. So, yes, using the formula, a_3=40, then 3*a_3=120. So that's correct. So my method works for that.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation. It's a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using methods for such equations. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A =1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since in this problem, there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable, but knowing the formula is useful.\n\nAlternatively, I can also recognize that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which is similar to a geometric series but with a multiplier inside. The formula we derived shows that it's related to powers of 3.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're effectively scaling the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for nine layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nBut let me verify that again. If n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct. n=2, L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which is correct. n=3, L_3=(81 -1)/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, without computing each layer, I can directly compute L_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my computations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Recognizing the pattern, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the 9th layer efficiently. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. This seems like a geometric series, but let me see if I can model it. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous, and after 9 layers, we have 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120 + 3 = 123. So 1 + 123 = 124. Wait, earlier I thought it was 364. Wait, that's a problem. I must have messed up somewhere. Wait, no, 3*121 is 363, right? Because 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. So 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Correct. Then Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express this using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've double-checked my work enough times, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about this problem in terms of a recursive formula. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 +3=4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 +3 times the previous layer. So, f(2)=1+3*4=13, f(3)=1+3*13=40, and so on up to f(9). Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). Alternatively, I can see if there's a pattern or formula for f(n). The recursive relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1) is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3f(n-1) = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. So that's consistent with our earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{11} directly: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144.

Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but given that it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing this as a geometric series? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So this is a recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Maybe solving this recurrence would give a formula for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. As we saw, the innermost layer is a1 = 4, which is (3^2 -1)/2. Then each subsequent layer adds a power of 3. So, the outermost layer is a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough to be confident.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by evaluating the expression 1 + 3*(previous layer). Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the outermost layer efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought before. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, yes, after computing Layer 9, I multiply by 3 to get the final result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} for n >= 2, and a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C * 3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C * 3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C * 3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. Thus, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times '1+3(' occurs. After the initial 3, there are 9 instances of '1+3(' before the closing parentheses. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers.

Let me count the number of layers:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of '1+3(' after the initial 3. Let me count:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many '1+3(' are there? Let's see:\n\n- The first one is 1+3(...\n- Then another 1+3(...\n- And so on, until we reach the end.\n\nI think there are 8 layers after the initial 3. Wait, because the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, if there are 9 sets of parentheses, that would mean 9 layers?

It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's another way to confirm it. This formula approach seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, it's manageable manually. I don't recall a specific formula for this, but maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2. Simplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L(1)=(3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So then, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify with a different method to ensure there's no mistake. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 +1/2 = 3C => 9/2 =3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recursive formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, when I compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. For the nonhomogeneous part, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can find a particular solution. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution: a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 is given by the formula. So, plugging in a_9: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation with the closed-form formula, or expanding the expression using exponentials\u2014the result is the same: 88572. I think that's thorough enough.
