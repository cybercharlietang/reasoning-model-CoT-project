    "text": " Let me break it down. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.

Write 7, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 29524 has digits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12: units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: tens place is 7.\n\n5*3=15: hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: ten thousands place is 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, but when I did it earlier, I thought of 88572, but maybe I should verify this multiplication another way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.

So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88,572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula. Each layer seems to be defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1=4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3=4, a_2=1 +3*a1=13, a3=1 +3*a2=40, etc. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a9, we can compute it as a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88,572. Alternatively, using the closed-form, since the original expression is 3*a9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divide by 2: 177144/2=88,572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the closed-form approach, let me verify the steps again. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, a1=4. The solution method is correct, and the particular solution was found correctly. So, the closed-form is accurate. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's solid. So, to recap, I computed each layer step by step, verified each computation, then found a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By iteratively computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value at each step. Finally, multiplying the ninth layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something? Because each layer seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let each layer be a term in a sequence, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier computation, Layer 1 was 4, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the sequence would be:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, a_9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer once more to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, everything checks out. I think I've got the right answer here. It's a pretty big number, but considering how many layers there are and the multiplicative factor of 3 each time, it makes sense that the number grows exponentially.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression in terms of a geometric series, each layer is effectively adding another power of 3. But since each term is multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, it's a bit more involved than a simple geometric series. But the closed-form formula we derived earlier using the recurrence relation gives us a neat way to compute the value without having to calculate each layer step by step, which could be especially useful if the number of layers were much larger.\n\nIn any case, whether by iterative computation or using the closed-form formula, the result is consistent. So, I'm pretty sure that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Actually, 29524 is 29,524. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but wait, a_1 is actually 4. Hmm, maybe my initial condition is different. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we found earlier. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression and applied the formula directly. But since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, I didn't think of the formula until later. But it's good to know that both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which results in 29,524, we multiply this by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term).

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is defined by a recurrence relation, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression or a formula that gives the nth term directly.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n ranges from 1 to 9. Then, the recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 * L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but L_1 is 1 + 3, so actually, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form L_n = A * r^n + B, where r is the common ratio and B is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C * 3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C * 3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C * 3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, the outermost layer is layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.

So, layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), and layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, I computed up to layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time you add 1 and multiply by 3. Let me denote the nth layer as L_n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 +1 = 3*4 +1=13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So now we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 -9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Then, divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nEach time, the term is 1 + 3*(...). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let's see if we can express this as a sum.\n\nBut maybe it's more straightforward to use the formula I derived. Since each L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, as above. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177,147. So, 177,147 -3 =177,144. Then, divided by 2 is 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the alternative method using the formula for the linear recurrence gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the recursive formula \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\), we find each subsequent layer. Finally, after computing the outermost layer, we multiply by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I get the same result as computing each layer step by step. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let x be the entire expression, then x = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which seems to go on infinitely, but in our case, it's finite with nine layers. However, since it's finite, the geometric series approach might not directly apply, but perhaps it's useful to see the pattern.\n\nWait, but in our case, it's finite, so the formula we derived using the recurrence relation is more appropriate. So, with n=9, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049, so a_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer).

Hmm, let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). This looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, actually, it's a recursive expression where each layer is defined by the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and it might be faster than computing each term step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me recall the method to solve such a recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the number of layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since in this problem there are only 9 layers, either method works. Either way, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we compute each layer step by step or apply the general formula to find the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recursive sequence.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: The nth term of the sequence can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For n=9 (since there are nine layers), compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, maybe I should try a different approach to confirm. Sometimes, when dealing with recursive expressions like this, there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. Let me recall the formula.\n\nFor a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so r=3, c=1, and a_0 = 1 (since Layer 1 is 4, which would correspond to a_1). Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, actually, Layer 1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so if I consider a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with our earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nFor n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula holds true for each layer, which gives me more confidence in the result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series. But since each term is nested, it's more like a geometric progression with each term built upon the previous one. The formula we derived earlier essentially captures that growth.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me check my earlier steps again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.

Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses. The expression ends with nine closing parentheses after the initial 3(...). Wait, let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, each followed by a 1+3(...). So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, I computed up to Layer 9, which was 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems correct.

Now, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.

So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 *3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all together: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because each time I do these multiplications, it's easy to make a mistake. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without manually computing each layer. Let me think about the pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if we can find a general formula for such a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3D = 1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in the general solution approach. Sometimes, when dealing with recurrence relations, especially for someone at my level, it's easy to get confused. Let me verify the formula for a few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches my earlier computation. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the result 88572, and by using a general formula derived from the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88572.

    "text": " Let me break it down. 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if I consider L_0, but since the problem starts at n=1, maybe I can find another way. Alternatively, I can solve the recurrence relation by iteration. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nWhich is what I got before. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the closed-form solution would be L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that formula. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result again. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly, but since I was unsure, I did the step-by-step computation first. Either way, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident now that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should just do 29524 * 3 directly. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, so that's consistent. So, the final answer would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute too many. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each set of parentheses adds a new layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) occurs: 1. 1+3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 1+3(...\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time there's a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of such instances.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the first innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3: Layer 1\n- Then moving out, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nEach time we have a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write the layers step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the initial 3. So, I think my initial computation was correct, with 9 layers leading up to Layer 9 = 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, in my initial calculation, I wrote 1,093, but earlier I thought 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. That's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 93*3=279. So, 3,000 + 279 = 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 841*3=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. As calculated earlier, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29,524 again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.

Correct.\n\nOkay, so my calculations seem consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula that represents this kind of nested expression, which might save time instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nThis expression is a form of a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps I can compute it iteratively as I did before, but maybe there's a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation of Layer 9 being 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent with my previous result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the formula approach also leads me to the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer and then verifying with a formula helped solidify the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = r*a_{n-1}, which has solution r^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on. This looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is Ln = 3*Ln-1, whose solution is Ln = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Lp. Plugging into the recurrence: Lp = 3*Lp + 1 => Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula, which might be faster for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, computing each layer step by step was manageable, though a bit time-consuming. Either way, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.

Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572 as the final answer. Let me see if that makes sense. Each layer seems to be growing by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of them.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I compute Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a*r^n + b, where r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have Layer 9, so:\n\nL(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, all correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), and L(9)=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using this method, each layer is computed step by step until the outermost layer is reached. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me recount how many layers I computed. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, I might consider that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., which matches what I did before. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, maybe we can find a particular solution. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...)\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, the next layer is 1+3(1+3)\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, each time we add a layer, we go one step out.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me check.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the 3: that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. So, how many opening parentheses are there after the first 3?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. So, that would mean 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, a_9 is indeed the outermost layer, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me try to write out the layers again.\n\nLet me consider the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: 1+3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 1+3*(4) = 13.\n\nThen, next layer: 1+3*(13) = 40.\n\nNext: 1+3*(40) = 121.\n\nNext: 1+3*(121) = 364.\n\nNext: 1+3*(364) = 1093.\n\nNext: 1+3*(1093) = 3280.\n\nNext: 1+3*(3280) = 9841.\n\nNext: 1+3*(9841) = 29524.\n\nWait, that's 8 layers after the innermost. Wait, no, starting from 1+3 as layer 1, then each step out adds another layer. So, from layer 1 to layer 9, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm the arithmetic for each layer again to be absolutely sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, as I did earlier, breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the arithmetic, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's a linear recursion where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursion. Suppose we have a sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of terms is small (only 9 layers), computing each step is manageable. But just for fun, let's see if we can find a formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, finding a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) -1/2 = (59049)/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So that's another way to confirm. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Let me write 29524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiply each digit by 3 from right to left:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the digits from right to left are 2,7,5,8,8.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 *3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the original expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing the 9th layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me check the multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when you have expressions like this, especially with repeated multiplication, there's a formula or pattern that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe that's a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. So, starting from L_1 = 4, as we did earlier, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers we computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. However, if there were more layers, the recurrence relation approach would be much more efficient. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(\u2026))).

Maybe a geometric series or something? Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression: each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1+3=4.\n\nThen a_2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13\n\na3=1+3*a2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a9=1 +3*a8=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r-3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 +3*B => B -3B=1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4.\n\nWait, a1=4.

Let me compute that again: 3*20,000=60,000; 3*9,000=27,000; 3*500=1,500; 3*24=72. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. So yes, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. Let me check if I missed any layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? So starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time wrapping the previous result. So, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, the outermost Layer is Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29,524=88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when I compute these nested expressions, I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers to be sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent opening parenthesis is part of the nested expression. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time you have \"1+3(\" until the ninth layer. Wait, actually, the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and then each time you have another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then moving out, the next is (1+3(...))\n3. Each time you move out, you add another layer.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time you have a ( after a 3, except the very first one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3, we have:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3)\n\nWait, that's nine opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that means there are nine layers, each starting with 1+3(...). So, each Layer from 1 to 9 corresponds to each of these. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the outermost one, and then I multiplied by 3, which is correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let's see:\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (c=1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nWe can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which reinforces that my initial computation was correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n4. Cross-verify using a recurrence relation approach to ensure the result is accurate.\n\nThis makes me confident that 88,572 is indeed the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.

Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, we're computing up to a_9, and then multiplying by 3. Let me compute this sequence up to a_9: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Since each term is a linear function of the previous term, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. When n=1, a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step. That's a good check and confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(1 - a)), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the general solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*( (a^n - 1)/(a - 1) ). Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, the solution can be expressed as L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). Let me confirm that. Let's see, if I have L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, then the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging L_p into the equation: L_p = a*L_p + b => L_p - a*L_p = b => L_p*(1 - a) = b => L_p = b/(1 - a). Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + b/(1 - a). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say L_0 is the value when n=0, but in our case, L_1 is the first layer, so perhaps n starts at 1. Wait, actually, in our problem, L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe n starts at 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. So, for n >= 1, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Then, using the general solution formula: L_n = C*3^n + (1)/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we calculated earlier. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct again. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is L_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is L_9, which is the 9th layer. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently. I think that's solid.

Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next digit: 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, because if I have to compute nine layers each time, it's time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this expression. The expression is of the form: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, we can solve it iteratively. Alternatively, we can express it as a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 = 1 + 3^1 *1\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but actually, let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nSo, yes, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers. So, the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we get the same result, which confirms that our initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, since we have nine layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, and then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, another way to express the final result is (3^{11} -3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the result is consistent.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then recognized a pattern that allowed me to use a formula for a geometric series, verified the formula with the initial terms, applied it to find the result, and then cross-checked using an alternative expression. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outwards. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), which forms a geometric series. The closed-form formula for the nth term is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this for nine layers and multiplying by 3, we find the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but wait, let me recall the exact formula. Alternatively, since it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which would be faster for larger numbers of layers. But since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the multiplication step. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 =6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7. 5 * 3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 *3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I'm solid here. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Each layer's value is correct, so multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way to confirm. Alternatively, I could recognize that this is a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's more of a repeated multiplication. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This recursive relation might be modeled as a geometric sequence, but since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, the formula works for the first few layers. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've approached this correctly, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit time-consuming, especially with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I was worried I might have missed a layer or miscalculated one of the multiplications, but going through each step carefully and then verifying with the formula helped solidify that the answer is correct. So, yeah, 88572 is the result of computing that entire expression.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. This is a recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me break it down. 29524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up each part multiplied by 3: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of parentheses. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) before the final multiplication by 3. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). How many layers are there? Let me see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write the expression with numbers: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses before we reach the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, actually, each 1+3(...) is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1+3(...) is another layer. So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3: layer 1. Then, moving out, we have 1+3*(layer1): layer 2. Then, 1+3*(layer2): layer3. Continuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time we have another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3 (innermost) \u2013 layer1\n2. 1+3*(layer1) \u2013 layer2\n3. 1+3*(layer2) \u2013 layer3\n4. 1+3*(layer3) \u2013 layer4\n5. 1+3*(layer4) \u2013 layer5\n6. 1+3*(layer5) \u2013 layer6\n7. 1+3*(layer6) \u2013 layer7\n8. 1+3*(layer7) \u2013 layer8\n9. 1+3*(layer8) \u2013 layer9\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, I think I had it right earlier. So, layer1 is 1+3=4, layer2=1+3*4=13, layer3=1+3*13=40, layer4=1+3*40=121, layer5=1+3*121=364, layer6=1+3*364=1093, layer7=1+3*1093=3280, layer8=1+3*3280=9841, layer9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the final result is 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 in another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me set b_n = a_n + c, then b_n = 3*b_{n-1}. This is a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Then, a_n = b_n - c. Let's find c such that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting into the equation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => b_n - c = 1 + 3*(b_{n-1} - c) => b_n - c = 1 + 3*b_{n-1} - 3c => b_n = 1 - 2c + 3*b_{n-1}. But we also have b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, so setting them equal: 3*b_{n-1} = 1 - 2c + 3*b_{n-1} => 0 = 1 - 2c => c = 1/2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2, where b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Now, b_1 = a_1 + c = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1}. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Alternatively, since 9 = 3^2, we can write a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me break it down. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, but 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. Wait, no, 30,000 - 29524 = 476. So, 29524 = 30,000 - 476. Therefore, 3*29524 = 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that subtraction: 90,000 - 1,428. 90,000 minus 1,000 is 89,000. Then, minus 428 more: 89,000 - 428 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3 * 29524 directly: 29,524 * 3.

So Layer 6: 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 +9=3,279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.

I think I did that right. But let me try another approach just to be sure. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use to compute this without calculating each layer individually. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Suppose I let x_n represent the nth layer. So, x_1 = 1 + 3, x_2 = 1 + 3x_1, and so on up to x_9. Then, each x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say x_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x_n = x_n^{(h)} + x_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, x_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final result is 3 * x_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that using the formula. Since x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3 * x_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10} is 59049, so 3^{11} is 177147.\n\nThus, 3 * x_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYep, same result. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure of the expression.\n\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n3. Alternatively, model the expression using a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution.\n\n4. Verify the result by computing each layer step by step and then multiplying by 3.\n\nBoth methods led me to the same answer, so I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me break it down. 3 * 29,524. 3 * 20,000 = 60,000. 3 * 9,000 = 27,000. 3 * 500 = 1,500. 3 * 24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. It's easy to get lost in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, actually, let me think again. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + d*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, more precisely, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using both methods, working step by step from the inside out and using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524.

Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it might make sense.
