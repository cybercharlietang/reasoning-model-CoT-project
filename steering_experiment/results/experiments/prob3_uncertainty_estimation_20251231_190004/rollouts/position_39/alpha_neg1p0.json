    "text": " 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 72 is 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279? Let me check: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Yes, correct. So 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Yes, correct. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. So 29,523 +1=29,524. Correct.) Now, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 *3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense because each layer is growing exponentially, so the numbers get large quickly. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we have a recursive relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as computed earlier. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct again. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the solution is correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the expression had more layers. But since it only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, though it was time-consuming. I think I did everything correctly, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, we continue until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 *3=88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 by breaking it down: 29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. Let's verify a couple of layers. For example, Layer3:1 +3*Layer2=1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Then, multiplying Layer9 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that again more carefully:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88,572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). How many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of times 1 + 3 appears:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each time you add another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around. So, in total, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3, that gives 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try computing each layer again step by step, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1) = 4. Wait, actually, starting from a(0) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a(1) = 1 + 3*a(0) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches my earlier calculations. So, the nth term is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(0) = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be a(n) = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant. Let's assume a particular solution is A. Then, A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a(0) = 4: 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = C - 1/2 \u2192 C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, a(n) = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a(n) = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. So, a(9) = (9*3^9 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^9 is 19,683. So, 9*19,683 = 177,147. Then, 177,147 - 1 = 177,146. Divided by 2: 177,146 / 2 = 88,573. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, that's concerning. Did I make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach?\n\nWait, let me check the initial condition again. When n = 0, a(0) = 4. Using the formula: a(0) = (9*3^0 - 1)/2 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. Then, for n = 1: a(1) = (9*3^1 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. Similarly, n=2: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a(9) = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = (9*19,683 -1)/2. Let me compute 9*19,683: 19,683 * 9: 19,683 * 10 = 196,830; subtract 19,683: 196,830 - 19,683 = 177,147. So, 177,147 - 1 = 177,146. Divided by 2: 177,146 / 2 = 88,573. Wait, but earlier I calculated the total as 88,572, which is 88,573 - 1. Hmm, that suggests a discrepancy. So, which one is correct? Let me see. If I use the recurrence relation approach, which seems more formulaic, I get 88,573, but when I computed step by step, I got 88,572. So, there must be an error in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1 + 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first ( after 3 is the start of the first layer. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count them: Starting after 3, the first ( is layer 1, then another ( is layer 2, and so on until the ninth (, which is layer 9. So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, in the recurrence relation, n = 9. Therefore, a(9) = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = 88,573. But when I computed step by step, I got 29,524 for Layer 9, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check Layer 9 again. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. But according to the recurrence relation, a(9) = (9*3^9 -1)/2 = (9*19,683 -1)/2 = (177,147 -1)/2 = 177,146/2 = 88,573. So, there's a discrepancy of 1 between the two methods. That suggests that I might have misapplied the recurrence relation. Let me think about this.\n\nWait, in the recurrence relation, a(n) represents the value of the nth layer. But in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total is 3*a(9). So, if a(9) = 88,573, then 3*a(9) would be 265,719, which is way too high. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I confused the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the recurrence relation, a(n) is the value of the nth layer, which is 1 + 3*a(n-1). So, in the original problem, the innermost layer is a(1) = 4, then a(2) = 13, up to a(9) = 29,524. So, the outermost expression is 3*a(9), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches my step-by-step calculation. But according to the formula, a(n) = (9*3^n -1)/2. For n=9, that gives a(9) = (9*19,683 -1)/2 = 88,573, which is one more than my step-by-step result. So, there must be an error in the formula's application.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a(n) where n starts at 0, whereas my layers start at 1. Let me check. If a(0) = 4, then a(1) = 13, a(2)=40, etc. So, in the formula, a(n) = (9*3^n -1)/2. So, for n=0, a(0)= (9*1 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=1, a(1)= (9*3 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=2, (9*9 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, for n=9, a(9)= (9*3^9 -1)/2= (9*19,683 -1)/2= (177,147 -1)/2=177,146/2=88,573. But according to my step-by-step, a(9)=29,524. Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps the formula is not a(n) = (9*3^n -1)/2, but something else. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(0) = 4. The solution to this recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is a(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A =1 \u2192 A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a(0)=4: 4 = C*3^0 -1/2 \u2192 4 = C -1/2 \u2192 C=4 +1/2=9/2. Thus, a(n)= (9/2)*3^n -1/2= (9*3^n -1)/2. So, that's correct. So, for n=9, a(9)= (9*3^9 -1)/2=88,573. But in my step-by-step, I got a(9)=29,524, which is exactly 88,573 divided by 3. Wait, no, 88,573 divided by 3 is approximately 29,524.333... Hmm, so perhaps the formula gives a(n) as the value after multiplying by 3? Wait, no, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*a(9). So, if a(9)=88,573, then 3*a(9)=265,719, which is way too big. That can't be right because my step-by-step gave 88,572, which is close to 88,573. So, perhaps the formula is giving a(n) as the value after multiplying by 3? That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think differently. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. But in this case, S = 3*(1 + S/3). Wait, because each time you have 1 + 3*(inner expression), and if the inner expression is similar to S, then perhaps S = 3*(1 + S/3). Let me try that.\n\nLet S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Then, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4, but as we go outward, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I consider the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and the inner part is similar to S/3, because S = 3*(...). So, perhaps S = 3*(1 + (S)/3). Let me write that equation: S = 3*(1 + S/3) \u2192 S = 3 + S \u2192 Which implies 0 = 3, which is impossible. Hmm, that can't be right. So, maybe my assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the expression isn't S = 3*(1 + S/3), but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define S as the entire expression without the outermost 3. Let me try that. Let me define S as the inner expression: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Then, the original expression is 3*S. Now, S can be written as 1 + 3*(S'), where S' is another similar expression. But since the expression is finite, with 9 layers, perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, another approach: Each layer is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1)=4. So, the sequence is a(1)=4, a(2)=13, a(3)=40, etc., up to a(9)=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a(9)=88,572, which matches my step-by-step calculation. So, the formula a(n) = (9*3^n -1)/2 must be giving a different value because perhaps it's counting the layers differently. Wait, let me compute a(9) using the formula: a(9)= (9*3^9 -1)/2= (9*19,683 -1)/2= (177,147 -1)/2=177,146/2=88,573. But according to my step-by-step, a(9)=29,524, which is exactly 88,573 divided by 3. So, perhaps the formula is giving the value of 3*a(n). Let me check: If a(n) = (9*3^n -1)/2, then 3*a(n)= (27*3^n -3)/2. For n=9: 27*19,683=531,441; 531,441 -3=531,438; 531,438/2=265,719, which is way too big. So, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the expression is finite, with 9 layers, whereas the formula assumes an infinite series. Wait, but the formula was derived for the finite case as well, because the recurrence relation is valid for any n. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me compute a(9) using the formula and the step-by-step method and see where I went wrong.\n\nUsing the formula: a(n)= (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: a(1)= (9*3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=2: (9*9 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=3: (9*27 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=4: (9*81 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=5: (9*243 -1)/2=2,187-1=2,186/2=1,093. Correct.\n\nn=6: (9*729 -1)/2=6,561-1=6,560/2=3,280. Correct.\n\nn=7: (9*2,187 -1)/2=19,683-1=19,682/2=9,841. Correct.\n\nn=8: (9*6,561 -1)/2=59,049-1=59,048/2=29,524. Correct.\n\nn=9: (9*19,683 -1)/2=177,147-1=177,146/2=88,573.\n\nWait a minute! So, a(8)=29,524, which is the value I got for Layer 9 in my step-by-step. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. In other words, in the formula, a(n) corresponds to the (n+1)th layer in my step-by-step. Because when n=8, a(8)=29,524, which is Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a(8)=3*29,524=88,572, which matches my step-by-step result. So, the formula gives a(n) as the value for the (n+1)th layer in my counting. Therefore, to get the value for Layer 9, I need a(8) from the formula, which is 29,524, then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nFinally, multiply the ninth layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Actually, 29524 * 3 can be computed as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it together: 7 7 8 5 2, so 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524. Adding these: 59048 + 29524. Let's add digit by digit: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +2 +1=8. So 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final result is 88572.

Hmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). But when I labeled them from Layer 1 to Layer 9, starting from the innermost, that should be correct. Let me count the number of parentheses to confirm. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times the pattern 1 + 3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Wait, but when I computed earlier, I only went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, perhaps that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. Each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.

Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around the previous one, up to Layer 9.

Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572, same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again, because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, so 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, maybe I should compute it directly. Let's do 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a layer. So starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is Layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, that would be 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since the number of layers isn't too large, step-by-step computation seems manageable. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is Layer 3. So, this seems to fit. So, if I can compute a_9, then multiply by 3, I get the final result. Alternatively, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Because for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4, the solution is a_n = (3^{n} + 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. Let's compute a few terms using the formula. For n=1: (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 +1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Hmm, but a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation of Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Wait, but that's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to confirm. Let's take a_4: According to the formula, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer.

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Alternatively, recognizing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from a_1=4, each a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, it's 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, yes, that's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, that feels a bit high. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" starting from the innermost. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each time you have a 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because I see that the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, from Layer1 to Layer9, that's 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem using a recursive formula or recognizing a pattern that could simplify the computation. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, L(1)=4, L(2)=1+3*4=13, L(3)=1+3*13=40, and so on, up to L(9). Then, the total expression is 3*L(9). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence relation into the general solution:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nAssume L(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, L(n-1) = A*3^(n-1) + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B\nSimplify the right side: 3*A*3^(n-1) = A*3^n, so:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nL(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if that formula works for n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nCompute L(n) for n=1 to 9:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4\nn=2: (27 -1)/2=13\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=40\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=121\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=364\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=1093\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=3280\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=9841\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but I think the recurrence approach worked well here.\n\nSo, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus three times the next layer, starting from 1+3=4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the calculations seem consistent. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer (Layer 9), we multiply by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

But let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n, which could save time and reduce errors.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, using this formula, we can compute a_9 directly.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. To find D, set a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*previous +1. So, after 9 layers, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2, then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. I think that's all I can do here. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward and using a recurrence relation, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation:** Let a_n represent the value at the nth layer. The relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence:** The general solution for a_n is found to be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9:** Plugging n=9 into the formula gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9524 = 28572. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from the top, it's 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. As before, 29524*3. Let me compute it again: 29524*3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 88572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, I computed each layer correctly, and the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems right, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something. Let me try to model it. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from the inside out. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, yes, this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}. Let me see. The outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*L_8). But L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2, so 3*(1 + 3*(3^9 -1)/2). Let me compute that: 3*(1 + (3*(3^9 -1))/2) = 3*(1 + (3^{10} -3)/2) = 3*( (2 + 3^{10} -3)/2 ) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3*(3^{10} -1))/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without computing each layer. That's much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. But it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, I can solve the problem efficiently. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let's go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out, so I think my final answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting from a(1) = 4. Then, the nth term would be a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). If I expand this, it's similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a(n). Let's write down the first few terms: a(1) = 4 a(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. In general, for a recurrence relation of the form a(n) = k*a(n-1) + c, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation here is a(n) = 3*a(n-1), whose solution is a(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 \u21d2 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a(9) =3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer.

So, each step seems correct, and the final result is 88,572. I don't see any errors in my calculations. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable.

    "text": " 3*20000 = 60000 3*9000 = 27000 3*500 = 1500 3*24 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me quickly go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that each layer is straightforward, maybe computing each step is the simplest way. Another approach could be to recognize that each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, we can see that this is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly and then apply the formula. Since 3^{10}=59049, as above, so (59049 -1)/2=29524, then times 3 is 88572. Either way, it's consistent. So, I think I've verified it sufficiently. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if there's a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the values we computed:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Correct.\n\nSo, the layers seem to be correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, maybe that's the correct answer after all. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive formula. It looks like a geometric series, but maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. We have L_1 = 4, so:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B\n\nSimilarly, for L_2 = 13:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A = 3/2 into the first equation:\n\n4 = (3/2)*3 + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The problem is 3*(...), which is 3*L_9. But in the formula, L_n is already 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so each L_n is the term inside the 3*(...) at each level. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9). Therefore, the total is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see:\n\nEach L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach term inside the parentheses is 1 + 3*(...), which can be seen as a sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.

    "text": " 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Hmm, wait, that seems like a big number, but considering how many layers there are, maybe it's correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems to multiply the previous result by 3 and add 1. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me find the steady-state solution. Let\u2019s assume a steady state where a_n = a_{n-1} = S. Then S = 1 + 3S => S - 3S = 1 => -2S = 1 => S = -1/2. Hmm, that seems odd because all our terms are positive. Maybe this approach isn't the best here, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. So, the general solution can be written as a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is the particular solution. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B => Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, our initial condition is a_1=4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result each time. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the number of layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the left, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). Each time, the 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3s after the first one. Hmm, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n3. Then moving out, each 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied by something:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this Layer 1.\n2. The next layer is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 2.\n3. Then (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 3.\n4. Then (1 + 3*40) = 121. Layer 4.\n5. Then (1 + 3*121) = 364. Layer 5.\n6. Then (1 + 3*364) = 1093. Layer 6.\n7. Then (1 + 3*1093) = 3280. Layer 7.\n8. Then (1 + 3*3280) = 9841. Layer 8.\n9. Then (1 + 3*9841) = 29524. Layer 9.\n10. Finally, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the outermost is 3 times that. So my initial calculation was correct. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try computing each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some recursive formula. Let me see if there's another way to approach it.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThis seems to follow the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, and as I solved earlier, the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, using that, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I double-checked each step, used two different methods (direct computation and recurrence relation), and both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might help me compute it without going through each layer step by step. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the closed-form formula gives me the same results as computing each layer step by step. So, using the formula, the innermost expression is a_1 = 4, and each layer outwards is a_2, a_3, ..., a_9 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier. To ensure that I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me compute 3*29524 again. Breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with such a lengthy computation. So, to recap, I broke down the problem by computing each nested layer step by step, then cross-verified using a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, and finally double-checked the multiplication. All methods led me to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of multiplications and additions.

    "text": " 3 * 29000 = 87000, 3 * 524 = 1572, so adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000+279=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So when I computed Layer 9, that was the innermost part, right? Wait no, actually, when I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, which was 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer wrapped around that. So, Layer 9 would actually be the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, yes, that's correct. So, the total is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is closed eventually. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the first parenthesis after 3 is (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ... (1 + 3(...\n3. ... (1 + 3(...\n4. ... (1 + 3(...\n5. ... (1 + 3(...\n6. ... (1 + 3(...\n7. ... (1 + 3(...\n8. ... (1 + 3(...\n9. ... (1 + 3(...\n10. ... (1 + 3))))))))) Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, I can think that each time I have a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1 + 3*(...): Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n- Then 1 + 3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n- Then 1 + 3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n- And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total. So, my earlier calculation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say I have a similar expression but with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, computing directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Now, using my layer method: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, total expression: 3*13 = 39. Correct. So, the method works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying it to the original problem with 9 layers should also work. So, unless I made an arithmetic mistake in one of the layers, the answer should be correct. Let me verify the arithmetic in each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll layers check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_9 = 29524, as I calculated before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that to see if it gives the same result. 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. That's probably more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using a recurrence relation approach, we determine that the value of the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations:\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the recurrence relation approach backs up the step-by-step calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the innermost term is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, let's find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous part of the recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is nonhomogeneous. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. This confirms my previous result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've considered this problem thoroughly, checked my work using two different methods, and both lead me to the same conclusion. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is defined as 1 plus three times the previous term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but given the time, step-by-step computation seems manageable and less error-prone for me. Another way is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the inner layer. So, each time, you're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Wait, that actually reminds me of the formula for a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me think about it. If I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine terms, it's easier to compute each step as I did before. However, if I were to find a closed-form formula, I could solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 =4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as before. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n3. Continue this process until reaching the outermost layer, which results in 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Sometimes, when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step, which would throw off all the subsequent ones. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 (correct)\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think my final answer is correct. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is following a pattern that can be expressed as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me explore that approach as well to confirm my answer.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a recursive relation. To solve this recurrence, I can write it as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as repeatedly applying the operation 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to building a number in base 3 or something, but I think the recursive approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially adding another digit in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Maybe not, since each step is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is different from digit placement.\n\nIn any case, having computed each layer step by step and confirmed using the recursive formula, I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize that each layer can be computed step by step.\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost one, moving outward.\n3. Alternatively, model the recurrence relation and solve it to find a closed-form expression for each layer.\n4. Compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 as per the original expression.\n5. Verify the calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also emphasized the importance of careful step-by-step computation and verification to avoid errors, especially with multiple layers involved.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost outwards. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way out. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, in this case, a is 3, and b is 1. But our initial term is L_1 = 4, not L_0. Let me adjust the indices. Let me define L_0 as the innermost term, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_0 = 4. So, using the formula for linear recurrence relations, the solution would be L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, let me check that formula again. The standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * (L_0 + b/(a - 1)) - b/(a - 1). Alternatively, sometimes written as L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Let me confirm. For our case, a = 3, b = 1. So, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Plugging in L_0 = 4, we get L_n = 3^n *4 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: L_1 = 3^1*4 + (3^1 -1)/2 = 12 + (3 -1)/2 = 12 + 1 = 13. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = 3^2*4 + (9 -1)/2 = 36 + 4 = 40. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = 3^3*4 + (27 -1)/2 = 108 + 13 = 121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = 3^9 *4 + (3^9 -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, 3^9 = 19683. Therefore, L_9 = 19683*4 + (19683 -1)/2. Let's compute each part: 19683*4: 19683*2=39366, so 39366*2=78732. Then, (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. So, L_9 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573. Wait, hold on, that's different from my earlier result of 29524. Wait, no, actually, in my initial computation, I stopped at Layer 9 as 29524, but according to this formula, L_9 is 88573. But that can't be, because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, in my initial approach, I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*previous, starting from 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the formula, L_9 is 88573. Wait, so there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the initial computation. Let me check where I went wrong. Let's go back to the formula. The formula was L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^n -1)/2. With L_0 = 4, n=9: L_9 = 3^9 *4 + (3^9 -1)/2 = 19683*4 + (19683 -1)/2. Let's compute each term again: 19683*4: 19683*4. Let's compute 19683*4: 19683*2=39366, so 39366*2=78732. Correct. (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. So, L_9 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573. But in my initial step-by-step computation, I had Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, there's a difference of 1. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I miscounted the layers or misapplied the formula. Let me check my initial computation again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the formula, L_9 is 88573. So, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again. The formula is for L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_0 = 4. So, the general solution is L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^n -1)/2. But in my initial computation, L_9 is 29524, which is equal to 3^9 * L_0 + ... Wait, no, in the formula, L_n is 3^n * L_0 + (3^n -1)/2. So, plugging n=9, L_9 = 3^9 *4 + (3^9 -1)/2 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573. But in my initial computation, Layer 9 is 29524. That suggests that my initial computation is wrong, because according to the formula, L_9 should be 88573, not 29524. Wait, but in my step-by-step, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. But according to the formula, L_8 should be 9841, which is correct, because in my step-by-step, Layer 8 is 9841. Then, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, which is correct. So, why does the formula give L_9 as 88573? Wait, perhaps the formula is giving the total expression, not just Layer 9. Because in the formula, L_n is the nth term, which in my initial computation is Layer n. But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if L_9 = 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the formula, L_9 = 88573, which is one more than that. So, perhaps the formula is actually giving the total expression, not Layer 9. Let me think again. If I define L_n as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, then the total expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps the formula is giving L_n as 3^n *4 + (3^n -1)/2, which for n=9 is 88573, but that would mean that the total expression is 3*L_9, which would be 3*88573 = 265719, which is way too big. That can't be right. So, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me try to redefine the problem. Let me consider that the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression becomes Layer 9, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the formula, L_9 = 3^9 *4 + (3^9 -1)/2 = 78732 + 9841 = 88573. So, that's off by one. Wait, perhaps the formula is giving the total expression, not just Layer 9. Let me see: If I consider the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, then E = 3*L_9. But according to the formula, L_9 = 88573, so E = 3*88573 = 265719. But that's inconsistent with my initial computation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is giving E = L_9, but that would mean E = 88573, which is inconsistent with my initial computation of E = 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me try to derive the formula correctly. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_0 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation properly. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's substitute the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_0 = 4: 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. Let me check this with n=0: L_0 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=2: (9*9 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the correct formula is L_n = (9*3^n -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (9*3^9 -1)/2. Compute 3^9=19683. So, 9*19683=177147. Then, 177147 -1=177146. Divide by 2: 177146/2=88573. So, L_9=88573. But wait, in my initial computation, I had Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But according to the formula, L_9=88573, which is the total expression. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong. Because the formula is giving L_n as the total expression, not just the innermost layer. Wait, let me clarify. The formula was derived for L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_0=4. So, L_1=13, L_2=40, etc., up to L_9=88573. But in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, leading to 88572. So, why is there a discrepancy? It seems that I have a misunderstanding here. Let me redefine the problem. Let me define E_n as the expression after n layers, starting from the innermost. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 =4. E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1=13. E_3=1+3*E_2=40, etc., up to E_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9=88572. But according to the formula, L_n=E_n=(9*3^n -1)/2. For n=9, L_9=88573, which is different from E_9=29524. So, it seems that the formula is giving a different result. Therefore, I must have misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for a different starting point. Let me try to see: If I define E_n as the expression after n layers, starting from E_1=4, then E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}, with E_1=4. Then, the general solution is E_n= (9*3^n -1)/2. So, for n=1: (9*3 -1)/2=26/2=13, which is E_2. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, E_1=4, which should correspond to n=1 in the formula. But (9*3^1 -1)/2=26/2=13=E_2. So, the formula gives E_n for n starting at 1 as E_2. That suggests that the formula is shifted. So, perhaps E_n= (9*3^{n} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. But in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, E_9= (9*3^9 -1)/2= (9*19683 -1)/2= (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. But in my initial computation, E_9=29524, which is 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*E_9=88572. So, according to the formula, E_9=88573, but according to my step-by-step, E_9=29524. There's a clear inconsistency here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in defining the problem for the formula. Let me try to redefine it correctly. Let me consider that the innermost expression is E_1=1+3=4. Then, E_2=1+3*E_1=13. E_3=1+3*E_2=40. So, each E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}. So, the general solution for E_n is E_n= (9*3^{n} -1)/2. So, for n=1, E_1=(9*3 -1)/2=26/2=13, but wait, E_1 is supposed to be 4. Therefore, the formula is giving E_2=13, E_3=40, etc. So, in other words, the formula gives E_n where n is the number of layers starting from the second layer. Therefore, to get E_9, which is the ninth layer, we need to set n=9 in the formula, which would correspond to E_9= (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. But in my step-by-step, E_9=29524. Therefore, the formula must be correct, and my step-by-step must be wrong. Let me check my step-by-step again. Starting from E_1=4. E_2=1 +3*4=13. E_3=1 +3*13=40. E_4=1 +3*40=121. E_5=1 +3*121=364. E_6=1 +3*364=1093. E_7=1 +3*1093=3280. E_8=1 +3*3280=9841. E_9=1 +3*9841=29524. So, E_9=29524. But according to the formula, E_9=88573. So, there's a problem here. Wait, perhaps the formula is for the total expression, not just the innermost layer. Let me see: If the entire expression is E=3*E_9, where E_9=29524, then E=88572. But according to the formula, E_n=88573, which is one more than that. Wait, perhaps the formula is for the total expression, which is E=3*E_9. Let me check: If E=3*E_9, and E_9=29524, then E=88572. But according to the formula, E= (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. So, 88573 vs 88572. They are off by one. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the step-by-step. Let me check the formula again. The general solution for E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}, E_1=4, is E_n= (9*3^{n} -1)/2. Let me test n=1: E_1=(9*3 -1)/2=26/2=13, but E_1 is supposed to be 4. So, the formula is not matching for n=1. Therefore, perhaps the formula is for a different initial condition. Let me redefine the problem. Let me consider that the innermost expression is E_0=1+3=4. Then, E_1=1 +3*E_0=13. E_2=1 +3*E_1=40, etc. So, E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}, with E_0=4. Then, the general solution is E_n= (9*3^{n} -1)/2. Let's test n=0: E_0= (9*1 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=1: (9*3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=2: (9*9 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works if we start counting from E_0=4. Therefore, in our problem, the innermost expression is E_0=4, and we have 9 layers, so E_9= (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9=3*88573=265719. But wait, that can't be, because in my step-by-step, I computed E_9=29524, leading to 3*29524=88572. So, there's a contradiction here. I must have misapplied the formula. Let me clarify: The formula gives E_n= (9*3^n -1)/2, where E_n is the value after n layers, starting from E_0=4. Therefore, in our problem, the innermost expression is E_0=4, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3*E_9. Therefore, E_9= (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. Therefore, the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But in my step-by-step, I computed E_9=29524, leading to 3*29524=88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute E_9 manually using the formula and see. Compute E_9= (9*3^9 -1)/2. 3^9=19683. 9*19683=177147. 177147 -1=177146. 177146/2=88573. So, E_9=88573. Therefore, the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But in my step-by-step, I got 88572. So, clearly, I must have misapplied the formula. Wait, no, in my step-by-step, I computed E_9=29524, which is the value after 9 layers, starting from E_0=4. But according to the formula, E_9=88573. Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers in my step-by-step. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count them: 3( ... ) where ... is 1+3(...). Each 1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3 terms. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: 1. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9, because after the first 3, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, E_9=88573, and the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But in my initial step-by-step, I computed E_9=29524, leading to 88572. Therefore, my initial approach was wrong because I misapplied the formula. The correct approach is to recognize that the entire expression is 3*E_9, where E_9= (9*3^9 -1)/2=88573. Therefore, the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But that contradicts my initial computation. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step. Let me check my step-by-step again. Starting from the innermost: E_0=1+3=4. E_1=1 +3*4=13. E_2=1 +3*13=40. E_3=1 +3*40=121. E_4=1 +3*121=364. E_5=1 +3*364=1093. E_6=1 +3*1093=3280. E_7=1 +3*3280=9841. E_8=1 +3*9841=29524. E_9=1 +3*29524=88573. Wait, hold on! I think I see the mistake. In my initial step-by-step, I stopped at E_9=29524, but according to the formula, E_9=88573. So, in my step-by-step, I was computing E_8=29524, and then stopped, thinking that was E_9. But actually, E_9=1 +3*E_8=1 +3*29524=88573. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I stopped one layer too early. Therefore, the correct value of E_9 is 88573, and the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But wait, that can't be, because in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...), which is 3*E_9. So, if E_9=88573, then the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But that seems too large, and I must have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then, each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, E_9=88573, and the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But that seems inconsistent with my initial step-by-step. Let me try to compute E_9 manually by continuing my step-by-step beyond E_8=29524. So, E_8=29524. Then, E_9=1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573. Correct. Therefore, the total expression is 3*88573=265719. But wait, that contradicts my initial step-by-step where I thought E_9=29524. Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers. Let me see: The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9. Therefore, there are 9 layers. Therefore, E_9=88573, and the total expression is 3*88573=265719. Therefore, the correct answer is 265719. But that contradicts my initial step-by-step where I thought the answer was 88572. Therefore, I must have misapplied the formula or miscounted the layers. Let me try to compute the expression step by step correctly, counting 9 layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. Wait, but according to the formula, E_9=88573. So, which one is correct? Let me compute E_9 manually. If I have 9 layers, starting from E_0=4, then E_1=13, E_2=40, E_3=121, E_4=364, E_5=1093, E_6=3280, E_7=9841, E_8=29524, E_9=88573. Therefore, E_9=88573. Therefore, the total expression is 3*E_9=265719. But in my initial step-by-step, I computed E_9=29524, which is E_8. Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 layers, so E_9=88573, leading to the total expression=265719. Therefore, the correct answer is 265719. But that contradicts my initial step-by-step. Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers in the original expression. Let me count the number of layers in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3( ... ) 2. 1+3( ... ) 3. 1+3( ... ) 4. 1+3( ... ) 5. 1+3( ... ) 6. 1+3( ... ) 7. 1+3( ... ) 8. 1+3( ... ) 9. 1+3( ... ) 10. 1+3(...))))) Wait, no, that's not right. The expression is 3 followed by 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, E_9=88573, and the total expression is 3*88573=265719. Therefore, the correct answer is 265719. But in my initial step-by-step, I computed E_9=29524, which is E_8. Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers. Therefore, the correct answer is 265719. However, I'm confused because the initial step-by-step suggests 88572, but the formula suggests 265719. I need to resolve this discrepancy. Let me try to compute the expression step by step again, carefully counting the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +"

Let me double-check my computations because sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Let me verify 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it out: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each \"1+\" is followed by another layer. Wait, let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the ninth one. So, in total, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, which is correct. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, up to Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, substituting the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^{n} + 3B +1. So, left-hand side is A*3^{n} + B, right-hand side is A*3^{n} + 3B +1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B +1. Then, B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1=4. So, L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we can compute it as L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...))). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, if I expand the expression, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, but in our case, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which is similar but not exactly a geometric series. Wait, actually, the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1 is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, which we've already solved. But maybe I can express it in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to expand the layers. For example, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 + 3 + 9 =13. Layer 3:1 + 3*(1 + 3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, Layer 3 is 1 +3*(Layer 2)=1 +3*13=40. So, Layer 3 isn't the sum up to 3^3, but rather 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)). So, each layer adds another 3^{n} term. Let me see: Layer 1: 1 +3=4= (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Layer 2:1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13= (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Layer3:1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3 +9 +27=40= (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. So, indeed, Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the formula holds. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, I think that's solid. Just to make sure, I can compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that's the answer. I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Let me compute this another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, carryover 7. 52 * 3 = 156 + 7 = 163, carryover 16. 95 * 3 = 285 + 16 = 301, carryover 30. 29 * 3 = 87 + 30 = 117. So, writing it down: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, I notice that each term is growing exponentially. Maybe it's a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the numbers. Looking at Layer n, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 4\nLayer 2: 13 = 4*3 + 1\nLayer 3: 40 = 13*3 + 1\nLayer 4: 121 = 40*3 + 1\nLayer 5: 364 = 121*3 + 1\nLayer 6: 1093 = 364*3 + 1\nLayer 7: 3280 = 1093*3 + 1\nLayer 8: 9841 = 3280*3 + 1\nLayer 9: 29524 = 9841*3 + 1\n\nSo, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. I remember that for such linear recurrence relations, there's a formula to find the nth term without computing each step. The standard approach is to solve the recurrence relation. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so its value is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that:\n\n3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049; 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the final multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, double-checked my work, and even found a formula to confirm the result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.

Each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're adding 3 times a number that's already quite large. So, the numbers get big very quickly.

    "text": " 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9524 = 28572. Wait, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because sometimes when you're multiplying large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can use a different approach. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can see that each a_n is defined recursively. Let me compute a few terms to see if I can find a pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's up to a_9, which is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572 as before. Hmm, but maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nSimilarly, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying each step and using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...), each time a new (1+3(...). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: Each \"1+3\" is followed by a closing parenthesis except the last one. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, then 1+3(...), each time another 1+3(...). So how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1+3(...). So if I have 1+3, that's the innermost. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), each time adding another layer. So that would mean 9 layers, right? So my initial counting was correct: Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences.

Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, but the innermost is just 1+3 without another layer. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression with indices:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., Ln, where n is the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until Ln.\n\nIn the original problem, how many such layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each time, it's a new layer. So:\n\nAfter the first 3*(, there's a 1 + 3*(...). Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let's count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. ...1 + 3*(...\n3. ...1 + 3*(...\n4. ...1 + 3*(...\n5. ...1 + 3*(...\n6. ...1 + 3*(...\n7. ...1 + 3*(...\n8. ...1 + 3*(...\n9. ...1 + 3)))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers? Or is it 8? Because the innermost is just 1+3, without another layer. So perhaps the number of layers is 8.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me write it step by step:\n\nStart with the outermost: 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). So that's the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, it's another 1 + 3*(...). So that's the second layer.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), each time adding another layer. Wait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, but the innermost is just 1+3 without another layer. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So starting from the first \"1+3(\", that's layer 1, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3)))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So the innermost is layer 9, which is 1+3, then layer 8 is 1+3*(layer9), etc., up to layer 1, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(layer1). So when I computed up to layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's check that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as I computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Because in the expression, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the outermost is 3*(...). So the number of layers inside the outermost 3*(...) is 9, right? Because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and we have 9 of them, leading to L_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 layers. Hmm, but according to the formula, when n=9, L_9=29524, which is correct. So I think my calculation is right.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. If L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression using the formula without computing each layer. Since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for 9 layers, L_9=29524, so the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula and see if they match my earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer matches the formula. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I count the number of layers, does the outermost 3*(...) count as a layer? Because in the formula, L_n is the nth layer inside the 3*(...). So, the expression is 3*(L_9), so L_9 is the innermost, and each layer up to L_1 is inside the 3*(...). So the total number of layers inside the 3*(...) is 9, so L_9 is the innermost, and L_1 is the outermost before the 3*.\n\nTherefore, the formula applies correctly, and the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more. Let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, without using the formula, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Then, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

    "text": " 3*29,524. Let me break that down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because when I multiply 29,524 by 3, I should get 88,572. Let me verify: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So yes, 88,572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, that was 1 + 3*9841. Let me confirm that: 3*9841: 9841*3. 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, 9841*3 = 29,523. Then adding 1 gives 29,524. So that's correct. Then 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3*(29,524)=88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. I remember that expressions like a + b*(a + b*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here. In this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because our layers are all positive numbers. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The general solution can be found using the formula for linear recurrences of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. The solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + (b*(a^{n} - 1))/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe L_0 would be something else. Let me adjust the indices. Let me set n=1 corresponds to L_1=4. So, the general solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1). We know that when n=1, L_1 = 4. Plugging in n=1: 4 = 3^{1} * L_0 + (3^{1} - 1)/2 => 4 = 3*L_0 + (3 - 1)/2 => 4 = 3L_0 + 1. So, 3L_0 = 3 => L_0 = 1. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me combine these terms: L_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Then, 59,048 /2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me just make sure that the formula applies correctly. Since the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177,147. So, 177,147 -3=177,144. Then, 177,144 /2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it.
