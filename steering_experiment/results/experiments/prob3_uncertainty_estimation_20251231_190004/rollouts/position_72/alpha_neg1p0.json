Wait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, but recognizing the recurrence relation made it faster, especially since there are nine layers. It's always good to look for patterns or formulas when dealing with nested expressions like this. So, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrived at the same answer. I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let's recount the layers to make sure. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer. Then 1+3*(1+3) is the second. Then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)) is the third, and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...). There's one 1+3, then another, up to how many? Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3. So, starting with 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is used. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, that's layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, 1+3*(layer1) is layer2.\n- Then, 1+3*(layer2) is layer3.\n- Continuing until we reach the outermost layer, which is layer9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct. But let me confirm each layer step by step again, just to be sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But maybe I should check the multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to compute the entire expression. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier, computing each layer step by step. So, the sequence is:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check: Since a1 corresponds to n=1, which would be (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. So, yes, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method is more efficient because it uses the closed-form formula instead of computing each layer manually. It reduces the chance of arithmetic errors and is much faster, especially for larger n.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, I found a closed-form solution, which allowed me to compute the value of the innermost expression directly and then proceed outward. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used two different methods (step-by-step computation and recurrence relation), and both led me to the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form solution to compute the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. This can be represented as a recurrence relation: a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\n2. **Find the Closed-form Solution**: Solving the recurrence relation gives a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\n3. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For the given problem, there are 9 layers. Using the closed-form solution, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times a\u2089, which is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but given that it's only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found as a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total. So the outermost layer is Layer 9. Thus, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Let me see. Since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*Layer9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88572. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Each layer can be computed by starting from the innermost one, which is 1 + 3 =4, then each subsequent layer is 1 +3*(previous result). After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, I then multiply that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the nth layer, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, and plugging in n=9, I get (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Both methods lead to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the method, I end up with 88572 as the final answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check for any calculation errors. Let me try computing the layers again, but this time, perhaps using a different approach or verifying each multiplication. Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's correct. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. So, the key steps were recognizing the nested structure, computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and confirming the result using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula. This problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also showed how useful it is to have different methods to arrive at the same answer, which helps in verifying the correctness.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we confirm that the value of the innermost expression (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might have saved me some time. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3,..., L9, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like Ln = a + r*Ln-1, the solution is Ln = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, in this case, a =1, r=3, and the initial term is L1=4. Wait, but let me check. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see: L1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved as follows.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3 Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) = (3^11 -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. I know that 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^10 = 59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total value is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the total expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then total expression = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=3*59049=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which confirms the earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've got it!\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), leading to a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find the value of the innermost expression and work outward, ultimately computing the final result as 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer. The recurrence is \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For the innermost layer (n=1), \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n5. **Work Outward**: Compute each subsequent layer using the formula until reaching the outermost layer (n=9).\n\n6. **Final Computation**: Multiply the outermost layer's value by 3 to get the final result.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Let me double-check my computations for each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, I can think about whether there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it would have given me the same result. So, either way, it seems solid. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here.\n\nLooking at each layer, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me write that down:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, which would be a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute a_9 more efficiently.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c = 1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The general solution was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nBut since the problem was to compute the given expression step by step, I think my initial approach of computing each layer one by one was sufficient, even though it took a bit longer. It's good to know that there's a formula in case the number of layers increases, but for this problem, step-by-step was manageable.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 3:\n\n3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually might be manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 = 3*(3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer n seems to be equal to the sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=n, but wait, let's check: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 3^0 Layer 2: 13 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0? Wait, no, that would be 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40, which is Layer 3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers: For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the general formula. But since I'm just starting out, I think computing each layer step by step is more straightforward, even if it's a bit longer. So, to summarize, the process is: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step. 2. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. Continue this until reaching the outermost layer. 4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. This method ensures that I don't get lost in the parentheses and can keep track of each step. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation or the general formula can speed things up, especially if the number of layers is large. But for nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, I'll recompute a couple of layers to check. Let's check Layer 4: Layer 3 was 40, so Layer 4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps check out. I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation or recognizing the pattern allows us to compute the final result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few layers again to check for errors. Let me recompute Layers 1 through 3: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, the final step is 3 * 29524.

Yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the standard multiplication method: 29524\nx      3\n----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit: 4 * 3 = 12.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without doing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. But just to explore, maybe I can find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me consider that each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the step-by-step computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have computed 3^{10} first, then applied the formula, but since 3^10 is a known value (59049), it's straightforward. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing each layer again quickly: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me double-check my layers because the numbers seem to be increasing quite rapidly, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and each time, the numbers are increasing by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the progression is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572.\n\nI can also think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each term is following a pattern similar to 3^n + something. Let me see if I can express Layer n as a function.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nAssuming the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and particular solution is a constant B.\n\nWait, but let me solve it properly. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) - 3L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) = (3^10 -1)*3/2.\n\nBut 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048*3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer step by step, and also derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could be time-consuming for more layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n, which would make it easier to compute for larger n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Wait, that seems odd because our layers are all positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of solving such recurrences. The general solution is L_n = homogeneous + particular, so L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of this formula, it would be 3 * L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572, same as before. So, this confirms that the result is 88572.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find C. To find the particular solution, we can assume a constant solution L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's a cleaner way to write it. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4, and we have 9 layers, so n=9. Using the formula, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. So, that's the answer. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, which is then multiplied by 3. This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me write it as a recurrence: Let\u2019s define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, L_3=1+3*13=40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1=4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula and see if they match. For example, n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches. n=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. So, the formula works.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems feasible. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer up to the ninth layer, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more efficiently using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Let me check that. The homogeneous solution would be A*3^{n}, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me find the particular solution. Suppose a_p is a constant, then a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, which is fine, but maybe not necessary here since the initial terms are integers. Alternatively, the solution can be written as a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_0 = 4 (since layer 1 is a_1 = 4). Wait, actually, in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So the general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = 3^{n} * C + (3^{n} - 1)/2, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = 3^{1}*C + (3^{1} - 1)/2 => 4 = 3C + (3 - 1)/2 => 4 = 3C + 1 => 3C = 3 => C = 1. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that's interesting. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, this formula works. Therefore, each layer n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, let's see: Wait, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then layer 2 is a_2 = 13, etc., up to layer 9, which is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression using this formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to look at it. But either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go back and check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each one step by step is manageable. Wait, another thought: this seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help, especially if the number of layers increases. But for now, since there are only nine layers, computing each step is feasible. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=0, we can consider a_0 as the term before a_1. From the recurrence, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. Plugging into the general solution: a_0 = A*3^0 + B = A + B = 1. And a_1 = 3A + B = 4. Now, we have two equations: A + B = 1 and 3A + B = 4. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (3A + B) - (A + B) = 4 - 1 => 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from A + B =1, 3/2 + B =1 => B = -1/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. I broke down the problem by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer from the inside out. I verified each step and then looked for a pattern or formula to generalize the computation, which saved time and reduced the chance of error. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the value at layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me just double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the expression is finite and only has nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward. However, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. First, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, let's see what a_9 is. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a closed-form formula. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by this recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we computed earlier. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula, which could save time instead of computing each layer. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, it works. So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, using the closed-form formula confirms our earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this without using recurrence relations. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is exactly the recurrence we had. So, regardless of the approach, we end up with the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. To summarize, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(inner expression). By computing each layer step by step or by using a recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, each subsequent layer builds on that, and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to give the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Each layer's calculation checks out, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about this problem in terms of geometric series or recurrence relations because each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if there's a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, we can model this as a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B\nWe can also consider the steady-state solution when n approaches infinity, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms to see if we can find a pattern.\n\nWe already computed up to a_9 = 29524. Let me see if there's a pattern in the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 13\na_3 = 40\na_4 = 121\na_5 = 364\na_6 = 1093\na_7 = 3280\na_8 = 9841\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term seems to be 3 times the previous term minus 2. Let me check:\n\na_2 = 13 = 3*4 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10? Wait, no, that's not correct. 3*4 is 12, and 12 +1=13, which is correct. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's not a simple multiple minus a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, we arrive at the same answer without computing each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step was manageable, but having a formula is nice.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is structured as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) eight times. Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1+3(...), so each time we have a 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until we have nine layers? Wait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nFrom the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each time, we have a new layer until the last one, which is (1+3). So, how many layers?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is (1+3(...)), so let's count:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(1+3))\nLayer 3: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1+3(1+3(... eight times ...)))\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of layers is 9 because each (1+3) is a new layer, and the entire expression is 3 times that. So, in the expression, starting from the innermost, we have 9 instances of (1+3), each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, the number of layers is 9, which means a_9 is the innermost expression, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute a few layers quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, all correct. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. The expression inside the outermost 3 is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having 9 terms. Wait, but actually, it's not exactly a geometric series because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, so it's more like a sum that's built recursively.\n\nBut using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might not directly apply here because each term is not just a multiple of the previous one; it's 1 plus 3 times the next term.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions, as they seem to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that applies here. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me confirm: The innermost is layer 1: a_1 = 4. Then layer 2: a_2 = 13, which according to the formula would be (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which doesn't match. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps my indexing is off. Let me check again. If n=1 is the innermost layer, then a_1 = 4. According to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524.

Continue this process for each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29,524.\n4. Multiply the ninth layer by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just cross-verify my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just for fun, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could generalize this. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1 =4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2})/2 -1/2= 9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. That's reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, since it's nested, the recurrence approach worked well. Either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation or recognizing the geometric series, we determine that the final value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with large numbers. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds correctly upon the previous one, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recursive expression.\n\nSuppose we define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by this recurrence relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches the layers we computed earlier.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can directly compute it without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since in this problem, there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but it's good to know the general formula for future reference. So, if I have an expression with n layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), the value would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Then, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9 layers, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nExactly the same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. It's always reassuring to check the problem using a different method and arrive at the same answer. It reduces the chance of making a mistake, especially with such large numbers.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I was able to compute the result more efficiently. However, even without that, computing each layer step by step was feasible and led me to the correct answer. It's a good practice to verify results using different methods when possible, especially in exams or important calculations where accuracy is crucial.\n\nOne more thing I might consider is whether there's a way to express this as a geometric series. Let me think. If I expand the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, expanding it all the way, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but that's not exactly accurate because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so it's a bit different.\n\nWait, actually, when you have nested expressions like this, the expansion can be thought of as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see:\n\nStarting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3^1\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3^1\n\nWait, 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? 9 + 3 +1 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 +1? 27 +9+3+1=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=81+27+9+3+1=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, indeed, each layer n corresponds to the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Therefore, Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the formula we derived earlier. So, in general, each layer is a geometric series sum. Therefore, the outermost layer, Layer 9, is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nThis is another way to see why the formula works: each layer is a finite geometric series, and the sum is given by the formula S_n = (r^{n+1} -1)/(r -1), where r=3. So, S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/(3-1)=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, so S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nThis approach solidifies my understanding of why the formula works and how the nested expression relates to a geometric series. It's fascinating how different areas of mathematics interconnect, even in what initially appears to be a simple nested arithmetic problem.\n\nIn conclusion, through both step-by-step computation and recognizing the underlying geometric series, I arrived at the solution of 88572. It was a good exercise in patience and attention to detail, especially with the large numbers involved. I feel more confident now in tackling similar problems by looking for patterns and possible mathematical formulas that can simplify the process.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering the nesting, maybe that's correct. Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, we can use this formula to compute a_9 directly. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by using the closed-form formula for the recursive sequence. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. So, then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, if I let the innermost part be x, then each layer is 1 + 3*x, and so on. But perhaps using the formula I derived earlier is more straightforward. Either way, I think I've arrived at the correct answer by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recursive approach, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's another way to confirm it. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let\u2019s assume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1, which gives B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so having a B of -1/2 seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the form. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me try that. Let\u2019s suppose the particular solution is a constant K. Then, plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm it using the formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something like that. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive relation. The base case is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to a_9. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Because the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if this formula holds. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write down the terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is indeed 1 + 3 times the previous term. To find a closed-form formula for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like this is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we computed earlier. Therefore, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me add them properly: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a closed-form formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
