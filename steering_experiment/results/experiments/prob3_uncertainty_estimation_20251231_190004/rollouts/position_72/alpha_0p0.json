Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which could have saved me time instead of computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total is 3*a_9 = 88572. I wonder if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recursive approach, each layer is computed step by step. Additionally, recognizing the pattern allows the use of a formula for the nth term of the sequence, confirming the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that sometimes when you have expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), there's a formula involving powers. Let me think about that. Suppose we have x = a + b*x. Then, solving for x gives x = a / (1 - b), but that's only if |b| < 1, which isn't the case here because b is 3. So that formula might not apply directly here. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series. Let me see: If I expand the expression, maybe I can represent it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 ... So each layer adds another term with a higher power of 3. So, in general, Layer n: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n. Wait, but in this problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that sum. So, 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9). Let me compute that. The sum inside is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^9. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, n=9. So S = (3^10 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3, we get 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the geometric series approach led me to the same answer. So I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step, revealing a pattern that matches a geometric series. Summing the series and multiplying by 3 yields the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that sometimes expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented using geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, but that might not directly apply here because each layer is deeper. Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see. If I consider each layer as multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is what I did earlier. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 =4, and the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a way to represent this recursively or using a formula, which might make the computation faster, especially if there are many layers. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But according to the general solution, L_n should be A*3^n + B. Therefore, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*( (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 ) = (3^{11})/2 - 3/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147/2 - 3/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I'm done here. It took a while, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped solidify that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and substitute it into the next layer. Repeating this process for each subsequent layer, we eventually compute the outermost expression and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

But let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when I compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation. In fact, this is similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, the recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for Ln. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: L1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9 = (3^10)/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula.

Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, maybe a geometric series or something? Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n is defined recursively. So, for n layers, we have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation first and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Starting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the first, it's another \"1+3(\". So, let's see: The innermost is \"1+3)\", then moving out, each layer adds another \"1+3(\" until the outermost. So, how many layers? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression. From the expression, I can see that there are 9 instances where \"1+3(\" occurs, but actually, each layer adds one more. Wait, let me think differently. The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" because each time it's nested. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Therefore, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first parenthesis is after the first 3, so: 3( Then, inside that, it's 1+3(, so that's the first layer. Then, inside that, another 1+3(, so that's the second layer, and so on. So, each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer until the innermost. So, how many layers? Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3: 1. Then, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the first \"(\", which is after the initial 3, that's the first layer. Then, each subsequent \"(\" is a new layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)  Wait, no, the innermost is 1+3), so the number of \"(\" is 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, layers 1 through 9. Therefore, n=9, as I thought earlier. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which as we saw earlier, leads to a geometric series. The formula we derived is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is a neat closed-form solution. So, using that formula, we can compute a_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if n were larger. But for n=9, it's manageable either way. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and identify the recurrence relation. 2. Compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the method for solving linear recurrences. 4. Verify the result using both methods to ensure correctness. 5. Multiply the final layer by 3 as per the original expression. Therefore, after careful computation and verification, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the nested expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested recurrence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is similar to a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, the sequence is a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so maybe it's a geometric sequence. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the homogeneous part would be a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me try to see how many terms there are. Since there are nine layers, starting from the innermost, each multiplication by 3 adds another layer. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 3's. Wait, actually, when I count the number of 3's inside, starting from the innermost, there are eight 3's before the outermost multiplication. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: Each layer adds a 3. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer out adds another 3*(...). So, the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers. Since there are nine layers, but the outermost is just multiplied by 3, so maybe it's eight multiplications? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, using the formula we found earlier, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same as before. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies this by 3 and adds 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could be time-consuming if there are many layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined recursively. The problem is to compute 3*a_9. Hmm, so we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait a second. When I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I compute 3*9841, I get 29523, and then adding 1 gives 29524. So that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, just to cross-verify. Let's write the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's start from the innermost parentheses: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.

Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.

But wait, let me check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, perhaps using a different method to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. Then, we can see that each term is defined recursively. Let's compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nAnd then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it to find a general formula. Let's try that. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recursive approach, each layer is computed step by step.

But wait, let me check my earlier layers again because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say, instead of nine layers, let's take two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Compute this step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 +12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Now, let's compute it using my layer method: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Then, total is 3*13=39. Correct. So the method works for two layers. Let's try three layers: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))) Compute innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer:1+3*4=13. Next layer:1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Alternatively, compute directly: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4)) = 3*(1 +3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. Correct. So, the method works. Therefore, I can be confident that my computation for nine layers is correct, leading to 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer to see if the pattern holds. Let's take four layers: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))) Compute innermost:1+3=4. Next layer:1+3*4=13. Next layer:1+3*13=40. Next layer:1+3*40=121. Then, 3*121=363. Alternatively, compute directly: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*13)) = 3*(1 +3*40) = 3*(121) = 363. Correct. So, the method works for four layers as well. Therefore, I can trust my approach for nine layers, resulting in 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each subsequent term is defined recursively. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me explore that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9 (n=9), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, the final answer can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation method confirmed it.

Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me check that. If a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, let's apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). The outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Therefore, regardless of the method, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find a closed-form formula.

Hmm, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous. So, in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, first, let's compute layer 9. Using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer, which results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar term)}\\).\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's a bit different. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which matches Layer 1. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is Layer 2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (a_0 + c/(r-1))*(r)^n - c/(r-1). Wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_0 + c/(k-1)) * k^n - c/(k-1). In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k = 3, c = 1. The general solution would then be a_n = (a_0 + (1)/(3-1)) * 3^n - (1)/(3-1) = (a_0 + 1/2) * 3^n - 1/2. But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4. Let me see: When n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the formula: a_1 = (a_0 + 1/2)*3^1 - 1/2 = 4. So, (a_0 + 1/2)*3 - 1/2 = 4. Let's solve for a_0: 3*(a_0 + 1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, a_0 + 1/2 = (9/2)/3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2. Therefore, a_0 = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1. Hmm, so a_0 = 1. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, perhaps the formula is a_n = (a_0 + 1/2)*3^n - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 would be (1 + 1/2)*3^9 - 1/2 = (3/2)*19683 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3/2 * 19683 = (3*19683)/2. Let's compute 3*19683: 19683*3: 19683*2=39366, plus 19683 is 59049. So, 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. That's exactly what we got earlier for Layer 9. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once again quickly to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that all checks out.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.

    "text": " Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = (a_0 + c/(1 - r)) * r^n, assuming r \u2260 1. Wait, but in this case, a_1 is given as 4, so maybe it's better to write it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a geometric series, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to expanding a geometric series with ratio 3. But since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation approach, I was able to find a closed-form solution, which is much more efficient than computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in this case, since there are 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but knowing the formula could save time in the future. Another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is building up a number in base 3 or something, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me explore that. Let's see, starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 ... So, each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but actually, in Layer 1, it's 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, indeed, each layer n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^{n}. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I found earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a geometric series can simplify the computation. I think I've got a good understanding of how this works now. To recap, each layer adds another power of 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n, and the sum of that series gives the value of each layer. The outermost layer, being the 9th, gives us a total that, when multiplied by 3, gives the final result. I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer after verifying it through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and recognizing the geometric series pattern. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but it's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with multiple layers and exponents. Another thing I could do to verify is compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the method holds. For example, if I had just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), that would be 3 layers. Let's compute that using both methods. Step-by-step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Then, 3*40 = 120. Using the formula: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem. In conclusion, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable layers and recognizing the underlying geometric series, I was able to compute the value step by step and verify it using different methods. This approach ensures accuracy and provides a clear understanding of how the solution is reached.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more formally. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. So, a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as before. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, using the formula confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step expansion and solving the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result.

Hmm, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again to avoid any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. This seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{k+1} = 1 + 3*a_k. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_k, that would be helpful. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_k. The recurrence relation is a_{k+1} = 1 + 3*a_k, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{k+1} - 3*a_k = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When k=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for k=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can write the expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me verify a couple more layers.

So, to recap, I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step. Each layer was computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Once I reached the outermost layer, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. This approach worked because each layer depends on the previous one, so solving them sequentially made the problem manageable. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down step by step helped prevent mistakes. I don't think I made any calculation errors, as I double-checked a few layers and the multiplication at the end.

    "text": " Next, 2*3=6 +1=7. Next, 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next, 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next, 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression, like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let each layer be a term in a sequence, say a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., as I did before. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Now, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 =4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume n=0 is defined, but maybe it's easier to find a pattern. Alternatively, let's compute the first few terms and see if we can find a pattern. a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Let me check: a_2 = 13, which is 3*4 +1=13. a_3=1 +3*13=40, which is 3*13 +1=40. Wait, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. Now, to solve this recurrence, we can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0, whose solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works for each layer. So, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. The innermost term is 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear, so we can solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows a geometric progression. Since each term is 1 + 3*previous term, and starting from 4, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since we have a recurrence, the formula we derived earlier is more straightforward. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Recomputing a_9: 3^10 is 59049, yes, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524 (correct). Then the final step: 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented by a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches what I calculated earlier. Similarly, for n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which is the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've covered all the steps thoroughly, checking each computation and even deriving a general formula to confirm the result. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down systematically helps avoid mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.

Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I used Layer 8 as 9841. Let me double-check Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. So that's correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think about this problem in terms of a geometric series or a recurrence relation because each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let's find C. We can write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I can think about this as each layer being a term in a geometric sequence. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which leads to a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, actually, no. Wait, let's see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. But 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but that sum is a geometric series: sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the closed-form solution we found earlier. So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern, but given the structure, working from the inside out seems straightforward. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c=3, d=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation layer by layer and solving the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to use a formula, confirming the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute this without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. It's good to know both the step-by-step computation and the formula in case I need to solve similar problems in the future. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the manual computations. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This looks similar to a geometric series but in a nested form. Alternatively, perhaps each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with the base case f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, for each layer, f(n) = 3 + 3*f(n-1). Let me see if this recursion holds. For n=1, f(1)=4. For n=2, f(2)=3*(1 + f(1))=3*(1+4)=3*5=15? Wait, but earlier I had Layer 2 as 13. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps my function is wrong. Wait, no, in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Let me check that. Then, f(1)=1 + 3=4. f(2)=1 + 3*f(1)=1 + 3*4=13. That's correct. f(3)=1 + 3*f(2)=1 + 3*13=40. Correct. So, yes, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. So, if I can find a closed-form expression for f(n), that might save time instead of computing each layer. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for f(n). The recursive formula is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, let's write out the first few terms: f(1) = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which is what I had before. Now, to find a closed-form solution for f(n), let's consider the recurrence relation f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1)=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f_h(n) = 3*f_h(n-1), whose solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, f(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the closed-form approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{10} directly. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all my calculations seem consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's assume L(n) = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer computation and the general formula using recurrence relations\u2014give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
