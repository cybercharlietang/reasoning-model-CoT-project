    "text": " Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about it. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Then solving for x would give x = 1 + 3x => x - 3x = 1 => -2x = 1 => x = -1/2. But in our case, it's a finite nesting, not infinite. So perhaps each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1. So L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. Then the total expression is 3*L9. So, more formally, we can define L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L1 = 4. So, we can compute each Lk step by step as I did before. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*Lk-1, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: Lk = A*3^{k} + B. Then Lk-1 = A*3^{k-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{k} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{k} + B = 1 + A*3^{k} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{k} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is Lk = A*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1=4. So when k=1, L1=4= A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since Lk = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, which equals 29,524, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4, as before.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 =1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1 +120=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +363=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +1092=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3279=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +9840=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me see: Each time, we have a term that is 1 plus 3 times the previous. So, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nIf I expand this recursively, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which leads to a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nIn fact, from the formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me try expanding it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 =1 +3.\n\nE2=1 +3*(1 +3)=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct because each step is 1 +3*(previous). So, E3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=40, which is 1 +39=40.\n\nBut if I expand E3, it's 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nSimilarly, E4=1 +3*E3=1 +3*40=1 +120=121, which is 1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121.\n\nWait a second, I see a pattern here. Each E_n is the sum of a geometric series where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=n.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nE1=1 +3=4= (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4.\n\nE2=13= (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13.\n\nE3=40= (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40.\n\nE4=121= (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121.\n\nYes, so each E_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nE1=1 +3=4=3^0 +3^1.\n\nE2=1 +3*E1=1 +3*(3^0 +3^1)=1 +3^1 +3^2=1 +3 +9=13=3^0 +3^1 +3^2.\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*(3^0 +3^1 +3^2)=1 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3=1 +3 +9 +27=40=3^0 +3^1 +3^2 +3^3.\n\nContinuing this way, each E_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our case, E1 corresponds to n=1: sum from k=0 to1=3^0 +3^1=1 +3=4.\n\nSimilarly, E2=sum from k=0 to2=1 +3 +9=13.\n\nE3=sum from k=0 to3=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to E9=sum from k=0 to9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the original expression is 3*E9=3*(sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k)=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is that the entire expression is 3 times the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^9, which sums to (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nThe sum S of the first n+1 terms of a geometric series with first term a=1 and ratio r=3 is S=(3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so S=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with everything else.\n\nI think I've confirmed it multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which would have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a type of recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. This seems similar to the pattern of a geometric sequence, but with a constant term added each time. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*(3)^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. To find D, we can consider the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers, which is reassuring. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps because when I computed Layer 9, I might have made a mistake. Let me go back step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By solving the recurrence relation, I found a formula for each layer, computed the ninth layer, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Everything checks out, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer sequentially until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, let me just double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats multiple times, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems similar to a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, using both the iterative step-by-step method and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, as I thought. So, the computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572. I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think\u2014this looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution would be a constant, say B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.

Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the exponentiation. 3^10 is 59049, correct? Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The closed-form we found earlier is indeed a geometric series sum formula.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that with a different method. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the innermost expression was 4, then each subsequent layer built upon that, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's see, this structure resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r-1)) * (r^{n} - 1) + a_0, but wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Let me check the formula.\n\nWait, the standard solution for a linear recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1, so a_1 = r*a_0 + c.\n\nSo, if we take a_0 as the initial term, which in our case would be a_0 = 1 + 3*... Wait, no, because our innermost term is a_1 = 1 + 3, so maybe a_0 isn't defined. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the recurrence starts at a_1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since we've already computed each layer step by step and got a consistent result, maybe it's safer to stick with that. But just for thoroughness, let me try to compute using the formula.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find B first. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recursive formula. So, a_1=4, a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n, which might save time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, layer 1 is 4, which should be a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, confirming that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Applying this pattern and verifying with a closed-form formula, we determine the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers, starting from the innermost 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nBecause the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, 9 layers, each computed correctly as above.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nSo Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.

Let's see:\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo yes, using the recurrence relation formula confirms our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, we could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes when multiplying, especially with larger numbers, it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and verify each step again because if any layer is wrong, the subsequent ones will be too. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to follow the pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression without computing each layer. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my multiplication: 29524 *3. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, carry over 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's another way to compute it. Let me check: 29524 = 30000 - 476. So 30000 *3=90000. 476*3=1428. So 90000 - 1428=88572. Correct. So that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=(177144)/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer. That's a much faster method, especially if the number of layers is large. But since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, knowing the formula is useful for future problems of this type.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding its closed-form solution, I could compute the value efficiently. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also works, though it's more time-consuming. Either way, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding its closed-form solution, we can compute the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should recompute each layer step by step to confirm. Let me list them again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So then 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might not be correct because the numbers seem to be growing too rapidly. Let me check each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524.

Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K =1 +3*K.\n\nSolving: K =1 +3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow apply initial condition: a_1 =4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than additive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Assume solution a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But since it's nested, it's more like a repeated multiplication. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the value at each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3, but offset by the 1s. But since I already have the closed-form formula, I think it's more straightforward to use that. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Compute 1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840.

Let me just check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_i where i goes from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, this seems similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nIn general, for such a recurrence relation, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.\n\nYes, the general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1 is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which we verified with the initial terms.\n\nSo, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As computed earlier, that's 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify 29524 * 3 once more. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, just to cross-verify. Let me think: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost term, it's 1 + 3, then each next term is 1 + 3 times the previous. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define the terms as follows: Let a_n be the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But a_n is also equal to A*3^n + B, so setting them equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I can conclude that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and then applying the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n is 9, but let's generalize it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1} for k >= 2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when k=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using recurrence relations and finding a closed-form formula. That might be faster if there are many layers, but since here there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases. Let me just recap the steps: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Alternatively, model the problem with a recurrence relation, solve it, and compute the result using the closed-form formula. Both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right.

So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048 +29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 =79048\n\n79048 +9000=88048\n\n88048 +500=88548\n\n88548 +24=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the innermost part, right? So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from 1 + 3, that's 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on. So, I think I did that correctly. Let me just recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 + 39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 + 3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.

Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which I interpreted as 3*(Layer 9). But wait, let me check how many layers there are. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer, and then each closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's nine \"1+3(\" instances, meaning that the innermost is the ninth one. So, when I computed Layer 1 as the innermost, that's correct, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but to make absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute the entire expression step by step, layer by layer, to confirm that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me write down each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the computations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplications and additions seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3. However, in this case, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, which complicates it a bit.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the outermost layer would be f(9), and the entire expression is 3*f(9). Let's compute f(n) for n=1 to 9:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nf(3) =1 +3*f(2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nf(4)=1 +3*f(3)=1 +3*40=121\n\nf(5)=1 +3*f(4)=1 +3*121=364\n\nf(6)=1 +3*f(5)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nf(7)=1 +3*f(6)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nf(8)=1 +3*f(7)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nf(9)=1 +3*f(8)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. This confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: f(1)=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: f(4)=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nThis method using the closed-form formula confirms the result again, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer adds a power of 3. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. However, the formula approach was quite effective.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem layer by layer, computing each nested expression step by step, and then verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the solution of 88572. I think this is solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off.

So that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series, but I'm not sure if it's applicable here because each term is 1 + 3*previous term, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's compute that. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would make the final result 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and there are nine such layers, right? Let me count the opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer, and there are nine of them. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, yes, I think I did that correctly.\n\nWait, but another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, n=3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, let me try to compute it again step by step, just to be absolutely sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. Let's check what n is. Wait, in our layers, Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, which is 4. So, a_1 = 4.\n\nPlugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also gave me the same result. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Correct. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it's a form of a continued multiplication. Maybe it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by b and added a. But in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote the innermost as L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The general form is Ln = a + r*Ln-1, where a=1 and r=3 here. The solution for such a recurrence is Ln = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1) + (L0*r - a)/(r - 1). Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for Ln. Since each term is defined as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. So, in general, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by substituting the previous result. The recurrence relation for each layer is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, which can be solved using a closed-form formula. The final result is 3 times the outermost layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition.

Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nL_3 =1 +3*L2=1 +39=40.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)}= K. Plugging into the recurrence: K =3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. So, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is L1=4, and we go up to L9. So, L9= (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check: If n=9, then L9= (3^{10}-1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9)=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of this formula. Since the original expression is 3*(L9), and L9= (3^{10}-1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nThis seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. But knowing the formula could save time.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, verifying the layers:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nMultiply by 3:88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nConsistent as well.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we find it equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have messed up when computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because sometimes I might make a mistake there.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is 1 + 3(...). Each time, another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let's see:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3(Layer8)\n\nSo yes, 9 layers in total. So when I computed up to Layer9, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've done this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSo, a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems interesting. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

Hmm, but wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me check my calculations again because 3*(Layer 9) is 88,572, but let me make sure each layer was computed correctly. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. So I feel confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Let me just recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3*(...). So the original expression is 3*(...), which is 3 times layer 9. So the layers are 1 through 9, each computed as above. So I think my computation is correct.

Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me count the layers again to be sure. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think I did that correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check if the expression is correctly parsed. The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's take a smaller version with just two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120.\n\nCompute manually: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work for smaller cases, so I think it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, and then multiplying by 3, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when numbers get large, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I've computed it correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe will compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say L_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D =1 => D= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, when n=1: L_1= C*3^1 -1/2=3C -1/2=4. So, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplify: L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. So, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence. Maybe there's a formula for this.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c=3 and d=1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1).\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for such a linear recurrence. The general solution is a_n = (a_1 + (d)/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - (d)/(c-1).\n\nSo, in this case, c=3, d=1, a_1=4.\n\nThus, a_n = (4 + (1)/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - (1)/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) )= (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (3^{n+1})/2. Wait, let me compute:\n\n(9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) )= (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (3^{n+1})/2. Because 9/2 divided by 3 is 3/2, and 3^{n}/3 is 3^{n-1}, but perhaps another way.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to compute it as:\n\n(9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (9/2)*(3^{n-1}) = 3^{n+1}/2.\n\nWait, 9 is 3^2, so 9/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^{10}=59049. Yes, because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049, then 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern defined by the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\). Using the closed-form solution for this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer is computed accordingly. Finally, multiplying the ninth layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3 is the same as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7.\n0 +5=5.\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\nSo 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing one. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears before the first closing parenthesis. Hmm, perhaps it's better to see how many nested layers there are. Let me try to parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have a 1 + 3(....). The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the next is 1 + 3(, then another 1 + 3(, and so on until we have 9 layers. Wait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me check: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if that's correct. Maybe I should compute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications or additions.\n\nLet me write down each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps?\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution A.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolve for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
