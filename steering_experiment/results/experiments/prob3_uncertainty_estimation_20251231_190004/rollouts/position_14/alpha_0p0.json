    "text": " Let me define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, interesting. Let me do Layer 4 now. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, that's getting big quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Wow, so each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let me write down the results so far:\n\n- Layer 1: 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n- Layer 4: 121\n- Layer 5: 364\n\nHmm, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364. I wonder if these numbers follow a specific sequence. Let me check the ratios between successive terms:\n\n- 13 / 4 = 3.25\n- 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077\n- 121 / 40 \u2248 3.025\n- 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\n\nHmm, so each time, the ratio is approaching 3. That makes sense because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), so as the terms get larger, the impact of the +1 becomes smaller, and the ratio approaches 3. So, maybe each layer is roughly 3 times the previous layer, but slightly more because of the +1.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a general formula for Layer n. Let's denote L(n) as the value of Layer n. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. That's a recursive formula. I wonder if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L(n). Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution to such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L(5) = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works! So, now I can use this formula to compute Layer 9, which is L(9). Let me compute L(9):\n\nL(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times L(9), so:\n\nTotal = 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me compute that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 7 5 7 2 4? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me write it properly:\n\n   29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is 88572, right? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, so the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which is different. I must have made a mistake in the digit alignment. Let me try that again.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 877572? That can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is a 5-digit number, not 6 digits. So, I think I messed up the digit alignment. Let me write it properly with place values:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *       3\n\n    -----------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. I used the formula L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 for Layer n. For n=9, that's (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step without using the formula to confirm. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nWait, hold on. Earlier, I thought Layer 5 was 364, which is correct, but Layer 6 should be 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 364*3=1,092; 1,092 +1=1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that matches the previous result. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula, I got L(9)=29,524, which is the same as Layer 9. So, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes in the step-by-step computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps are correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this problem is recognizing that each layer is part of a geometric series. Let me explore that angle to see if I can derive the same result.\n\nGiven that each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4, as we saw earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation, which we solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. We found that L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum, perhaps I can express it as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me denote the innermost term as T1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, T2 = 1 + 3*T1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, T3 = 1 + 3*T2 = 40, and so on, up to T9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*T9.\n\nBut since each Tn = 1 + 3*T(n-1), and we've already solved that Tn = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, so T9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29,524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression without using the formula, it would involve expanding each layer step by step, which we did earlier, and it's a bit tedious but straightforward.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that the expression is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a sum.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as S1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nContinuing this way, each Sn adds another term that's 3^n.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, in general, Sn = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n\n\nWait, that's a geometric series with n+1 terms, starting from 3^0=1 up to 3^n.\n\nYes, so Sn = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly the formula we derived earlier for L(n). So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, S9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, this approach also confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of binary or another base, but I don't think that's necessary here since the problem is straightforward with the methods we've used.\n\nJust to ensure that I'm not missing any alternative interpretations, let me reread the problem: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, it's a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer, starting from the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same result: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the formula for the nth layer, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, we find Layer 9 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, since it's nested, the innermost is the last one, so maybe I should work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let me try that. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)), and so on, until I reach the outermost layer. Let me try to compute each step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me calculate that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n3. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n4. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). So, 1 + 3*40. That's 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext layer:\n\n5. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nContinuing:\n\n6. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). So, 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093.\n\nNext layer:\n\n7. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). So, 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280.\n\nNext:\n\n8. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). So, 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer:\n\n9. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). So, 1 + 3*9,841. Let me calculate that: 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is:\n\n10. Compute 3*(result from step 9). That's 3*29,524. Let me do that multiplication: 3*29,524. Let me break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 3*29,524 is the same as 3*(29,000 + 524) = 3*29,000 + 3*524. 3*29,000 is 87,000. 3*524: Let's compute 524*3. 500*3 is 1,500, 24*3 is 72, so total is 1,500 + 72 = 1,572. Adding that to 87,000 gives 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Then 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3,000+270=3,270 +9=3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So total is 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 41*3=123. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 123 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\n10. Finally, 3*29,524: Let me compute this again. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nHmm, same result as before. So, it seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and each layer is built on top of the previous one. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this without having to compute each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. But in this case, since there are nine layers, maybe it's manageable, but perhaps for more layers, a formula would be better.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3, we have:\n\n1 + 3( ... )\n\nThen inside that, another 1 + 3( ... ), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the string: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 that's the first layer.\n2. Then inside, another 1+3(...) \u2013 that's the second layer.\n3. And so on until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost (1+3). Let me check:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are:\n\n- After the first 3(, we have 1+3( \u2013 that's one.\n- Then inside that, another 1+3( \u2013 that's two.\n- Continuing, each time we have another 1+3( until we reach the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is just (1+3), without another 1+3(. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm by counting the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the initial 3( is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside, 1+3(...\n3. Repeating until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...)), that's the first layer. Then inside, another 1+3(...), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"1+3(\" after the initial 3( adds a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then 1+3(...\n3. Then another 1+3(...\n4. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each time you go in, you add a layer, and the innermost is the 9th. Let me check by writing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1 + 3(...))\nLayer 2: 3(1 + 3(...))\n...\nLayer 9: (1 + 3)\n\nSo, I think there are 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to step 9, that was the innermost, and then step 10 was the multiplication by 3. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had 9 layers, each with their own computation, leading up to step 9, which was the innermost. Then step 10 was the final multiplication by 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I started computing, I had steps 1 through 9, each being a layer, and then step 10 being the outermost multiplication by 3. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are:\n\n- After the initial 3(, there's 1+3(, then inside that, another 1+3(, and so on until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each time you have \"1+3(\", and the innermost is (1+3), which doesn't have another \"1+3(\" after it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. After the first 3(, we have 1+3( \u2013 that's one.\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3( \u2013 that's two.\n3. Continuing, each time we have another 1+3(.\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\n- 3(1+3(...) \u2013 that's one \"1+3(\".\n- Inside that, 1+3(...) \u2013 that's two.\n- Then another 1+3(...) \u2013 three.\n- Then four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps there are nine \"1+3(\" instances, meaning nine layers. So, each layer from 1 to 9. Therefore, my initial computation of nine layers, each step 1 to 9, is correct, and then step 10 is the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed step 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Let me recompute each step quickly:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier for step 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it more quickly without having to compute each step manually. That's a good way to verify the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1,093\n7. (1 + 3*1,093) = 3,280\n8. (1 + 3*3,280) = 9,841\n9. (1 + 3*9,841) = 29,524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, my plan is to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3. Let me start computing each layer. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4 **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 88572. Okay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.

    "text": " Let me define a sequence where each term corresponds to a layer. Let's say:\n- Let a\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081\n- Then a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082\n- And so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which would be a\u2081. Then the next one out is 1 + 3a\u2081, which would be a\u2082. So, each a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Hmm, that seems right. So, I can compute each a\u2099 step by step until I get to a\u2089, and then multiply by 3 as the outermost operation. Let me verify that. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), and each time, the innermost is 1 + 3, so that's a\u2081. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 times the previous a. So, yes, a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. So, I can compute a\u2081 through a\u2089 and then multiply the final a\u2089 by 3 to get the result. Let me write down each step:\n\n1. Compute a\u2081 = 1 + 3\n2. Compute a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081\n3. Compute a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082\n4. Continue this until a\u2089\n5. Then the final result is 3 * a\u2089\n\nOkay, let's start computing each a\u2099 step by step.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThat was simple. Now, a\u2082:\na\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to a\u2083:\na\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 40. Okay, a\u2084:\na\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 121? That seems a bit big, but okay. Let's keep going.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWhoa, that's jumping up quickly. a\u2085 is 364. a\u2086:\na\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, 1093. a\u2087:\na\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nOkay, 3280. a\u2088:\na\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThat's a big number. a\u2089:\na\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a\u2089 is 29,524. Now, the final step is to multiply this by 3, as per the original expression:\n\nResult = 3 * a\u2089 = 3 * 29,524\n\nLet me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding those together:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to get lost in the numbers, especially with such large values. Let me go through each a\u2099 again:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out. Each a\u2099 is computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate. So, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time if there were more layers. Let me think about that. The recursive relation is a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, a\u2081 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a\u2089, that would be (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3 * a\u2089 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each step manually or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. I've broken down the problem, computed each layer step by step, checked my work, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is defined recursively, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost value by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer from a\u2081 to a\u2089:\n   - a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 13\n   - a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 40\n   - a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 121\n   - a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 364\n   - a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1093\n   - a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 3280\n   - a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 9841\n   - a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the final layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me confirm how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3  \n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)  \n3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))  \n... and this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around Layer 1, and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:  \nLayer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2:  \nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3:  \nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4:  \nLayer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5:  \nLayer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6:  \nLayer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7:  \nLayer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8:  \nLayer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9:  \nLayer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3 * 29,524. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3  \n= (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)  \n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72  \n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because that seems like a lot of computation. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer calculation again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a few layers again or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let me try to model this.\n\nGiven that Layer 1 = 4, and Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Let's write out the first few terms:\n\nLayer 1: 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n... etc.\n\nLooking at this sequence: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364,...\n\nI wonder if this is a known sequence or if it can be modeled as a geometric series. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for Layer n.\n\nGiven the recursive formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is: Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = A*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C  \n=> C - 3C = 1  \n=> -2C = 1  \n=> C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n=> 4 = 3A - 1/2  \n=> 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \n=> A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000  \n9,000 * 3 = 27,000  \n500 * 3 = 1,500  \n24 * 3 = 72  \nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000  \n87,000 +1,500=88,500  \n88,500 +72=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then 3*Layer9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me think of each innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, the innermost part is just 1 + 3, right?

So, maybe I can create a table to keep track of each layer.\n\nLet me make a table with two columns: Layer Number and Value.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nWait, is that right? Let me compute Layer 4 again. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.

Let me check that again. So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time I'm multiplying the previous layer's value by 3 and adding 1. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's compute that step by step.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the numbers from top to bottom, it's 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. We know that L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, substituting n = 1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nWe also know that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n will dominate unless A = 0. But in our case, since each term is finite, we can solve for B by considering the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, we can use the method for solving linear recurrences.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting L_p(n) into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have Layer 9, which is (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I found that the innermost layer computes to 4, each subsequent layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, leading up to Layer 9 being 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors because both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave me the same answer. So, I'm pretty confident that 88,572 is the correct result for this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I add a layer. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers, which I computed up to L9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, so yes, L9 is the outermost layer, and then we multiply by 3, so 3*L9 is the entire expression.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*L8. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, using the formula for each layer:\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 13\n\nL3: 40\n\nL4: 121\n\nL5: 364\n\nL6: 1093\n\nL7: 3280\n\nL8: 9841\n\nL9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we determine that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost one. So, E1 = 1 + 3(1 + 3) \u2014 wait, no, actually, E1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, right? Wait, no, because the innermost is 1 + 3(...), but if I go all the way in, the innermost is just 1 + 3, because beyond that, it's 1 + 3(1 + 3), etc. Let me check that. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears before the first closing parenthesis. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3 times that. So, maybe the innermost is E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on up to E9, and the entire expression is 3*E9. Hmm, that seems right. So, if I compute E1 through E9 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me try that. Let's start with E1. E1 = 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 is 4. So, E1 = 4. Now, E2 is 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, E2 = 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, E3 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, E4 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. E5 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. E6 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. E7 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. E8 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, E9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do this step by step. 29,524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524, and then 3*29524=88,572. Each step seems correct. Let me check one of the middle steps to be sure. For example, E4: 1 + 3*E3. E3 was 40, so 3*40=120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. Yes, that seems right.

    "text": " Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093: Let's calculate that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say I have just 1 layer: 3(1 + 3). That's 3*(4) = 12. If I compute it step by step: Layer 1 = 4, then 3*4 = 12. Correct. Now, two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute it. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3*(4) = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. So, the result is 39. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. So, the method works for two layers. Let's try three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Direct computation: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct again. So, the pattern holds. Therefore, it's likely that my computation for nine layers is correct. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Identify the nested structure. 2. Start computing from the innermost layer. 3. Use each computed layer to compute the next one outward. 4. Continue this until reaching the outermost layer. 5. Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression. Each step built upon the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer, I arrived at the final answer. It's a bit tedious with nine layers, but the method is systematic and reduces the complexity step by step. I don't think I made any calculation errors because each step checked out when I reviewed it, and the smaller examples worked as expected. So, I'm pretty sure 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost.

Let me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7:\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8:\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding up: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9:\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, so the final result is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nLet me check if this is correct by another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9. Because when I calculated E9, it was 1 + 3*E8, where E8 was 9841. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems right.\n\nThen, 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me just go through each step again to ensure I didn't make any errors in the calculations.\n\nStarting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nI think that's solid. Each step builds on the previous one without any errors. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients. The formula is:\n\nE_n = a^{n} * E_0 + (b*(a^{n} - 1))/(a - 1)\n\nWait, but in our case, E1 = 4, which is the first term. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about it. The recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, E1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C\nWhich is 9/2 = 3C\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E9 = 29524, and the final result is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms the result I obtained by computing each layer step by step. It's reassuring to see that both methods lead to the same answer.\n\nAnother way to think about this is by recognizing that each E_n is part of a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the expression E_n is essentially a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore this angle.\n\nGiven the recurrence E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nIf I expand E_n, it becomes:\n\nE_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1\n= 3*(3*E_{n-2} + 1) + 1\n= 3^2*E_{n-2} + 3 + 1\nContinuing this expansion, after n-1 steps, we get:\n\nE_n = 3^{n-1}*E1 + 3^{n-2} + 3^{n-3} + ... + 3 + 1\n\nSince E1 = 4, this becomes:\n\nE_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nWait, the sum 3^{n-2} + 3^{n-3} + ... + 3 + 1 is a geometric series with first term 1, ratio 3, and number of terms n-1. The sum of such a series is (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me simplify this:\n\nE_n = (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich matches the formula we derived earlier. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, again, the same result.\n\nThis reinforces that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} is 59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this thoroughly through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series. All approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nJust to recap, here's a summary of each step:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Label each layer as E1 through E9, where each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n3. Compute each E step by step, starting from E1 = 4 up to E9 = 29524.\n4. Multiply the final E9 by 3 to get the result.\n5. Alternatively, derive a formula for E_n using recurrence relations and verify it against the step-by-step computations.\n6. Confirm the result using the formula, ensuring consistency.\n\nThis problem is a good example of how recognizing patterns and using mathematical formulas can simplify what initially seems like a tedious computation. Instead of computing each layer individually, which could be error-prone, especially for larger n, using the recurrence relation or geometric series approach provides a more efficient and accurate method.\n\nI feel confident that the answer is correct after multiple checks. It's always good practice to verify your work, especially when dealing with repetitive calculations or nested structures that can easily lead to mistakes if not approached systematically.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each inner expression as \\( E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_9 \\), where each \\( E_n \\) is defined as:\n\n\\[ E_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying \\( E_9 \\) by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot E_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, the next one is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3( ... ) but wait, the innermost one is actually just 1 + 3, right? Wait, no, looking again, the innermost is 1 + 3, but then that's multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Wait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, but that's part of the next layer. Wait, let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count how many layers there are. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(Layer n). So, let's define each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I look at the expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and that inner part has eight more layers, so total layers inside the outermost 3 would be 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me confirm: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then moving out, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me define each Layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but hold on, when I was counting layers, I thought the outermost was 3*(Layer 9), but actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is as I computed. But let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, the first is 3*(...), then inside is 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the innermost expression first and work our way out.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer out: 3*(innermost) = 3*4 = 12, then 1 + that = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 3*364 = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 3*1093 = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 3*3280 = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 3*9841 = 29523, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carry 0\n\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Let's break down 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) *3 = 30,000*3 - 476*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, let me write it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSubtract 3C from both sides:\n\n-2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nSame result.

So, starting with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 8 is 13. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 7 is 40.

So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, step-by-step computation is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a recurrence relation: Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of Layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, so each layer is multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. I can see a pattern here. Maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. If each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall: If we have a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^n*a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, in this case, c is 1, and r is 3. But actually, our recurrence is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, more accurately, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let me confirm: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. But wait, in our problem, the layers go up to 9. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 *3. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 +24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 +27000 =87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. So, the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me check my steps again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct, but let me compute it step by step without the formula to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.

Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, 88,572 is correct. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I wrote 88572, which is the same as 88,572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each A\u2099 is defined as A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2081 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for A\u2099. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is A\u2099 = 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1. The homogeneous solution is when we ignore the +1, so A\u2099 = 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, which has the solution A\u2099 = C*3\u207f. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 \u21d2 D - 3D = 1 \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2. So, the general solution is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition A\u2081 = 4. So, when n = 1: 4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is A\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, A\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's check if this works with our earlier computations. For n=1: A\u2081 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: A\u2082 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: A\u2083 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, A\u2089 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. So, A\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Since the original expression has nine layers, each time adding a new 1 + 3(...), so A\u2081 through A\u2089, each defined as above. So, yes, A\u2089 is the outermost layer, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(A\u2089), and since A\u2089 is (3^10 - 1)/2, then 3*A\u2089 = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get there using the formula. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is defined as $A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1}$, starting with $A_1 = 4$. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each $A_n$ follows the formula $A_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For $n=9$, we compute $A_9 = 29524$. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost (1+3), then each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2). So, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, maybe it's 9 layers in total. Let me verify: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, counting the number of times we have 1 + 3(...), I think there are 9 layers. Let me write each layer down step by step. Let's define Layer1 as (1 + 3). Then Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1). Layer3 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and so on until Layer9, which is the outermost layer. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I need to compute Layer1 through Layer9 and then multiply the result by 3. Let's compute each layer one by one. Starting with Layer1: Layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now Layer2: Layer2 = 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer2 = 13. Now Layer3: Layer3 = 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer3 = 40. Layer4: Layer4 = 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer4 = 121. Layer5: Layer5 = 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer5 = 364. Layer6: Layer6 = 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 +1 = 1093. So Layer6 = 1093. Layer7: Layer7 = 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 +1 = 3280. So Layer7 = 3280. Layer8: Layer8 = 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then add 1: 9840 +1 = 9841. So Layer8 = 9841. Layer9: Layer9 = 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 +1 = 29524. So Layer9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 *3: Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add those together: 60000 +27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 60=88560, plus 12=88572. So 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute it again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.

Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9.

Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3 and b=1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 is 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me check the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. For a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But in our case, we have L_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. So, if we take n as the number of layers, starting from 1, then L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, etc., up to L_9. So, the general solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, L_0 would be the value when n=0. Let me see. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, plugging into the formula: 4 = 3^{1} * L_0 + (3^{1} - 1)/(3 - 1). So, 4 = 3*L_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*L_0 + 2/2 = 3*L_0 + 1. Then, 3*L_0 = 4 - 1 = 3, so L_0 = 1. So, the general formula is L_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, L_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me combine the terms: L_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a direct formula for the entire expression. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Defined each layer as L_n =1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. 3. Computed each layer up to L_9, which gave me 29524. 4. Then multiplied by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524=88572. 5. Verified using a formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, which also gave me 88572. So, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly.

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as follows: Let\u2019s define E1 as the innermost part: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 E4 = 1 + 3*E3 ... and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. That seems manageable. So, let me compute each E step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to E2: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, E2 is 13. Next, E3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. E4: 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, these numbers are increasing quickly. Let me keep going. E5: 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6: 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7: 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8: 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9: 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because these numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nStarting again, perhaps writing each step more carefully:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, E1 to E9. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression to see if the result matches. Let's see. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, E1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result as when I computed each step manually. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the expansion might form a geometric progression. Let me try to see.\n\nStarting from the innermost term:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, that seems like a geometric series with ratio 3, but each E_n adds another term.\n\nWait, let me write E_n as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nSo, expanding E_n, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but when n=1, E1=1+3=4=1+3= sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k.\n\nSimilarly, E2=1+3*(1+3)=1 + 3 + 9=13, which is 1+3+9= sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but E3=1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9)=1 + 3 + 9 + 27= sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k=40.\n\nSo, in general, E_n = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nBut the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier. So, E_n is indeed the sum of the geometric series up to 3^n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for E9, n=9, so E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each step manually, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check with a smaller number of layers.\n\nLet me test with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula holds.\n\nSuppose I have only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute it step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3=4.\n\nThen, 3(1 + 3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39.\n\nUsing the formula: n=2 layers, so E2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Then, total expression is 3*E2=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Compute it step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=13.\n\nOuter layer:3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula: n=3 layers, E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Total expression=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller numbers, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing this as a geometric series and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we find that each layer E_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as E1, then the next one as E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression. Wait, actually, since it's nested, the innermost one is E1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...) around it. Let me try to write this down. Let me define E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving one layer out, E2 would be 1 + 3*E1, right? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Similarly, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression. But wait, looking back at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, the entire expression is 3*E9, where E9 is the 9th layer. So, to clarify, E1 = 1 + 3 E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 ... and so on, up to E9, and then the final answer is 3*E9. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each E from E1 to E9 step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, E2 is 1 + 3*E1, which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so E2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Moving on to E3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so E3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Now E4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so E4 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5: E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so E5 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6: E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Therefore, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7: E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Thus, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8: E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Therefore, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E9: E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, and 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from E1: 1+3=4, correct. E2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. E3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. E4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. E5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. E6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. E7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. E8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. E9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then each time we go outward, we add another layer. Since there are nine layers, I think I need to compute up to A\u2088. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

The first 3 is followed by the first (1 + 3(...).\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...).\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nLet me count the number of layers by the number of (1 + 3(...). Each time, it's a new layer. So, how many times does (1 + 3 appear? Let's see:\n\nFrom the original expression, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...\n3. And so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of closing parentheses. The entire expression ends with ))))))))). Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Starting from the end:\n\nThere are nine closing parentheses: ))))))))) So, that means there are nine layers of (1 + 3(...). Therefore, I need to compute A\u2080 up to A\u2088, which is nine terms, right? Because each (1 + 3(...) corresponds to a new A term. So, A\u2080 is the innermost, and A\u2088 is the outermost before the final 3 multiplication. So, that part seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to A\u2088, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that's the total value. Let me just make sure that I didn't miss any layers or count them incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The general form is A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, with A\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the terms I computed:\n\nA\u2080 = 4  \nA\u2081 = 13  \nA\u2082 = 40  \nA\u2083 = 121  \nA\u2084 = 364  \nA\u2085 = 1093  \nA\u2086 = 3280  \nA\u2087 = 9841  \nA\u2088 = 29524  \n\nLet me see if there's a pattern in the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, A_n = 3*A_{n-1} + 1.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the recurrence is A_n = 3*A_{n-1} + 1, with A\u2080 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is A_n - 3*A_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1  \nK - 3K = 1  \n-2K = 1  \nK = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is A_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition A\u2080 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 + (-1/2)  \n4 = C*1 - 1/2  \nC = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is A_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, A_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=0: (9*3^0 -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=2: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=3: (9*27 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=4: (9*81 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=5: (9*243 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=6: (9*729 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=7: (9*2187 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=8: (9*6561 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, A_n = (9*3^n -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, A\u2088 = (9*3^8 -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, A\u2088 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*A\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524  \n*    3  \n--------  \n29524 * 3:  \n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1  \n2*3=6 +1=7  \n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2  \n2*3=6 +2=8  \nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048  \n59048 + 29524:  \n59048 + 20000 = 79048  \n79048 + 9000 = 88048  \n88048 + 500 = 88548  \n88548 + 24 = 88572  \n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: the problem was to compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, by computing up to the eighth layer, we get A\u2088 = 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, we find that each term follows the pattern A\u2099 = (9*3\u207f - 1)/2. Calculating up to the eighth layer (A\u2088) gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but looking at the problem, it's actually 9 layers deep, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, actually, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524 * 3.

So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct.

Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. I think that's the right answer.

Hmm, that might be a good way to approach it. So, starting from Layer 1, which is the innermost, and then building up each layer step by step.\n\nOkay, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3  \nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nWe already know Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \nLayer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3)  \nLayer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4)  \nLayer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5)  \nLayer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6)  \nLayer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093.

Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nLayer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might be too broken down. Alternatively, 29524*3 can be computed as follows:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n---------  \nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.  \n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.  \nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 87572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524*3 should be 88572.

Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 2: 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 87572.

So, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did the digit-by-digit, I think I missed a digit.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, let's write it properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4  \n\u00d7        3  \n------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 =12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 87572. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, 3*(Layer 9) is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the computation of Layer 9 to ensure that I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nLayer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the addition when I added 29524 three times to get 88572.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048  \n59048 + 29524 = 88572  \nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I thought I got 87572, but that was a mistake. The correct result is 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors in the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

That seems manageable. So, let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\nStarting with a\u2081: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, a\u2082 = 13.\n\nNext, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, a\u2083 = 40.\n\nMoving on to a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, a\u2084 = 121.\n\nNow, a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364. So, a\u2085 = 364.\n\nNext, a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, a\u2086 = 1093.\n\nProceeding to a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, a\u2087 = 3280.\n\nMoving on to a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding them: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, a\u2088 = 9841.\n\nFinally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, a\u2089 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times a\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches what I got before. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a\u2089. Let me go back through each step.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few terms again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLet me recompute a\u2085: a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 + 1 is 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So, 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 =1 +3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089=1 +3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's another way to approach it, maybe a formula instead of computing each term step by step. The expression seems to follow a pattern where each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine terms, computing each step is manageable. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, 3*a_9=88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each term step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the entire expression manually, step by step, without using the formula, to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, all methods lead to the same result. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI wonder if there's a smarter way to see this without computing each term. Since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, and there are nine layers, it's essentially a geometric series with ratio 3, but starting from 1 and adding 3 each time.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. So, it's more like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and a constant term being added each time.\n\nBut regardless, since I've already computed it step by step and verified it with a formula, I think it's solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you go a layer out, you're effectively adding another power of 3, but scaled appropriately. But perhaps that's overcomplicating it.\n\nIn any case, I've checked it multiple ways and each time I get 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence \\( a_i \\) where each term is computed as follows:\n\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the outermost term by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so maybe it's 9 layers. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each step adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward, I can find the value of Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but maybe it's easier to compute directly.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such a long computation.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a miscalculation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, but given the time, breaking it down step by step seems more straightforward and less error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but given that the number of layers is 9, it might be easier to compute each step as I did before.\n\nBut just for fun, let me see if I can model this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this is correct. I can't spot any errors in the steps I took, and the formula confirms the values at each layer, so I'm confident in the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as a1.\n- Then the next layer out would be a2, built using a1.\n- This continues until a9, which is the outermost expression.\n\nBut actually, looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nSo, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. The next layer out is 1 + 3*(a1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this a2 = 13.\n\n3. The next layer is 1 + 3*(a2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, a3 = 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(a3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Thus, a4 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(a4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Therefore, a5 = 364.\n\n6. Then: 1 + 3*(a5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Thus, a6 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(a6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Therefore, a7 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(a7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Thus, a8 = 9841.\n\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(a8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Therefore, a9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(a9). So, we have to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet's calculate that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000,\n\n9000*3=27000,\n\n500*3=1500,\n\n20*3=60,\n\n4*3=12.\n\nWait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, just multiply 29524 by 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check all the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the multiplications and additions look correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem might be to recognize a pattern or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression that could have simplified the computation without having to calculate each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so a9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n1. The innermost expression is \\(1 + 3\\):\n   \\[ a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. The next layer is \\(1 + 3a_1\\):\n   \\[ a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " Let me assign each innermost expression a variable to make it easier. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each inner expression as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So actually, each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then moving outward. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let me count how many layers there are. Let me see: Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3  \n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of layer 1)  \n3. Next: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2)  \n... and this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3  \n2. 1+3(...)  \n3. 1+3(...)  \n... up to how many?\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). Since the innermost layer gave us 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from previous layer). The previous result was 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go step by step, maybe writing each layer as I compute it.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, then the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L1 is 1+3, L2 is 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, yes, after computing L9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3  \n2. 1+3(  \n3. 1+3(  \n4. 1+3(  \n5. 1+3(  \n6. 1+3(  \n7. 1+3(  \n8. 1+3(  \n9. 1+3(  \n10. 1+3\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, there's another (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nSo, how many times does the pattern 1+3( occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the initial 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(\n2. Then another (1+3(\n3. Another (1+3(\n4. Another (1+3(\n5. Another (1+3(\n6. Another (1+3(\n7. Another (1+3(\n8. Another (1+3(\n9. Then another (1+3\n\nWait, actually, the last one is (1+3), which is the innermost, so that's 9 layers in total. So, L1 to L9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that's 9 layers, with L9 being the innermost, and the outermost being 3*(L9). Wait, no, that's not correct because in the expression, each layer is nested inside the previous one, so the innermost is the last one. So, perhaps I misassigned L1 as the innermost, but in reality, the innermost is the last (1+3). So, perhaps I should have labeled the innermost as L1, then the next as L2, etc., up to L9 being the outermost. Wait, no, that's conflicting with my earlier approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. Let me take the expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to the outermost layer, which is 3*(...). So, if there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), then the outermost would be 3*(L9), where L9 is the ninth layer. Wait, but when I counted earlier, I had L1 as 1 + 3, L2 as 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9, which would then be the outermost, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(L9). So, perhaps I had nine layers, and then the final result is 3*(L9). So, when I computed L9 as 29524, then 3*29524 is the answer.\n\nWait, let me confirm that I have nine layers. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from L1 = 4, then L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7\u00a0 \u00a0 3  \n--------  \nLet me compute:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7\u00a0 \u00a0 3  \n--------  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7\u00a0 \u00a0 3  \n--------  \n3 * 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n3 * 5 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nYes, so 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first started, I thought of L1 as the innermost, but when I count the layers, I might have miscounted. Let me check again how many layers there are.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\n- After 3( comes (1+3(...), so that's the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...), which is the second layer.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1+3(...\n\nLayer 2: inside Layer 1, another (1+3(...)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, yes, nine layers in total, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L1 is the innermost (1 + 3), L2 is the next layer, up to L9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had L9 as 29,524, which is correct, and then the total expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me try to visualize the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears as a standalone term.\n\nWait, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, which would mean that L9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*(L9). Wait, that might not be the case because in the expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps the number of layers is 9, with the innermost being L9, and the outermost being 3*(L1), where L1 is the first layer after the initial 3.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now. Maybe it's better to think of it as a recursive expression. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K  \nK - 3K = 1  \n-2K = 1  \nK = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, each layer a_n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's a_1 = 4.\n\nThen each layer outwards is a_2, a_3, ..., up to a_9, since there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, so the outermost layer is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, so that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go through the layers again using the formula.\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3) terms:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3)\n3. (1+3)\n4. (1+3)\n5. (1+3)\n6. (1+3)\n7. (1+3)\n8. (1+3)\n9. (1+3)\n\nWait, that's nine (1+3) terms, each nested inside the previous one. So, each layer corresponds to one (1+3) term, so nine layers. Therefore, a_9 is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought of L1 as the innermost, which is correct, and then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one, up to L9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nYes, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to a geometric series. But in this case, since it's finite (nine layers), using the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of the expression as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it's a finite geometric series. However, given that it's nested, the recurrence approach is more suitable here.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost outwards.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 \\)\n- And so on, up to \\( L_9 \\)\n\nComputing each layer step by step:\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating the final result:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me assign a variable to each nested expression to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define E1 = 1 + 3  \nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1  \nE3 = 1 + 3*E2  \nAnd so on, up to E9, and then the total expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the outermost layer is 3 times the entire expression, so maybe I should adjust my variables accordingly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*...). So perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So maybe I should define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where each L is 3*(1 + L_next). Wait, but the innermost layer is just 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost part is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. Hmm, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, calculating each nested expression step by step.\n\nLet me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm moving one layer out, right? So each step, I take the result from the previous step and plug it into the next layer.\n\nSo, let me structure this:\n\nStart with the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) so each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in defining E1 to E9. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. The original problem is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each step is 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps the total number of layers is 9, each being 3*(1 + ...). Wait, let me check:\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, so that would mean 9 layers of nesting. So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So perhaps I should compute each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but wait, that's different from before. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), then the next is 3*(1 + previous result), etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by computing the innermost part, then each time moving outwards, each time computing 3*(1 + inner result).\n\nWait, let's try that approach. So:\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so maybe I need to multiply each result by 3 as I go outwards.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after computing all the inner layers up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count how many times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo that's nine layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each step again.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n3*29524:\n\n3*4=12, so 2 with carryover 1.\n\n3*2=6 +1=7.\n\n3*5=15, so 5 with carryover 1.\n\n3*9=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2.\n\n3*2=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers, let me recount the number of 3*(1 + ...) expressions.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...):\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" adds another opening parenthesis. So, starting from the first 3, the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...) is 9 times, because each layer adds another set. So, we have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, after computing the ninth layer, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nYes, so that's nine layers, and then one more multiplication by 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose the expression was 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that manually and see if my method works.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify using another approach, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Now, moving to Layer 2:\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3:\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4:\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 121? That's a nice number, but let me check: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yep, that's correct.\n\nMoving on to Layer 5:\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nOkay, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6:\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 1093. Let me verify: 3*364 is indeed 1092, plus 1 is 1093.

That looks good.\n\nFinally, Layer 9:\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: Let me compute that again to be sure. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go back and verify each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step checks out, so the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's another way to compute this, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me try solving it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 up to n=9, the final layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which again matches my previous result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step builds upon the previous one correctly, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be increasing by a factor of 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if this continues. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 = 3000, 93*3 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm the answer. Perhaps recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it that way. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives me 88572, confirming my earlier result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, resulting in the final value of 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form (1 + 3*(...)). There are nine layers, so we'll compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - **E1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **E2:** 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **E3:** 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **E4:** 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **E5:** 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **E6:** 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **E7:** 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **E8:** 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **E9:** 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by E9:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nSo, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nLayer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nLayer 3 = 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121.\n\nLayer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364.\n\nLayer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nLayer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nLayer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nLayer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523.

Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. \n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error with so many layers and large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15.

Each step seems to follow logically, and I double-checked each layer and the final multiplication. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

    "text": " Let me define each layer as follows: Let me call the innermost expression Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost layer. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) But wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so Layer 9 is multiplied by 3, not just part of the inner expressions. Hmm, maybe I should adjust my labeling to account for that. Let me think again. The entire expression is 3*(something), and that something is 1 + 3*(another something), and so on. So, perhaps the innermost part is the first Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which continues until the innermost part. So, perhaps the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would mean there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me confirm by counting the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. So, in the original expression, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). So, if I count the number of 1+3 parts, it's 9, right? Let me check: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis after the first 1+3 adds another layer. So, from the innermost, there are 8 more layers, making it 9 layers in total inside the outermost 3*(...). Wait, actually, maybe it's 9 layers including the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. Let me see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the innermost, which is the first 1+3, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, let's count: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is Layer 1, then each ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 1+3: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 1+3, there are 8 more opening parentheses, which means 8 more layers, making it a total of 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, down to Layer 1 being 1 + 3. So, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me start computing each layer one by one. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, 3*1093=3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3=29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then the outermost expression: 3*29524=88572. Let me verify 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " Let me define each inner expression as a variable to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define each layer as follows:\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost expression E1: 1 + 3\n- Then the next one out is E2: 1 + 3(E1)\n- Then E3: 1 + 3(E2)\n- And so on, up to E9: 1 + 3(E8)\n\nBut wait, actually, the entire expression is 3 times E9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, the structure is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*E8, and E8 is 1 + 3*E7, etc., down to E1 which is 1 + 3. Hmm, maybe that's a better way to think about it. So, if I compute E1 first, then use that to compute E2, then E3, and so on until E9, and then multiply by 3, that should give me the answer. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with E1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So E1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to E2: 1 + 3*(E1). Since E1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So E2 = 13.\n\nNext, E3: 1 + 3*(E2). E2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. E3 = 40.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*(E3). E3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. E4 = 121.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*(E4). E4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. So E5 = 364.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*(E5). E5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. E6 = 1093.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*(E6). E6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. So E7 = 3280.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*(E7). E7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. E8 = 9841.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*(E8). E8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. So E9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(E9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524*3:\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9. Let me go back a few steps.\n\nE8 was 9841, correct? Then E9 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern here. Each time, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E(n).\n\nLet me think. The recurrence is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving E(n) = 3*E(n-1), which has the solution E(n) = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition E(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. When n=1, E(1) should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, E(2) should be 13. Using the formula: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nE(3): (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have E9, which is n=9. So E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 \\)\n- \\( E_2 = 1 + 3E_1 \\)\n- \\( E_3 = 1 + 3E_2 \\)\n- \\( E_4 = 1 + 3E_3 \\)\n- \\( E_5 = 1 + 3E_4 \\)\n- \\( E_6 = 1 + 3E_5 \\)\n- \\( E_7 = 1 + 3E_6 \\)\n- \\( E_8 = 1 + 3E_7 \\)\n- \\( E_9 = 1 + 3E_8 \\)\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me assign each innermost expression a variable to make it easier. Let's say: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote the innermost expression as a0, then a1, a2, up to a8, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times something. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let me try that approach. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that's the next layer. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me keep going. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that. 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so total is 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240, so total is 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the steps I took. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the outermost layer, which was just multiplied by 3. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me define each part as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is A = 1 + 3. Then the next layer out would be B = 1 + 3A, then C = 1 + 3B, and so on, until I get to the outermost layer. Since there are nine layers, I might need to compute nine different expressions. But maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me avoid computing each one individually. Let me try computing the first few layers to see if I can spot a pattern. Starting with the innermost part: Layer 1: A = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 2: B = 1 + 3A = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, 13. Layer 3: C = 1 + 3B = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: D = 1 + 3C = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: E = 1 + 3D = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: F = 1 + 3E = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: G = 1 + 3F = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this outermost layer, so the total would be 3*I = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each layer again step by step. Starting from Layer 1: A = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: E = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: F = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then F = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: G = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then G = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: H = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then H = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: I = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then I = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*I = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me compute 29524 * 3 again. Maybe I should do it more carefully. 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me check with another method: 29,524 * 3 can be broken down as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 29524 * 3 was 88,572, but when I broke it down digit by digit, I got the same result. So, maybe that's correct after all. But let me just confirm once more. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 (next digit) * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 (next digit) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I did the initial layers, I ended up with I = 29,524, and then 3*I is 88,572. So, that's the final answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), which after computing all layers gives us 3*29524. But wait, when I computed each layer, starting from the innermost, I ended up with 29524, which is the value of the innermost expression up to the ninth layer. So, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, we have a_9 = 29524, as computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that aligns with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the next term.

So, E1 = 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) but wait, actually, since there are nine layers, E1 would be the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, right? Wait, no. Let me think again. The innermost expression is the last one: 1 + 3. Then moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's count them: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each time we go outward, we add another 1 + 3(...). So, let's count how many layers there are.

Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer computation because if I made a mistake in any layer, the final answer will be wrong. Let's go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that could be represented as a geometric series or something similar? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLet's denote E_n as the value of the nth layer. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for E_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, E_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another condition. The recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is E_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. So, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nWait, that seems odd because our initial terms are all integers. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to solve the recurrence step by step.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution E_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, E_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: E_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*E_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*E_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nLooking back, each E_n can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1.\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1.\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1.\n\nWait, that seems to be a pattern. So, E_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3^1 + 1.\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 up to 3^n.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3-1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches our earlier formula.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression.

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). That means Layer 9 is the innermost 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer is built by adding 1 and 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's define Layer 1 as the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.

Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121.

So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing all the layers up to Layer 1, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break this down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count them wrong. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, each starting with 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 3*(...) +1? No, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Then the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, the total layers inside are 9, each computed step by step. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first started, I thought the innermost was Layer 1, then built up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So, that gives me 88572. Let me verify each step again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But wait, let me check the multiplication step again because sometimes when numbers get big, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the parentheses. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)) inside each other, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3)\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). Therefore, each layer corresponds to one of these, so I correctly calculated up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I should check the pattern another way. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}.\n\nWait, actually, no, because each layer is built from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost, a1 = 1 + 3, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a9, and then the outermost is 3*a9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had Layer 1 as the innermost, which was a1 = 4, then a2 = 13, up to a9 = 29524, then the outermost is 3*a9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from a1 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, etc.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, since we're starting from the innermost, which is a1 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9. So, it's a linear recurrence.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when we set a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step without using the formula to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost outward, we compute each step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
