    "text": " Let's number them from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, the innermost is the last one, so maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving outward, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. So 300 + 60 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. It's a pretty big number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication and addition, it makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step sequentially.

    "text": " Let me assign variables to each layer to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let\u2019s define L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3\n- Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n- L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n- And so on, until L9, which will be the outermost expression.\n\nWait, actually, the problem has 9 sets of parentheses, so maybe I need to compute 9 layers? Let me check. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Hmm, perhaps 9 layers? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nSo, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...).

The outermost 3*(...), which would be layer 10? Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(layer9). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Each time, we have a term that's 1 + 3*(next term). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, and then each layer is built upon that. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. So, let's start with the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the expression is finite and not infinite, working step by step seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolve for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(L9), where L9 is as above.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and a general formula for the nth layer is derived using a recurrence relation. Applying this formula, the final result is computed.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are 9 such layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me write this down.\n\nFirst, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me calculate that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093. So 3*1093 is... 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let's compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523. So 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 29524 is actually 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, and 24*3 is 72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and each time substituting the value of the previous layer into the next one. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives us 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer, but just to make sure, maybe I can check my calculations for each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything checks out.

    "text": " Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4? Wait, no, hold on. The innermost part is actually just 1 + 3, but that's not quite right because in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this by starting at the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So on until Layer 9. Wait, but in the original problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me write them down:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do this step by step. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLet me recount each layer carefully:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Thus, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, but that's not the right way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572. Wait, but I want to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me verify 3*29524 another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. I computed each layer correctly, right? Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, I could model this as a geometric series, but let me see if that's possible.\n\nLet me consider the expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the general formula approach, and both lead to the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern which can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(next layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each layer seems to be increasing by a factor of 3 and adding 1 each time. Let me write this down more clearly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid any mistakes. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me break it down digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7 and carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is the number. Let me write it out:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me verify using another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572 is the final result. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that formula. For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But wait, our a_1 is 4. Hmm, so maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps it's a_n = 3^{n} + 1. Let me test it.\n\nWait, for n=1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. If I use the formula a_n = 3^{n} + 1, then a_1 = 3 +1 =4. Correct.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. Using the formula, a_2 = 3^2 + 1 = 9 +1 =10. Wait, that's not correct because a_2 is 13, not 10. So, that formula doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe it's a geometric series. Let me try to express the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = k*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve it properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I computed earlier by expanding each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048.\n\n59048 /2=29524.\n\n29524 *3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 3*29524. Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, all the steps check out. I think I did this correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next. Starting with the innermost layer and moving outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems manageable. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next, Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093=3279. Then Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280=9840. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1. I'll go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each layer builds upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and I carried out each arithmetic operation step by step. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, leading to the final result.\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) = \\boxed{88572}$"

Then, L2: 1 + 3*(L1). Then L3: 1 + 3*(L2), and so on, up to L9: 1 + 3*(L8), and finally, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Hmm, that seems manageable. So, if I can compute each L from L1 to L9, I can then multiply the final result by 3 to get the answer. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, moving to L2: L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so L2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to L3: L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so L3 = 1 + 39 = 40. So far, so good. Now, L4: L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so L4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each L seems to be following a specific sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern to make this easier instead of computing each step manually, especially since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, let me check if I'm correct so far. L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121. Let me verify L4 again: 1 + 3*40 is indeed 121. Okay, moving on. L5: L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so L5 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6: L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7: L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8: L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9: L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I might have made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me verify each step again.\n\nStarting from L1 to L9:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nHmm, same result. So, unless I made a mistake in the initial steps, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the closed-form formula works. Therefore, L9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check: 3^{n+1} for n=9 is 3^{10}=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 in another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000.\n\n9000*3=27000.\n\n500*3=1500.\n\n20*3=60.\n\n4*3=12.\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n(4*3)=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n(2*3)=6 +1=7.\n\n(5*3)=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n(2*3)=6 +2=8.\n\n(9*3)=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n(5*3)=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n(2*3)=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing down the digits from right to left:\n\n2 (from 4*3=12)\n\n7 (from 2*3=6 +1=7)\n\n5 (from 5*3=15)\n\n8 (from 9*3=27 +1=28)\n\n8 (from 2*3=6 +2=8)\n\n7 (from 9*3=27 +2=29, wait, no, wait, let me correct this.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) =7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit:5 * 3 =15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9 *3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: (since there are no more digits) 0*3=0 +2 (carryover from previous digit, but wait, 2 was from 9*3 +1, so actually, after 2*3 +2, we had 8, so no carryover beyond that.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the fifth digit, we're done. So, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\) where each \\( L_i \\) is computed as \\( 1 + 3 \\times L_{i-1} \\) starting from \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\).\n\n1.

Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nI can break this down: 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this problem has nine layers. Let me think if there's a way to represent this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. Let's try to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, using this formula, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier result.\n\nWait, so another way to compute the entire expression is to recognize it as (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88,572.\n\nSo, that's a quicker way without computing each layer step by step. But since I was able to derive the formula, that's a good learning point for similar problems in the future.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or recognizing the pattern and deriving a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recursive formula. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3, the final result is \\( 88,572 \\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost layer and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, the innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3. Let me check that again. The innermost parentheses would be the last one: (1 + 3). Then moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times the next layer. So, let's list them from innermost to outermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)  \nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2)  \nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3)  \nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4)  \n... and so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right way to think about it. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3*(Layer 1). So Layer 2: 3*(4) = 12. Then, the next layer is 1 + Layer 2, so Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13. Then, Layer 4 is 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39. Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 6: 3*40 = 120. Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 8: 3*121 = 363. Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364. Let me check if I did that correctly. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me go through it again more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this level 1.\n\n2. Moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(level 1). So that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this level 2.\n\n3. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5.\n\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7.\n\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8.\n\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Level 9.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So after computing up to level 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. So 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I counted the levels correctly. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). So each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n3. (1 + 12) = 13\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n5. (1 + 39) = 40\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n7. (1 + 120) = 121\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n9. (1 + 363) = 364\n10. 3*(364) = 1092\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. 3*(1093) = 3279\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. 3*(3280) = 9840\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. 3*(9841) = 29523\n17. (1 + 29523) = 29524\n18. Finally, 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like 18 steps, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps there are 8 layers inside the initial 3(...). Let me try another approach: Let me denote each nested part as a function. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3. So f(1) = 4. Then f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. But how many layers do we have here? The original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), so n=9. Then f(9) would be the innermost part before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So if I have 9 layers, then f(9) would be the value inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me compute f(n) step by step:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4  \nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nSo after computing up to f(9), which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7  \n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8  \n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me check this multiplication another way to be sure. Let's break down 29524:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4  \nSo 3*20000 = 60000  \n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n3*20 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560  \n3*4 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f  \n\nSo yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is building upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth in the values. It's interesting how each step contributes to the next, and it's crucial to compute each layer correctly to avoid mistakes. I don't see any errors in my calculations now, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with (1 + 3) and working up through each subsequent layer, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 as needed. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer:**\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3, well, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I can also think about whether there's a formula or a pattern that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: L_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have a system of two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Let me subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2 = -0.5. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 0.5 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have Layer 9, let's compute that: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without manually calculating each layer. That was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations. I think this solidifies my understanding of how these nested expressions work. It's interesting how the same result can be achieved both by iterative computation and by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. I might have to remember this approach for future problems that involve similar nested structures. It's also a good reminder of the power of mathematical patterns and formulas in simplifying complex-looking problems.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me number them from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, let's compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That was easy. \n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, and 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 = 9000, and 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 = 27000, and 3*841 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit high, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, seems consistent. Now, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. \n\nBreaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because that's a big number. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the earlier layers which affects all subsequent calculations. Let me go through each layer again very carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMultiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time I check. So, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more generally.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer manually, then double-checked each step, and then even derived a general formula to confirm the result. It seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer up to the ninth, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from L1: L1 = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Wait, no, that's the entire expression. Hmm, maybe I should think of each step as a recursive computation. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let's start by computing the innermost parentheses first. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me check: The innermost parentheses are in the middle of all those layers. Wait, maybe I should count how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: Each time it's 3(1 + 3(...)), so starting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s before I get to the innermost 1 + 3. Let me see: The entire expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...).

Each time I have 3(1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let's see: The first layer is 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)).

Continuing this, up to the innermost layer, which is layer 9.\n\nWait, because from the expression, each time after 3, it's (1 + 3(...)), and this repeats 8 times before the innermost (1 + 3). Let me check: The entire expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside that, each time, another 3(1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is 9, starting from the outermost 3 as layer 1, down to the innermost as layer 9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outward. So, let's consider the innermost part first.\n\nLet me try to compute the innermost expression first, which is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from the innermost layer). So, let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nSo:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(L9). So, the total value would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from L1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until L9. Then the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So, the total would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let me compute 30000*3=90000, subtract 476*3 because 30000 - 476 = 29524. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's incorrect because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1. So, 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 = 29524. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n- This continues until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time there's a \"(\", which corresponds to a new layer.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3. Each \"(\" starts a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first \"(\", then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) - The first \"(\" after 3 is the start of L1.\n\nThen inside that, another \"(\", which is L2.\n\nContinuing, each \"(\" adds a new layer until the innermost, which is L9.\n\nWait, so the number of layers is 9, right? Because each \"(\" after the first 3 adds a new layer, and there are 9 \"(\" in total. Let me count the number of \"(\":\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1+3(...)), so the first \"(\" is after the 3, then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. After the first 3: \"(\" \u2192 L1\n2. Inside that: \"(\" \u2192 L2\n3. Inside L2: \"(\" \u2192 L3\n4. Inside L3: \"(\" \u2192 L4\n5. Inside L4: \"(\" \u2192 L5\n6. Inside L5: \"(\" \u2192 L6\n7. Inside L6: \"(\" \u2192 L7\n8. Inside L7: \"(\" \u2192 L8\n9. Inside L8: \"(\" \u2192 L9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, from L1 to L9. Therefore, my earlier calculation up to L9 is correct, and the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say I have a similar expression but with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nLet me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nDirect computation: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds for smaller numbers, which gives me confidence that my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections. Each time after a \"3(\", there's a \"1 + 3(\" except for the innermost one.\n\nWait, starting from the first 3, it's followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is one layer. Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, the number of layers is 9 because each \"3(\" introduces a new layer, and there are 9 \"3(\" after the initial 3. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to count the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)\n2. Inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many \"3(\" are there? Let me count each occurrence:\n\n1. The first 3( after the initial 3.\n2. Then another 3( inside that.\n3. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"(\" corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting after the initial 3, each \"(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"(\" after the initial 3 is 9. Therefore, there are 9 layers, from L1 to L9.\n\nThus, my calculation up to L9 is correct, and the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation, but given the small number of layers, computing each step manually is manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation of L9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. It has 9 layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) and working outward.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1 (L1):** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2 (L2):** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3 (L3):** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4 (L4):** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5 (L5):** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6 (L6):** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7 (L7):** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8 (L8):** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9 (L9):** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the Outermost Layer:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost layer. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So let me start there. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, that 4 is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let me create a table or something to keep track. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so actually, the first layer is the innermost, and the outermost is Layer 9 multiplied by 3. Let me make sure I get the layers right. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, Layer 4 is 121, Layer 5 is 364, Layer 6 is 1093, Layer 7 is 3280, Layer 8 is 9841, Layer 9 is 29524.

The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the first layer is 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on until the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2, and so on, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's already over a thousand. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.

    "text": " Let's number them from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer2\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer4\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer5)\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer6\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer7)\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer8\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, that seems like 10 layers, but the original expression only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is the innermost, that's one layer. Then each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3(...). So, counting each opening parenthesis as a new layer, starting from the inside:\n\n1. (1 + 3) - Layer 1\n2. 3*(Layer1) inside another (1 + ...) - Layer 2\n3. 3*(Layer2) inside another (1 + ...) - Layer3\n...\nContinuing this, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so each time we have a new set of parentheses. So, starting from the first ( after 1+, that's Layer1, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) - Layer1\n2. 3*(Layer1) inside (1 + ...) - Layer2\n3. 3*(Layer2) inside (1 + ...) - Layer3\n4. 3*(Layer3) inside (1 + ...) - Layer4\n5. 3*(Layer4) inside (1 + ...) - Layer5\n6. 3*(Layer5) inside (1 + ...) - Layer6\n7. 3*(Layer6) inside (1 + ...) - Layer7\n8. 3*(Layer7) inside (1 + ...) - Layer8\n9. 3*(Layer8) inside (1 + ...) - Layer9\n10. 3*(Layer9) - which is the outermost 3(...)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the outermost is 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is (1 + 3*(Layer8)), etc., down to Layer1 being (1 + 3). So, to compute this, I need to compute Layer1 first, then Layer2 using Layer1, and so on up to Layer9, then multiply by 3 for the outermost layer. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. So, Layer1 = 4.\n\nThen Layer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12. Then Layer2 is 12, but wait, Layer2 is inside another (1 + ...). Wait, no, Layer2 is the result of 3*(Layer1), but Layer2 itself is part of Layer3. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each Layer n is computed as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Because each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer2 is (1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3 is (1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n= ?\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 *3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something recursive.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, LHS = A*3^{n} + B\n\nRHS = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the innermost layer is Layer1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, Layer2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches.\n\nSo, Layer9: n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've got it right. The key was to recognize the pattern and use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which made the calculation much easier than computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for each layer n, and then plugging in n=9, I arrived at the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we recognize a repeating pattern and use a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution. Each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to the general solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me assign each innermost expression a variable to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- A = 1 + 3\n- Then, B = 1 + 3A\n- Then, C = 1 + 3B\n- And so on, up to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but actually, looking back, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Then: (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, perhaps each layer builds upon the previous one by adding another 3(...). Let me try computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me write each step down:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3)\n   - That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n   - So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4.

Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8.

Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers I actually have. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so maybe I went one step too far. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another set. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n- Then, moving out, each time we add another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer corresponds to each set of parentheses. Since there are 9 sets, I think I have 9 layers to compute, each time moving outward. But in my earlier steps, I went up to step 9, which might be correct. Wait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...), so each layer is a new set. Let me count the number of times I have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer. So, how many layers? Let me see: the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, I think I have 9 layers to compute, each time adding another 3*(previous result). Therefore, my steps 1 through 9 should correspond to each layer, with step 1 being the innermost, and step 9 being the outermost. But wait, when I computed up to step 9, I got 29524, but then the entire expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, I have to multiply the result by 3. Wait, no, actually, the way the expression is structured is that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost, and each time, the result is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after computing all 9 layers, I would have the innermost result, but actually, I think I might have miscounted. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). Therefore, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nI can break this down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\n= (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error, especially with such large numbers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n(4 \u00d7 3) = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n(2 \u00d7 3) + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n(5 \u00d7 3) = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n(9 \u00d7 3) + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n(2 \u00d7 3) + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\nSo, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3\n= (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3\n= 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3)\n= 90,000 - 1,428\n= 88,572\n\nYes, same result. So, I'm confident that 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, with layer 1 being the innermost and layer 9 being the outermost. So, layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) ... and so on, up to layer 9. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Since layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, layer 2 is 13. Moving on to layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364. Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3*(layer 9). Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute 29524*3. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. So, putting it all together, 29524*3 is 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carrying over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So yes, 29524*3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the steps. Let me go back through each layer and verify the computations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps check out. So, the final answer should be 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, resulting in the final value of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.

Calculating 3*364: 364*3, let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Let me assign a variable to each layer to make it easier. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let\u2019s define Layer 1 as the innermost part: 1 + 3\n- Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- And so on, until Layer 9, which would be the outermost layer, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1.\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3  \nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nSince Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \nLayer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3)  \nLayer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4)  \nLayer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5)  \nLayer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6)  \nLayer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7)  \nLayer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nLayer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let me compute that. 9841 * 3. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. So, Layer 9 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 24*3 is 72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 72 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 is 59,048, plus another 29,524 is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Layer 1: 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n- Layer 4: 121\n- Layer 5: 364\n- Layer 6: 1093\n- Layer 7: 3280\n- Layer 8: 9841\n- Layer 9: 29,524\n- Final result: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer is built by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a geometric progression. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. \n\nActually, this looks similar to a geometric series where each term is defined recursively. The general form is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. If a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4, then:\n\na(1) = 4  \na(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \na(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n... and so on.\n\nIf I use the formula a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, let's test it for n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be a(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, that checks out. Then the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've done each step correctly, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a few layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my earlier calculations.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nFinal result: 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. There's a method to this madness, even though it looks intimidating at first. By breaking it down into layers and recognizing the pattern, it becomes manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you're effectively building a number in base 3, but that might be overcomplicating it. The key insight here was recognizing the recursive structure and using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which confirmed the step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I arrived at the solution of 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. We define each layer as follows:\n\n- **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n\n- \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, Layer 1 is actually the innermost, so it's 1 + 3, but then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on. Hmm, maybe I should define each layer in terms of the previous one. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Let L1 = 1 + 3 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... and so on, up to L9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*L9. That seems manageable. So, I can compute each L from L1 to L9 step by step. Let me start calculating each layer one by one. Starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let me continue.

Let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process. I notice that each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me explore that. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = B, where B is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence relation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier values to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost layer. Wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by something. That something is 1 plus 3 times another expression, which is similar. So, perhaps I should consider each step as starting from the innermost part and moving outward, computing each value step by step. Let me try that approach. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that's the first layer. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second layer is 13. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Fourth layer is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121: Let me compute 120*3=360, plus 3=363. So, 3*121=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Fifth layer is 364. Moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer is 3280. Moving outward, next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Ninth layer is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this ninth layer result. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let me break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when you do a lot of multiplications and additions, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each step quickly. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. So, I think my calculation is correct.

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. Let me try to write this step by step. Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from innermost)). So, the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer is 13. Now, the next layer out is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check if that's the case. Let me write down the results so far:\n\n- Layer 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4\n- Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n- Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nYes, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer, Layer 4, would be (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n- Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n- Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to Layer 9. So, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, the final result after computing Layer 9 would be 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 3*20000 = 60000. 3*9000 = 27000. 3*500 = 1500. 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572. Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly. Let's see: 29524*3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've accounted for all the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(previous)). So, there are 9 layers in total. So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could represent this. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = 4.\n\nn=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nn=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on up to n=9: a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see if I can derive it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since in this problem, there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step is manageable, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm it's 177147.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations earlier, let me recompute the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3, so the sum would be a geometric series. But in this case, each layer is built upon the previous one, so it's more of a recursive sequence rather than a sum of a series.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step approach and the formula both lead me to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nI think I've considered this problem from multiple angles: computing each layer step by step, deriving a closed-form formula, and verifying the calculations through different methods. All paths lead to the same conclusion, so I don't think I've made any mistakes here. It's a bit time-consuming, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent errors.\n\nAnother thing I could do to verify is to compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. For example, if I have just one layer: 3(1 + 3). That would be 3*(4)=12. Using the formula, n=1: a_1=4, then 3*a_1=12. Correct.\n\nWith two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute it: Innermost is 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 3*13=39. Using the formula, a_2=13, then 3*a_2=39. Correct.\n\nWith three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost is 4, then 13, then 40. Then 3*40=120. Using the formula, a_3=40, 3*a_3=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger case with nine layers.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and multiply the final layer by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 88,572. But when I added 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72, I got 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the earlier step-by-step, I thought of 3*29524 as 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24. Let me verify that:\n\n3*20000 = 60,000\n\n3*9000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because each layer seems to be increasing by a factor, but maybe that's just how it is. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n} + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, k is 3, and c is 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^n + 1/(1 - 3).\n\nSimplifying, 1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (a_1 - (-1/2))*(3)^n + (-1/2).\n\nBut wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, plugging in a_1 = 4:\n\na_n = (4 - (-1/2))*(3)^n + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^n - 1/2 = (9/2)*(3)^n - 1/2.\n\nWait, but this seems different from what we computed earlier. Let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (9/2)*(3)^1 - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. But wait, that's not correct because a_1 is 4, not 13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the indices. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, n starts at 1.\n\nWait, maybe the formula should be adjusted for the starting index. Let me try to derive it properly.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n - 1} + c/(1 - k).\n\nSo, in this case, k = 3, c = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n - 1} + 1/(1 - 3).\n\nCompute 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n - 1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n - 1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n - 1} - 1/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_1 using this formula:\n\na_1 = (9/2) * 3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\na_3 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = (9/2)*81 - 1/2 = 729/2 - 1/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = (9/2)*243 - 1/2 = 2187/2 - 1/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = (9/2)*729 - 1/2 = 6561/2 - 1/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = (9/2)*2187 - 1/2 = 19683/2 - 1/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = 29524, which is the same as what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I was expecting maybe a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a different formula, but it seems that computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation both lead to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps the general form is a sum of a geometric series plus some term.\n\nWait, let me try to express a_n in terms of a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so maybe a_0 = 1? Let me check:\n\nIf a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, and a_1 = 4, then 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nThen, the solution would be a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - k)) * k^n + c/(1 - k).\n\nWait, but earlier I had a different formula because I started at n=1. Let me adjust for a_0 = 1.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - k)) * k^n + c/(1 - k).\n\nHere, c=1, k=3, a_0=1.\n\nSo, a_n = (1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n + 1/(1 - 3).\n\nCompute 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (1 - (-1/2)) * 3^n + (-1/2) = (1 + 1/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nWait, let's test this for n=0: a_0 = (3^{1}/2) - 1/2 = 3/2 - 1/2 = 2/2 = 1. Correct.\n\nn=1: a_1 = (3^2/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4/2) - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the layers again in a different way, perhaps using a table.\n\nLet me list each layer from 1 to 9 with their corresponding a_n:\n\nLayer 1 (n=1): a1 = 4\n\nLayer 2 (n=2): a2 = 13\n\nLayer 3 (n=3): a3 =40\n\nLayer 4 (n=4): a4=121\n\nLayer 5 (n=5): a5=364\n\nLayer 6 (n=6): a6=1093\n\nLayer 7 (n=7): a7=3280\n\nLayer 8 (n=8): a8=9841\n\nLayer 9 (n=9): a9=29524\n\nThen, 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, perhaps the sum can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let me check.\n\nWait, for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 =1. But a1=4, so that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in our earlier formula, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2, which can be written as (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's another way to look at it.\n\nSo, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can express the result as (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm absolutely sure now that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Now, Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(layer 1)). Wait, that might not be the best way to assign layers.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original problem is 3 times the outermost layer. So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because each step seems correct, but the number is quite large. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this. The structure of the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. This kind of recursive structure might be similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed in terms of powers of 3. Let me try to represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the outermost expression is 3*f(9). So, if I can find a closed-form expression for f(n), that would save time. Let's see if I can find a pattern or derive a formula for f(n). Let's compute the first few terms: f(1) = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general form of such a recurrence is f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to this kind of recurrence is f(n) = (f(1) - b/(1 - a)) * a^{n-1} + b/(1 - a). Wait, but since a \u2260 1, we can use this formula. Let me plug in the values. Here, f(1) = 4, a = 3, b = 1. So, the solution would be f(n) = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let me compute 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, f(n) = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9 * 3^{n-1}) / 2. So, f(n) = (9 * 3^{n-1}) / 2 - 1/2 = (9 * 3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (9*9 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, f(n) = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Now, for n=9, f(9) = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, 9*6561= let's compute that. 6561*9: 6000*9=54,000; 500*9=4,500; 60*9=540; 1*9=9. Adding up: 54,000 +4,500=58,500; +540=59,040; +9=59,049. So, 9*6561=59,049. Then, 59,049 -1=59,048. Then, 59,048 /2=29,524. So, f(9)=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29,524=88,572. So, that matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with such large numbers. Let me verify 3^8 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. Correct. Then, 9*6561: 6561*9. Let me compute it digit by digit: 6561 * 9. 1*9=9, 6*9=54, 5*9=45, 6*9=54. So, writing it out: 6561 *9: 1*9=9, 6*9=54 (carryover 5), 5*9=45 +5=50 (carryover 5), 6*9=54 +5=59. So, the result is 59,049. Then, 59,049 -1=59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Then, 3*29,524: 29,524*3. Let me compute 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29,524 *3=88,572. Correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, a recursive formula is derived, leading to a closed-form solution. The final result is computed as 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscalculated the last step because 29,524 * 3.

So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that each layer is being multiplied by 3, but I'm not sure if I accounted for all the layers correctly. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of (1 + 3(...)), right? So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer1)), and so on until Layer 9, which is (1 + 3*(Layer8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is built as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, that seems like each layer is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... up to a certain number of terms.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nWait a minute, so each layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression again step by step, just to catch any possible arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.

Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd this goes on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1 is the innermost, so that's 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving out to Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. That's 1 + 120, which is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... Wait, 841*3: 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3, so 2400 + 120 is 2520, plus 3 is 2523. So, 3*9841 is 27000 + 2523, which is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that computation because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 step by step. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- There's a 2 at the beginning, 2*3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nPutting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2, which is 688572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is actually 88572, not 688572. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit places. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from the 2*3 + carryover), then 8 (from 9*3 + carryover), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carryover), then 2 (from 4*3). So, the number is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number, but considering each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, it might be correct. Let me go through each layer again quickly to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but in the problem, it's 3 times (Layer 9). Hmm, so perhaps I need to compute Layer 1 first, then use that result in Layer 2, and so on, until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply the whole thing by 3. That sounds like a plan. Let me start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 equals 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seemed correct. Let me verify a couple of layers to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident about this solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me assign each innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, with the outermost being Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, the innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3. Let me check: The innermost is the last (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times the next layer. Let me try to write this out step by step. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 and then multiply the result by 3. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So, putting it all together: 27,8,5,7,2. Wait, that can't be right. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I might have made a mistake in the placement of the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, so write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000, then subtract (30000 - 29524) \u00d7 3. Wait, that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.

So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A\u00d73^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1).\n\nSo, A\u00d73^n + B = 1 + 3\u00d7(A\u00d73^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3\u00d7A\u00d73^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A\u00d73^n + 3B.\n\nSo, A\u00d73^n + B = A\u00d73^n + 3B + 1.\n\nSubtract A\u00d73^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1.\n\nSo, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nL(1) = A\u00d73^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7Layer9 = 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3\u00d7(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me start by computing Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was simple. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.

Hmm, I'm noticing that each layer is getting significantly larger. Let me keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Wow, this is getting big. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 3*29524. Let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I did it right. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I don't see any errors in my steps, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Starting with layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, moving to layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a big number. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Let me verify 29524*3: 29524*3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each into the next layer until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting, that's a nice round number. Let's see Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, so far, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me keep going. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time we have a new set of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1 + 3. Hmm, the expression is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first layer is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1)\n- Then, moving out, each time we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1 + 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. From the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).

It's easy to make a mistake with all these layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. This expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might also help, but in this case, since each term depends on the previous one multiplied by 3 and adding 1, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Maybe not necessary, since the step-by-step computation and the recurrence both give the same answer.\n\nLet me just verify once more that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to explore another angle, let's consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous). So, this is similar to building a number where each digit is 1 in base 3, but multiplied by 3 each time. Hmm, maybe not exactly, but it's an interesting thought.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Since there are nine layers, it's like a geometric series with a ratio of 3, but with each term being 1. Let me see if that can be modeled as a geometric series.\n\nWait, a geometric series is typically a sum of terms where each term is a constant ratio times the previous one. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is more like a recurrence relation rather than a simple sum. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence solution we found earlier.\n\nIn any case, both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach lead to the same result, so I feel confident about the answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is essentially a term in a sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. So, if we let a_n be the value at the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, as we did before. This kind of recursive formula is pretty common, and solving it gives us a closed-form expression, which we did.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. I've computed it step by step, solved the recurrence, and even thought about alternative approaches like geometric series and base representations, though the latter didn't quite fit. All methods point to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3. Let me verify that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nWait, hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost, do I need to multiply it by 3 and then continue outward? Hmm, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start counting from the innermost as Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer is one more step outward. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, the next is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which would be Layer 2. So, the total number of layers is 9, as there are nine sets of parentheses. Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think my earlier calculation is correct, where Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If Layer 1 is (1 + 3), then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9, which is the innermost. But in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so perhaps I need to compute each layer correctly, starting from the innermost, and then work my way outwards, multiplying each time by 3 and adding 1. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me try to compute each step as I go from the inside out.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4  \n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13  \n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40  \n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121  \n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364  \n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me calculate 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7        3  \n__________  \nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.  \n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7        3  \n__________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0  \n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo yes, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have miscalculated the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13  \n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40  \n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121  \n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364  \n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093  \n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280  \n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841  \n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524  \n\nSo, that's nine layers, each time computing the next layer by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should compute each layer again step by step, because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with such large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication again carefully.\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7        3  \n__________  \nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.  \n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 29,524 * 3 in another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3  \n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3  \n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12  \nNow, adding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's see: starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)  \n2. 1 + 3*(...)  \n3. 1 + 3*(...)  \n... up to 9 times, as I thought earlier. So, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, Layer 9 is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nEach layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D  \nD - 3D = 1  \n-2D = 1  \nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me test it for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nBecause n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result using a different method, which is always reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nEach time, the term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I expand the expression, it might form a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nBut given that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), and each inner term is 1 + 3*(...), it might not directly form a geometric series, but perhaps a sum over multiple terms.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, but I think the recurrence relation approach was more straightforward in this case.\n\nIn any case, both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(29,524) once more, because sometimes even if the individual steps are correct, a simple multiplication mistake can happen.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000  \n9,000 * 3 = 27,000  \n500 * 3 = 1,500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000  \n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500  \n88,500 + 60 = 88,560  \n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.

Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(result from layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, moving to layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result from layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, layer 2 is 13. Now, layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 = 360, and 1*3 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result from layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(result from layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(result from layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": " Let's call the innermost expression Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, then multiply the result by 3, I'll have the answer. Let me start computing each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Layer 1 equals 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 first, which is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. Wait, 9841 is 9000 + 841, so 3*9841 = 3*(9000 + 841) = 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*524 = 1572. Wait, actually, it's easier to compute 29524*3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carry over 2; 0*3=0 +2=2; 0*3=0. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n   29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit from right to left:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nThere are no more digits, but the carry over 2 would be added as the next digit, but since it's the leftmost, it's just 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524*3 should be:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nThe next digit is the ten-thousands place: 2*3=6, but since we're at the end, it's just 6.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check: 29524*3.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 30000*3=90000, subtract 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428=88572. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is less than 30000. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. But I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n\nWait, but actually, the expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), so the first layer is the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), which is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost out, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, which equals 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Wait, actually, the expression given has nine layers, starting from 1+3 and building up. Let me check: Each time, we're adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1).

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure of the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). This resembles a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nEach layer can be seen as a term in a geometric sequence. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which also matches.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write down the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n \u2265 2, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, since the original problem has nine layers, that would correspond to n=9.\n\nWait, but in our initial definition, a_1 was the innermost layer, which is 1+3, so the outermost layer would be a_9. So, the outermost expression is a_9, and the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute a_9 using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nBecause n=9, so 3^{9+1}=3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049. Then, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this is correct. Both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Calculating up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term.

    "text": " Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up to the final answer. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Therefore, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with such large numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me confirm this multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first. 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So, adding those: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, plus 1000 is 59000, plus 40 is 59040, plus 8 is 59048. Now, adding the third 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524. Let's break it down: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 40 + 20 = 60, 8 + 4 = 12. Adding those: 70000 + 18000 = 88000, plus 1000 is 89000, plus 60 is 89060, plus 12 is 89072. Wait, that doesn't match the previous result. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the addition? Let me check again. Maybe I should add them digit by digit. Let's write it out:\n\n    29524\n  +29524\n  -------\n    59048\n\nThen, 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 + 4 = 8\n8 + 2 = 10, carryover 1\n4 + 5 + 1 = 10, carryover 1\n0 + 9 + 1 = 10, carryover 1\n9 + 2 + 1 = 12, carryover 1\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me write it properly:\n\n      59048\n    +29524\n    ---------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carryover 1\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8\nThere's no more digits, so the carryover 1 is written down.\n\nWait, that gives 88572. Oh, I think I messed up the addition earlier. Let me do it step by step:\n\nAdding 59048 and 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n4 + 2 = 6, plus carryover 1 is 7, write down 7\n0 + 5 = 5, write down 5\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carryover 1\n5 + 2 = 7, plus carryover 1 is 8, write down 8\nNo more digits, so the carryover 1 is written down at the beginning.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Wait, but when I did it before, I thought it was 89072, but that was incorrect. So, the correct sum is 88572, which matches my initial calculation. So, the final result is indeed 88572. Therefore, I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication; my second method was flawed because I incorrectly added the numbers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. So, to compute this, I should start by calculating Layer 1, then Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and keep going until I reach Layer 9, then multiply the whole thing by 3. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... Let me calculate that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.

Wait, hold on, that might not be the right breakdown. Let me try another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which propagates outward.

So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, manually computing each layer seems manageable. However, for someone who might be more advanced, recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression could be a quicker way. Let me explore that idea as well, just to confirm.\n\nLooking at the structure, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWith Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. However, in this case, the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, so we can find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4.\n\nLayer 1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both the iterative method and the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, it's a bit more involved because each term is built upon the previous one, so it's not a straightforward geometric series. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem layer by layer and verifying each step, I was able to compute the value of the expression. Additionally, recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula, which confirmed the result. This dual approach gives me confidence that the answer is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."
