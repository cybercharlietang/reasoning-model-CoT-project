    "text": " Let me number the innermost parentheses as layer 1, then the next one as layer 2, and so on up to layer 9, with the outermost being layer 9. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is 3 times (1 + 3(layer 1)). Layer 3 is 3 times (1 + 3(layer 2)), and so on. Wait, no, actually, each layer is inside another, so perhaps layer 1 is the innermost, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, layer 2 would be 3*(1 + layer1). So, let's compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer2_inner). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + the result of the inner layer). Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nWait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + ...). So, each layer is 3*(1 + inner layer). So, perhaps starting from the innermost:\n\nStart with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nWait, but hold on, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But wait, is that accurate?\n\nWait, let me clarify the structure. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 3*(1 + L1)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because each layer is 3*(1 + the inner layer). So, L1 is the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nWait, but hold on, let me count how many layers we're processing here. Each time I go out one layer, I'm processing another multiplication. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that starting from the innermost, each time I add a layer, I have another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) and each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), then each time another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, from the original problem, I can see that after the initial 3(1+3, there are 8 more layers. So, total layers from innermost to outermost would be 9. Wait, let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nCompute\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) => layer 1\n2. (1+3(...)) => layer 2\n3. (1+3(...)) => layer 3\n...\nUp to layer 9.\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is layer 1, and each time we go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3(, then each time there's a (1+3(, so let me count the number of (1+3(...)) inside:\n\nStarting after the first 3(1+3(...)), each time there's another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the initial 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on until the innermost (1+3). So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) = 4\n2. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. Then, 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. Then, 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Then, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Then, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so that would be 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, let's compute each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which would be layer 9 as above, giving 36084.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let's see: the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each time we wrap another 3*(1 + ...), so up to layer 9, which would be the outermost. So, 9 layers in total, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I have 9 layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1+3(...\n3. And so on until the innermost (1+3)).\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1+3 occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the initial 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1+3). So, each time we have a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) => layer 1\n2. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) => layer 2\n3. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) => layer 3\n4. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) => layer 4\n5. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) => layer 5\n6. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) => layer 6\n7. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) => layer 7\n8. Inside that, 3(1+3(...)) => layer 8\n9. Inside that, (1+3) => layer 9\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is layer 9, and each layer wraps around it. So, perhaps I should compute starting from layer 9 and moving outward. Wait, that might be a better approach. Let me try that.\n\nSo, layer 9 is (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 8 is 3*(1 + layer9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 7 is 3*(1 + layer8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 6 is 3*(1 + layer7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5 is 3*(1 + layer6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 4 is 3*(1 + layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 3 is 3*(1 + layer4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 2 is 3*(1 + layer3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 1 is 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a calculation error, let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct each time. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3, because 3*(1 + x) = 3x + 3. Wait, that's another way to look at it. So, each layer's result is 3x + 3, where x is the previous layer's result.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I have 3*(1 + x), that's 3*1 + 3*x = 3 + 3x, which is 3x + 3. So, yes, each layer is 3x + 3, where x is the previous result.\n\nSo, starting from x = 4:\n\nLayer 8: 3*4 + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*15 + 3 = 45 + 3 = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*48 + 3 = 144 + 3 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*147 + 3 = 441 + 3 = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*444 + 3 = 1332 + 3 = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*1335 + 3 = 4005 + 3 = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*4008 + 3 = 12024 + 3 = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*12027 + 3 = 36081 + 3 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the same result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, with L_9 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 3*(1 + L_{n+1})\n\nWait, no, actually, since we're working from the innermost outward, L_9 is the innermost, so L_8 = 3*(1 + L_9), L_7 = 3*(1 + L_8), and so on up to L_1.\n\nSo, in general, L_{k} = 3*(1 + L_{k+1}), where k goes from 1 to 8, with L_9 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nEach time, we have L_{k} = 3*(1 + L_{k+1})\n\nWhich can be rewritten as L_{k} = 3 + 3*L_{k+1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nL_{k} = 3 + 3*L_{k+1}\n\nWe can rearrange it as:\n\nL_{k} - 3*L_{k+1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_{k} - 3*L_{k+1} = 0, which can be rewritten as L_{k} = 3*L_{k+1}\n\nThe characteristic equation would be r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L^{(h)}_k = C*3^k\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L^{(p)}_k = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n\n-2A = 3 => A = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 3/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, we have L_9 = 4. So, let's set k = 9:\n\nL_9 = C*3^9 - 3/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC*3^9 = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nC = (11/2) / 3^9 = (11/2) / 19683 = 11 / (2*19683) = 11 / 39366\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = (11 / 39366)*3^k - 3/2\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach it as a recurrence relation where each term is built from the next. Since we're working from the innermost outward, perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step as I did before.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a pattern in the numbers I computed:\n\nLayer 9: 4\n\nLayer 8: 15\n\nLayer 7: 48\n\nLayer 6: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 4: 1335\n\nLayer 3: 4008\n\nLayer 2: 12027\n\nLayer 1: 36084\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3, as I noted before. So, 4, 15, 48, etc. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can express L_k in terms of k.\n\nWait, another approach: since each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from 4, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to express L_1 as 3*(1 + L_2)\n\nSimilarly, L_2 = 3*(1 + L_3)\n\nSubstituting, L_1 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + L_3)) = 3 + 9*(1 + L_3)\n\nContinuing this substitution, each time we substitute the innermost term, we'd get a series expansion. Let me see if this leads to a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to recognize that this is a finite geometric series.\n\nEach term L_k = 3 + 3*L_{k+1}\n\nSo, let me try to express L_1 in terms of L_9.\n\nStarting from L_1:\n\nL_1 = 3 + 3*L_2\n\nBut L_2 = 3 + 3*L_3\n\nSo, L_1 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L_3) = 3 + 9 + 9*L_3\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 3 + 3*L_4\n\nSo, L_1 = 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*L_4) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*L_4\n\nContinuing this way, each time we substitute the next layer, we add another power of 3.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, from L_1 to L_9, let's see:\n\nL_1 = 3 + 3*L_2\n\n= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L_3)\n\n= 3 + 9 + 9*L_3\n\n= 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*L_4)\n\n= 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*L_4\n\nContinuing this substitution 9 times, we'd end up with:\n\nL_1 = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + 3^9*L_9\n\nWait, let me check that. Each substitution adds a term of 3^k and multiplies the next layer by 3^k.\n\nSo, after substituting all the way to L_9, which is 4, we have:\n\nL_1 = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*4\n\nBecause there are 9 layers, so the exponents go up to 3^9, but the last term is 3^9 times L_9, which is 4.\n\nSo, the sum would be the sum of a geometric series from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k, plus 3^9*4.\n\nWait, but the sum from k=1 to n of 3^k is (3^(n+1) - 3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, sum = (3^10 - 3)/2\n\nThen, adding 3^9*4, which is 4*3^9.\n\nSo, L_1 = (3^10 - 3)/2 + 4*3^9\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523\n\nThen, 4*3^9 = 4*19683 = 78732\n\nSo, L_1 = 29523 + 78732 = 108255\n\nWait, but that contradicts our earlier step-by-step computation where L_1 was 36084. So, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution approach. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I express L_1 in terms of L_9, I think I might have miscalculated the number of terms.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from L_1:\n\nL_1 = 3 + 3*L_2\n\nL_2 = 3 + 3*L_3\n\nL_3 = 3 + 3*L_4\n\n...\n\nL_8 = 3 + 3*L_9\n\nL_9 = 4\n\nSo, substituting each L_k into the previous equation:\n\nL_1 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L_3) = 3 + 9 + 9*L_3\n\n= 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*L_4) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*L_4\n\nContinuing this substitution 8 times (since we have L_9 as the innermost), we'd end up with:\n\nL_1 = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^8*L_9\n\nWait, so it's up to 3^8, not 3^9, because each substitution adds one power of 3, and we have 8 substitutions to reach L_9.\n\nSo, the sum would be from k=1 to 8 of 3^k plus 3^8*L_9.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\nSum from k=1 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 - 3)/2 = (19683 - 3)/2 = 19680/2 = 9840\n\nThen, 3^8*L_9 = 6561*4 = 26244\n\nSo, L_1 = 9840 + 26244 = 36084\n\nAh, that matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by including 3^9 in the sum, but actually, it's up to 3^8, since there are 8 substitutions before reaching L_9.\n\nSo, the correct formula is L_1 = (3^9 - 3)/2 + 3^8*4\n\nWhich is (19683 - 3)/2 + 6561*4 = 19680/2 + 26244 = 9840 + 26244 = 36084\n\nYes, that's correct. So, that's another way to compute it using the sum of a geometric series.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each subsequent layer is computed as 3*(1 + previous result). By either computing each layer step by step or using the geometric series formula, we arrive at the final result of 36084.\n\nI think that makes sense. To be thorough, let me verify one more time with another approach.\n\nAnother approach: Let's define the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers.\n\nLet me denote E_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12, but wait, no, actually, E_1 would be the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Wait, perhaps my notation is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E_n is the value after n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but that doesn't match our earlier numbers. Hmm, perhaps this approach is different.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me clarify.\n\nIf E_n is the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, then E_1 = 4\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nE_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nE_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nE_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nE_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nE_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nE_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nE_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier computation. So, E_9 = 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried using the geometric series, I had to adjust for the number of layers correctly, which led me to the same result. So, that seems solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're effectively adding another term in the expansion. So, with nine layers, we can model it as a sum of powers of 3 plus some multiple of the innermost value.\n\nBut I think the step-by-step computation is the most straightforward and least error-prone method here, especially since it's only nine layers. So, I can confidently say that the final result is 36084.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer once more:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent every time. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36084.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the result of the inner layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4) = 15\n3. Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 15) = 48\n4. Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 48) = 147\n5. Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 147) = 444\n6. Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Next layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Outermost layer: 3 \u00d7 (1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Maybe if I number the innermost expression as Layer 1, then the next one out as Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 would be the innermost 1 + 3, right? Let me write that down. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900+180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct.

Then 3*29524=88572, correct. So, I think that's the right answer. I didn't skip any steps, and each layer built upon the previous one correctly. I also checked each multiplication and addition step, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can define each level as a variable. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define the innermost expression first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Let me note that down as the next layer: Layer 2: 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Continuing this way: Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an error with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which would be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_2, but wait, actually, starting from the innermost, a_1 is (1+3), then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, perhaps it's better to index from the innermost as a_1, then a_2, etc., up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9. Let me try to see if I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see the values I computed: a_1 = 4, a_2 =13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Now, looking at these numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Let me see if there's a pattern or a recurrence relation. Each term seems to be following a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me check: a_2=1+3*4=13, correct. a_3=1+3*13=40, correct. a_4=1+3*40=121, correct. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048 divided by 2 is 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression, repeated nine times. By solving each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I compute Level 1 through Level 9, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting with Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Level 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Level 2 is 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Level 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Therefore, Level 3 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3(Level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, Level 4 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3(Level 4). Level 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Level 5 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3(Level 5). Level 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Breaking it down: 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Level 6 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3(Level 6). Level 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Level 7 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3(Level 7). Level 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Level 8 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8). Level 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Level 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3(Level 9). So, we take Level 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems a bit large. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Maybe I made an error in one of the levels. Let me go through each level again quickly.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number, and I was expecting maybe something smaller. Let me think again. Maybe I miscounted the number of levels. Let me check how many levels there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Level 1. Then each subsequent level adds another layer. Let's count the number of 3s inside.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Then inside, each time, another 3 is multiplied by another (1 + ...). So, how many 3s are there? Let's see: The first term is 3(...). Then, inside that, another 3(...), and so on, until the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, how many times does 3 appear as a multiplier? Let's count the number of 3s in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 introduces another 3. Let's count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost.\n2. Then inside, another 3.\n3. Then another 3.\n4. Then another 3.\n5. Then another 3.\n6. Then another 3.\n7. Then another 3.\n8. Then another 3.\n9. Then another 3.\n10. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the 10th term.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of 3s as multipliers is one less than the number of nested expressions. Since the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have a multiplier beyond that, but each layer adds a multiplier. So, if I have nine layers inside the first 3, then maybe there are nine 3s as multipliers. Let me check the count again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is the first level. Then inside that, another 3(...), which is the second level, and so on until the innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many levels are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach time, we have a new opening parenthesis, so:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, so that's nine times where a 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Then, each of those has a corresponding closing parenthesis. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is at level 9. So, I think my initial counting was correct: nine levels, from 1 to 9. So, the final result after computing Level 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, that seems really big. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each level manually. Maybe recognizing that each level is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each Level n is defined as 1 + 3*(Level n-1). So, it's a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Level n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is Level n = a + b*(Level n-1), where a=1 and b=3 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is Level n = a*(b^n - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, let me think about that.\n\nActually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence like Level n = a + b*Level n-1, with Level 1 = a + b*Level 0, where Level 0 would be 1, since Level 1 is 1 + 3*1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, Level 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, so Level 0 would be 1, as the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is Level 1.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence is Level n = (b^n - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is Level n = 1 + 3*Level n-1, with Level 1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, Level 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then Level 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Level 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nThe standard approach for such a recurrence is to solve it as follows:\n\nLevel n = 1 + 3*Level n-1\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: Level n - 3*Level n-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Level_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Level_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Level(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say n=1, Level(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is Level(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Level(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: Level(1) should be 4.\n\nLevel(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLevel(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLevel(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLevel(5)=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLevel(6)=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel(7)=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel(8)=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel(9)=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Level(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Level 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Level(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, Level(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each level is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we find that each level follows the formula Level(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to Level 9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is nested with each term being of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This forms a recursive sequence.\n\n2. **Define Levels:**\n   - Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Continue this up to Level 9.\n\n3. **Use Recurrence Relation:**\n   The recurrence is Level(n) = 1 + 3*Level(n-1). Solving this gives Level(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Level 9:**\n   Level(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3*Level(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can assign variables to each level. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as A1, then the next one as A2, and so on, up to A9, which would be the outermost expression. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to start from the inside and work our way out, computing each step as we go. So, let's consider the innermost part first: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(innermost expression). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times this entire expression. So after computing the innermost layers up to the outermost parentheses, we have the value inside the outermost parentheses as 29524, and then we multiply that by 3. Let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each additional (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each step adds one more layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each layer out adds another. Let me count the number of times I have \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3. Let me parse the expression:\n\n- The outermost is 3*(...)\n- Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...)\n- Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...)\n- And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear? Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nSo that's 9 layers in total, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), etc., up to layer9. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to 9 layers, but let me make sure I didn't skip any. Let me list each layer:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572. But wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say D. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, total expression = 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then total expression = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, total expression = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, which confirms our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and using a recurrence relation, we determine that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n3. **Work Outward**: For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer:\n   - Total = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as A\u2081, then moving outward as A\u2082, A\u2083, and so on, up to A\u2089, since there are nine layers. So:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3(A\u2081)\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3(A\u2082)\n\n...\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3(A\u2088)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3(A\u2089). Hmm, that seems manageable. So, if I compute each A from A\u2081 to A\u2089, then multiply the final one by 3, I should get the result. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with A\u2081:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple. Now, A\u2082 is 1 + 3 times A\u2081. So:\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to A\u2083:\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep going.\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so A\u2089 is 29524. But the entire expression is 3 times A\u2089, right? So:\n\nTotal = 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3 * 29524 = 3 * (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = (3*20000) + (3*9000) + (3*500) + (3*24)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from A\u2081:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and I didn't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute A\u2089 again step by step:\n\nStarting from A\u2081:\n\nA\u2081 = 4\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. Then 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but since each term is defined in terms of the previous one, it's probably easier to compute each step as I did.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from A\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine terms, computing each one step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081 can be expressed as A\u2099 = 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is A\u2099 - 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the solution A\u2099 = C*3\u207f, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say A\u2099 = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3*K = 1 \u21d2 -2*K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition A\u2081 = 4, we can solve for C:\n\n4 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u21d2 9/2 = 3C \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, A\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so A\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nA\u2081 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nA\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nA\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nA\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nA\u2085 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nA\u2086 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nA\u2087 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nA\u2088 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nA\u2089 = (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds for all the computed terms. Therefore, A\u2089 = (3^10 -1)/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*A\u2089 =3*(29524)=88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a deeply nested expression where each layer was 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the solution. It's interesting how both methods converge to the same result, which reinforces the correctness of the answer.\n\nI think I'm done here. The final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by defining each inner expression as \\( A_n \\) where \\( A_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent \\( A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1} \\). We compute each \\( A_n \\) step by step:\n\n1. \\( A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( A_2 = 1 + 3A_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( A_3 = 1 + 3A_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( A_4 = 1 + 3A_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( A_5 = 1 + 3A_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( A_6 = 1 + 3A_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( A_7 = 1 + 3A_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( A_8 = 1 + 3A_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( A_9 = 1 + 3A_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3A_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3A_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3 times the first Layer 1, but maybe I should think of each Layer as starting from the innermost. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 is 4. Let me write that down.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121. Let me compute that: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me calculate that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo writing that out: 88572.\n\nWait, but when I do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. So Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 is 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies down to 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, L(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The solution to this is L_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWhich can be written as L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So that's another way to see it.\n\nBut since we computed each layer manually and got the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, just in case I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is 3 times the previous, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3, starting from 4.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Since we've already broken it down and verified each step, I think it's solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using this method, each layer is calculated step by step until the outermost layer is reached. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can assign each innermost expression a variable or a number. Let's see, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me call that part A. So, A = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*A. Let's call that B. So, B = 1 + 3*A. Since A is 4, then B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so B is 13. Now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*B. Let's call that C. So, C = 1 + 3*B = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so C is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*C. Let's call that D. So, D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. D is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*D = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Let's call that E. E is 364. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*E = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Let's call that F. F is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Let's call that G. G is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*G = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Let's call that H. H is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*H = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Let's call that I. I is 29524. Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*I = 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Let's call that J. J is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(J). So, the entire expression is 3*J = 3*88573. Let's compute that. 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265719. Let me just go through that again quickly to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573, and finally 3*88573=265719. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me verify one or two of the multiplication steps to be sure. For example, when I calculated 3*9841: 9841*3. Let's do it step by step: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Similarly, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Then 1 + 88572=88573. Correct. Finally, 3*88573: 88573*3. Let's compute that: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding: 240000+24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that might help. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3 * Layer 1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3 * Layer 2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3 * Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3 * Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as 30000*3=90000, subtract 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428=88572. Either way, it's 88572. So, I think I did that correctly.

    "text": " The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the next layer. Let me try to formalize this. If I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, then each layer depends on the previous one. Starting from L1 = 4, then L2 = 13, L3 = 40, and so on. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step until I get to L9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me try that. Let's list them out:\n\n- L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n- L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n- L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n- L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n- L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n- L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n- L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n- L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n- L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so L9 is 29524? Let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, okay. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, yes. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, that's right. L6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L9 is indeed 29524. Now, the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify once more to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere. It's easy to slip up with so many calculations. Starting from the innermost:\n\n- L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- L2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- L3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- L4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- L5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply L9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it another way: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...))), it's similar to a continued fraction or a geometric progression. In fact, if we consider each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, verifying each layer, and also deriving a closed-form formula which gave the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, in the given expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay, let's continue.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that seems too large. Let me check my steps again because that might not be correct. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, perhaps there are 9 layers to compute. But when I started computing, I only got up to Layer 9, but maybe I misapplied the layers. Alternatively, perhaps the initial 3 is multiplied by the entire expression, which has 9 layers. So, perhaps the structure is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*L8, and so on down to L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then the entire expression would be 3*29524, which is 88572. But that seems quite large. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try again, more carefully. Let's write down each layer step by step, making sure I don't skip any steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if my approach is correct. For example, if there was only one layer inside, say 3*(1 + 3), that would be 3*(4) = 12, which is correct.\n\nIf there are two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nIf there are three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculation, with three layers, Layer 3 would be 40, and then 3*40 = 120, which seems correct.\n\nSo, perhaps my approach is correct, and the result is indeed 88572. But let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recursive pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nThus, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as I got earlier when I computed each layer step by step. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is indeed a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. We found C=-1/2, so the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible here.\n\nEach term a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n =1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) )=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, a_n =1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +... +3^{n-1} +3^n*a_0.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1=4=1+3, so perhaps a_0 would be 1. Let me check.\n\nIf n=1, a_1=1+3*a_0, but a_1=4, so 4=1+3*a_0 => 3*a_0=3 => a_0=1.\n\nThen, using the formula for a geometric series, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k -1. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, from the recurrence, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=1.\n\nSo, a_1=1+3*1=4\n\na_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but that's not exactly correct because each term is built upon the previous.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each a_n is built as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, from the general solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the same as (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then plus 1. So, the formula seems consistent.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few more layers using the formula and see if they match the step-by-step computation.\n\nFor example, a_4 should be 121.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, the formula holds, so the final answer is indeed 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me define each part as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is A = 1 + 3. Then the next layer out is B = 1 + 3A. The next one would be C = 1 + 3B, and so on, up to the ninth layer. So, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with A: A = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to the next layer, which is B: B = 1 + 3A = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so B = 1 + 12 = 13. So far, so good. Next layer, C: C = 1 + 3B = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so C = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. The numbers are growing quickly. Let me keep going. Next, D: D = 1 + 3C = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so D = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a big jump. Next layer, E: E = 1 + 3D = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so E = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, this is getting large. Let me proceed to the next one: F = 1 + 3E = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Thus, F = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's huge. Next, G: G = 1 + 3F = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Therefore, G = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Wow, that's massive. Continuing, H: H = 1 + 3G = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Thus, H = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next layer, I: I = 1 + 3H = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000+2523=29523. Therefore, I = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer, which is the entire expression, is 3 times I. So, the final result is 3*I = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572, so total is 87000+1572=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost: A=4, B=13, C=40, D=121, E=364, F=1093, G=3280, H=9841, I=29524, and then 3*I=88572. Each step seems to follow correctly. I multiplied each previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the last step where I just multiplied by 3. So, I think I did it right. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (A):**\n   \\[\n   A = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next layer (B):**\n   \\[\n   B = 1 + 3A = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next layer (C):**\n   \\[\n   C = 1 + 3B = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next layer (D):**\n   \\[\n   D = 1 + 3C = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next layer (E):**\n   \\[\n   E = 1 + 3D = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next layer (F):**\n   \\[\n   F = 1 + 3E = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next layer (G):**\n   \\[\n   G = 1 + 3F = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next layer (H):**\n   \\[\n   H = 1 + 3G = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next layer (I):**\n   \\[\n   I = 1 + 3H = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost layer:**\n    \\[\n    3I = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me define each part as follows: Let\u2019s denote each innermost expression as a variable to make it easier. Let me define: Let\u2019s say the innermost expression is A1 = 1 + 3 Then moving outward, A2 = 1 + 3*A1, A3 = 1 + 3*A2, and so on, up to A9, and then the entire expression would be 3*A9. Wait, actually, let me check the structure. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, perhaps starting from the innermost, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let me start with the innermost part: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: that's 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nContinuing: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: Let's compute that. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. So 300+60+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and each multiplication seems accurate. I don't see any errors in the computations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series of sorts, but with each term multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps allowing us to compute a_9 without computing each previous term. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of order 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1\n\nSolve for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, for the 9th term, which is a_9, we can compute:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the value we computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost multiplication:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, starting from E1: E1 = 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. So, E1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, E2 would be: E2 = 1 + 3(E1). Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me calculate that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, E2 = 13. Next layer out, E3 = 1 + 3(E2). Since E2 is 13, E3 = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. E3 = 40. Moving outward, E4 = 1 + 3(E3). E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40. That's 1 + 120 = 121. E4 = 121. Next, E5 = 1 + 3(E4). E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. E5 = 364.

E6 is 1093, so E7 = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 = 3280. Moving outward, E8 = 1 + 3(E7). E7 is 3280, so E8 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 = 9841. Finally, the outermost layer, E9 = 1 + 3(E8). E8 is 9841, so E9 = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 0*3=0, write down 0. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me write it properly. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Units digit: 2, carry over 1.\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit: 7, carry over 0.\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit: 5, carry over 1.\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit: 8, carry over 2.\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands digit: 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me confirm that:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that seems correct because 3*4=12, 3*2=6+1=7, 3*5=15, 3*9=27+1=28, and 3*2=6+2=8. So, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E9 was 29524, and the entire expression is 3*E9, so 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me retrace each step:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate any of the intermediate steps, because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nStarting again, E1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the right answer. It might seem tedious to compute each layer step by step, but breaking it down ensures that I don't make mistakes. Alternatively, I could look for a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation, especially since there are nine layers. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the expressions:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is of the form E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E(n).\n\nThe general form of such a linear recurrence is E(n) = a*E(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E(n) = (E(0) - b/(a-1)) * a^n + b/(a-1)\n\nWait, let me recall the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form E(n) = a*E(n-1) + b.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant E_p = b/(1 - a) when a \u2260 1.\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = E_h(n) + E_p = C*a^n + b/(1 - a).\n\nApplying the initial condition E(1) = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, E1 is the innermost term, which is E1 = 4. So, if we consider n=1, E(1)=4.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nE(n) = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying E(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have E9, which is when n=9. So, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*E9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the initial step-by-step computation.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, all these steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write a small program or use a calculator, I could verify each step, but since I'm doing this manually, I have to be extra careful.\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the entire expression can be seen as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nBut given the time I've spent, I think it's safe to conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as follows: Let\u2019s define E\u2081 = 1 + 3 Then, moving outward, E\u2082 = 1 + 3(E\u2081) Then E\u2083 = 1 + 3(E\u2082), and so on, up to E\u2089. Since the original expression is 3(E\u2088), right? Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). The innermost is E\u2081 = 1 + 3, then E\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081, E\u2083 = 1 + 3E\u2082, and so on until E\u2089. Then the original expression is 3E\u2088. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of E's. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's E\u2081. Then each subsequent layer adds another E. So, since there are nine sets of parentheses, perhaps I have E\u2081 to E\u2089, and the entire expression is 3E\u2088? Wait, no, let me see again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). The innermost part is (1 + 3), then the next one is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So perhaps each E is one level, and since there are nine sets of parentheses, I need to compute E\u2081 through E\u2089, where E\u2081 = 1 + 3, E\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081, E\u2083 = 1 + 3E\u2082, up to E\u2089. Then the original expression is 3E\u2088, because the outermost is 3*(E\u2088). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to count the number of times the pattern repeats. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = E\u2081\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(E\u2081) = E\u2082\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(E\u2082) = E\u2083\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(E\u2083) = E\u2084\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(E\u2084) = E\u2085\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(E\u2085) = E\u2086\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(E\u2086) = E\u2087\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(E\u2087) = E\u2088\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(E\u2088) = E\u2089\n\nSo, the innermost is E\u2081, and each subsequent E adds another layer. So, the entire expression is 3*(E\u2088). Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(E\u2088), since E\u2089 is 1 + 3*(E\u2088). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that. Alternatively, perhaps the original expression is 3*(E\u2089). Let me try to parse the original expression correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. Starting from the first 3, the expression inside is 1 + 3*(...), and each subsequent one adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps there are eight layers inside the first 3. Wait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 3s. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count how many times this occurs. Let me see: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the expression inside is 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer. Then, inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is the second layer, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 first layer\n2. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 second layer\n3. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 third layer\n4. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 fourth layer\n5. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 fifth layer\n6. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 sixth layer\n7. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 seventh layer\n8. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 eighth layer\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 ninth layer\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost part is (1 + 3), so that's the ninth layer. So, the entire expression is 3*(E\u2088), where E\u2088 is 1 + 3*(E\u2087), and so on. So, perhaps I should compute E\u2081 through E\u2089, starting from E\u2081 = 1 + 3, then E\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081, up to E\u2089, and then the entire expression is 3*(E\u2088). Alternatively, maybe it's 3*(E\u2089). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression first. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, that's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this E\u2081 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(E\u2081). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this E\u2082 = 13.\n\nNext layer out, we have 1 + 3*(E\u2082). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. E\u2083 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E\u2083) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. E\u2084 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E\u2084) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. E\u2085 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E\u2085) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total is 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. E\u2086 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E\u2086) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. E\u2087 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E\u2087) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. E\u2088 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E\u2088) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. E\u2089 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the expression before the innermost E\u2081. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, each E is defined as 1 + 3*(previous E). So, E\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. E\u2082 = 1 + 3*E\u2081 = 1 + 12 = 13. E\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to E\u2089 = 29524.\n\nBut the original expression is 3*(E\u2088), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(E\u2088). Wait, but according to the way I defined E's, E\u2089 is 1 + 3*E\u2088, so E\u2089 = 29524. Then, the original expression is 3*(E\u2088) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but that conflicts with my previous thought. Let me double-check. Let me parse the original expression again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is E\u2081. Then, each layer adds another 3*(previous E). So, E\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each E is one layer. So, the original expression is 3*(E\u2088). Because there are nine layers, but the first E is E\u2081, so E\u2088 would be the eighth layer, and then the original expression is 3*(E\u2088). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is E\u2081: (1 + 3) is the innermost. So, each subsequent E adds another layer. So, the original expression is 3*(E\u2088), since E\u2089 would be the next layer. Wait, no, let me think differently. Let me count the number of 3s in the original expression. Each time, it's 3*(...), so how many times does that happen?\n\nStarting from the first 3, each 3*(...) is a layer. So, the first 3 is the outermost, then inside it, another 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s. Let me count the number of 3s: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(...), so how many 3s are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 first 3\n2. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 second 3\n3. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 third 3\n4. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 fourth 3\n5. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 fifth 3\n6. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 sixth 3\n7. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 seventh 3\n8. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 eighth 3\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2192 ninth 3\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), so that's nine layers. So, each layer corresponds to E\u2081 through E\u2089, where E\u2081 is the innermost. So, E\u2081 = 4, E\u2082 = 13, E\u2083 = 40, up to E\u2089 = 29524. Then, the original expression is 3*(E\u2088), because the outermost is 3*(E\u2088). Wait, no, perhaps the original expression is 3*(E\u2089). Let me think about it again.\n\nWait, no, because E\u2089 is 1 + 3*E\u2088, so the original expression is 3*(E\u2088). Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). So, if there are nine layers, then the innermost is E\u2081 = 4, then E\u2082 = 13, up to E\u2089 = 29524, and the original expression is 3*(E\u2088). Because E\u2089 is 1 + 3*E\u2088, so E\u2088 is the value before the innermost E\u2089. Therefore, the original expression is 3*E\u2088, which is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E\u2089 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*E\u2088, so E\u2088 = 9841, then 3*E\u2088 = 3*9841 = 29523. So, the original expression is 29523. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3*E\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3*E\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3*E\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE\u2085 = 1 + 3*E\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE\u2086 = 1 + 3*E\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE\u2087 = 1 + 3*E\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3*E\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE\u2089 = 1 + 3*E\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, the original expression is 3*E\u2088, which is 3*9841. Let's compute that: 9841 * 3.\n\nCalculating 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought E\u2089 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*E\u2088 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the original expression is 3*E\u2088 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again. Let me write down each step:\n\nE\u2081 = 4\n\nE\u2082 = 13\n\nE\u2083 = 40\n\nE\u2084 = 121\n\nE\u2085 = 364\n\nE\u2086 = 1093\n\nE\u2087 = 3280\n\nE\u2088 = 9841\n\nE\u2089 = 29524\n\nOriginal expression: 3*E\u2088 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, the final result is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each time, there's a new opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 1\n2. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 2\n3. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 3\n4. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 4\n5. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 5\n6. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 6\n7. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 7\n8. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 8\n9. 3(1 + 3(...) \u2192 9\n\nSo, there are nine opening parentheses, which means nine layers. Therefore, E\u2081 to E\u2089, with E\u2089 being the innermost? Wait, no, because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, starting from the innermost. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is the last one, so the first opening parenthesis is the innermost. Let me think of it as a tree. Each time you have a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time you go deeper, you have another layer. So, the innermost is the last one, which is (1 + 3). So, that's E\u2081 = 4. Then, moving outward, E\u2082 = 1 + 3*E\u2081 = 13, and so on, up to E\u2089 being the outermost expression, which is 1 + 3*E\u2088. Therefore, the original expression is 3*E\u2088, which is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but if E\u2089 is 1 + 3*E\u2088, then the original expression is 3*E\u2088, which is correct because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the innermost is E\u2081 = 4, and each layer adds another 3*(...), so after nine layers, the outermost is 3*(E\u2088). So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after computing each E from E\u2081 to E\u2088, we find that E\u2088 = 9841, and then 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*9841 again:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400 \u2192 27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n40 * 3 = 120 \u2192 29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n1 * 3 = 3 \u2192 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is defined by E\u2099 = 1 + 3*E\u2099\u208b\u2081. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for E\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E\u2099 = 1 + 3*E\u2099\u208b\u2081, with E\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is E\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E\u2099^h = C*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E\u2099^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSubtract 3K from both sides:\n\n-2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E\u2081 = 4:\n\nE\u2081 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is E\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: E\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E\u2083 = (3\u2074 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E\u2084=(3\u2075-1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, E\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we need E\u2088, let's compute E\u2088:\n\nE\u2088 = (3\u2079 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u2079: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, E\u2088 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the original expression is 3*E\u2088 = 3*9841 =29523.\n\nSo, the final answer is 29523.\n\nI think that's consistent. I've checked each step, and the formula using the recurrence relation also gives the same result, so I'm confident that 29523 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, the general formula for each layer is derived, leading to the final computation of the outermost expression.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). \n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:** Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - \\(E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:** Each subsequent layer is calculated using the result from the previous layer:\n   - \\(E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - \\(E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n\n4. **Apply Recurrence Relation:** Recognize the recurrence relation \\(E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1}\\) and solve it to find a general formula:\n   - The general solution is \\(E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Compute the Final Expression:** The original expression is \\(3 \\times E_8\\):\n   - \\(E_8 = \\frac{3^9 - 1}{2} = \\frac{19683 - 1}{2} = 9841\\)\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 9841 = 29523\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{29523}"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let's denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost expression. Wait, actually, the innermost expression is the last one: (1 + 3). Then moving outwards, each next expression wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, E1 would be (1 + 3), then E2 would be 3*(E1 + 1), or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to write each step down. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, that's 4. Then, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). So, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that's the next layer. So, maybe each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can write this as a sequence. Let me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a1 is the innermost term: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first 3, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean that the outermost expression is 3*(a9). So, the total expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3 is 88572. So, the total expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each a1 to a9 again. a1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. a3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. a4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. a5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. a6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. a7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. a8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. a9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3*(29524). Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4. This is a recursive sequence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, a9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. That matches the a9 I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost term:\n- \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Each subsequent term is calculated as \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\).\n\nFollowing this pattern up to the ninth layer (\\(a_9\\)), we find:\n- \\(a_9 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying by the outermost 3:\n- \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*L_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*L_9=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the inside out. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). Starting with the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then next: 1 + 3(result from previous layer)\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. Let me write that down as Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result). That's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result). That's 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364. Continuing outward: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result). So, 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result). That is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280. Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result). So, 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this Layer 9 result. So, we have 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, because that's a lot of layers and it's easy to slip up. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe if I work from the inside out, I can keep track of each value as I compute it. Let's denote each inner expression as follows: Let me define E1 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, E2 would be 1 + 3*E1, E3 would be 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression. Then, the entire problem is 3*E9. So, perhaps I can compute E1 through E9 step by step. Let me try that. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving outward to E2: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so E2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's E2. Now, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, E3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, E4 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, E5 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from E1 to E9, each time I multiplied the previous E by 3 and added 1. Let me verify a few steps: E1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f E2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f E3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f E4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f E5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f E6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f E7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f E8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f E9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f It all seems to check out. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each step. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, nine times, starting from 1. So, maybe there's a formula for a geometric series or something similar here. Let's see: The expression can be represented as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4. Wait, actually, no: E1 is 1+3=4, but in my earlier breakdown, I started E1 as the innermost. So, maybe it's better to model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence: Let\u2019s define E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier steps, E1 was 4, E2 was 13, E3 was 40, etc. So, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4. So, for n=1: E1=4; n=2: E2=1 + 3*4=13; n=3: E3=1 + 3*13=40; and so on up to n=9: E9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*E9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express E_n in terms of a closed formula. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, E1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: E1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: E2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, E9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I still get the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same value: 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious computing each step manually, but breaking it down and then finding a formula helped confirm the result. I don't think I made any calculation errors because both methods gave the same answer, and I double-checked each step in the manual computation. So, yeah, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's see, 30,000 *3=90,000, but 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29,524 =30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 3*(30,000 -476)=90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yep, same result. So that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of pattern. Let me see. Each A(n) =1 +3*A(n-1). That's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is A(n) = (3^{n} -1)/2, but wait, let me verify that.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is A(n) =1 + 3*A(n-1), with A(1)=4. Let me see if that formula holds.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n=1, A(1)=4. The formula would be (3^1 -1)/2= (3 -1)/2=1, which is not 4. So maybe my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a different formula. Let's try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nWe have A(n) =1 +3*A(n-1), with A(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is A(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution, say A_p.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: A_p =1 +3*A_p.\n\nThen, A_p -3*A_p =1 => -2*A_p=1 => A_p= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is A(n) = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition A(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, A(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for A(n), the formula is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: A(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: A(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, A(9)=29524, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*A9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way without using the formula, just by expanding each step again.\n\nSo, let's start over and compute each A(n) step by step.\n\nA1=1+3=4\n\nA2=1+3*A1=1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nA3=1+3*A2=1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nA4=1+3*A3=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nA5=1+3*A4=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nA6=1+3*A5=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nA7=1+3*A6=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nA8=1+3*A7=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nA9=1+3*A8=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*A9=3*29524=88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the innermost term is 1+3=4=3+1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see: If I expand the expression, maybe it's a sum of 3^1 +3^2 +3^3 +... up to some term.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*(inner expression). So, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*13=40.\n\nWait, but 40 is 1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nWait, 40 is 3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1? Let's see: 27+9+3+1=40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 13 is 9+3+1=13.\n\n4 is 3+1=4.\n\nSo, each A(n) seems to be the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +...+3^{n}.\n\nWait, for A1=4=3^1 +3^0=3+1=4.\n\nA2=13=3^2 +3^1 +3^0=9+3+1=13.\n\nA3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=27+9+3+1=40.\n\nA4=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=81+27+9+3+1=121.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So, A(n) = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, A(n) is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n.\n\nSo, for A9, it's the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is exactly what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*A9=3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms it. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nWait, no. Wait, the innermost is 1 + 3, but that's actually just 4. Then the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, but this seems to be growing quickly. Let me check if I'm doing this right. Maybe I should write each step down methodically.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and working outward, each layer adds one more.

Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000. Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, actually, 29524 is 2*10,000 + 9*1,000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with the carryover.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as follows:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73.\n\n29000 \u00d7 3 = 87,000.\n\n524 \u00d7 3: 500\u00d73=1500, 24\u00d73=72, so 1500+72=1572.\n\nAdding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(\n2. Then another (1+3(\n3. Then another (1+3(\n4. Then another (1+3(\n5. Then another (1+3(\n6. Then another (1+3(\n7. Then another (1+3(\n8. Then another (1+3(\n9. Then another (1+3)\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is the ninth layer, which is (1+3). So, when I computed Layer 1 as (1+3)=4, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4=13, up to Layer 9 as 1 + 3*9841=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3)\n\nWait, that's nine opening parentheses, so nine layers. So, Layer 1 is (1+3)=4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3=1 + 3*13=40, Layer 4=1 + 3*40=121, Layer 5=1 + 3*121=364, Layer 6=1 + 3*364=1093, Layer 7=1 + 3*1093=3280, Layer 8=1 + 3*3280=9841, Layer 9=1 + 3*9841=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each step checks out. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for A and B.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSubstitute a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSo, a_n = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nBut we also have a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSo, equating the two expressions:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me try to compute each E from E9 to E1 step by step. Starting with E9: E9 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, E8 = 1 + 3(E9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, E8 = 13. Next, E7 = 1 + 3(E8) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Therefore, E7 = 40. Moving on to E6: E6 = 1 + 3(E7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Thus, E6 = 121. Now, E5 = 1 + 3(E6) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. So, E5 = 364. Next, E4 = 1 + 3(E5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: Let's break it down. 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, E4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, E4 = 1093. Moving out to E3: E3 = 1 + 3(E4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, E3 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Therefore, E3 = 3280. Now, E2 = 1 + 3(E3) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: Let's do 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, E2 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, E2 = 9841. Finally, E1 = 1 + 3(E2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, E1 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Therefore, E1 = 29524. Now, the entire problem is 3 times E1, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from E9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. E1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final result: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. Wait, let me verify the final multiplication again because that's a big number. 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is correct.

    "text": " Let me number them from the inside out. So, the innermost part is the ninth layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3 Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 9) Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 8) ... and so on, up to Layer 1: 1 + 3(Layer 2), and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 1. So, perhaps I can compute each layer starting from Layer 9 and moving outward. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, Layer 8 is 1 + 3 times Layer 9. So, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 7 is 40. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 6 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 4 is 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 3 is 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 2 is 9841. Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 1 is 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 1, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))), with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as a base case and work outwards. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had earlier. Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is correct. So, each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, if I compute f(9), that would give me Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*f(9). Wait, no, because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))), which is 3*f(9). Wait, actually, in my earlier approach, Layer 9 is f(1) = 4, Layer 8 is f(2) = 13, and so on up to Layer 1 being f(9). Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, let me compute f(n) up to n=9. Let's compute f(1) = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I had earlier. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each layer. Wait, but it's not a simple geometric series because each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). The recursive formula is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), whose solution is f(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say f_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, the entire expression is 3*f(n) = 3*(3^(n+1) -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, the expression becomes (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Continuing this way, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.

Wait, but the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me break that down. 29524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72.

Let me do it digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. Wait, I think I messed up the digit-by-digit computation because I was counting too many digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So, let's do it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. Let me just check each step one more time to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.

Correct. 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I just had to remember to compute each innermost part first and work my way outwards. Each step was pretty straightforward, just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, no complicated operations, just repetitive application of the same process. It's interesting how these nested expressions can get so large so quickly. Even though I only had nine layers, the number got into the tens of thousands. I can only imagine what it would look like with more layers.

Now, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*L9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 So, the result should be 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me think about expanding the expression. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, each multiplication by 3 adds another term. Let me try to write it out. Starting from the innermost: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 =12. Then, the next layer: 3*(1 + 12) =3*13=39. Next: 3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. Hmm, but wait, this seems similar to the layers I computed earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum. Let me think: Each time we have a term like 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which can be represented as 3 + 3^2*(...) So, expanding all the way, the expression would be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure if that's accurate because each term is multiplied by the previous one. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me try to see: Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me denote the inner part as F, so E = 3*(1 + 3*F). But F itself is similar to E but one layer less. Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me try to define E as the entire expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*E'), where E' is the expression one layer inside. But E' would be similar to E but with one fewer layer. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*E') E' = 3*(1 + 3*E'') And so on, until the innermost layer, which is just 1 + 3. Wait, but this might not be the easiest way. Alternatively, since I already have a formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and since the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches the previous result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can think of each nested part as a function or a step in a process. Let me denote each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost expression is E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving out one layer, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, that might not be exactly right because the outermost expression is 3*(something). Let me check. The entire expression is 3*(...), so if I compute the innermost part first, I can build up each layer step by step. So, let's start with the innermost part: E1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1093 is 3279, so E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9841 is 29523, so E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 times 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. So 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So the total expression is 88,572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with E1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. E2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. E3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. E4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. E6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me denote E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. Then, the general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution E_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. So the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct. Therefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied, but since I've already computed each step and verified with the formula, I think it's solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me define each inner expression as a separate term. Let me denote the innermost part as A, then the next one as B, and so on, until the outermost expression. So, starting from the innermost: A = 1 + 3 Then, moving one layer out: B = 1 + 3A Then, the next layer: C = 1 + 3B And so on, until the outermost expression, which would be 3 times the ninth layer. Wait, maybe that's too abstract. Let me try writing each step explicitly. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that's 40. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. The first innermost was 4, then 13, then 40. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula that can help me avoid computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me write down the computations step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8.

So, after computing the ninth layer, which is 29524, the outermost operation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let me compute that step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my computations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me confirm the multiplication for layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, 9841*3:\n\n- 1*3=3\n- 4*3=12, carry over 1\n- 8*3=24 +1=25, carry over 2\n- 9*3=27 +2=29\n\nSo, 9841*3=29,523. Then, 1 +29,523=29,524. So that's correct. Then, 29,524*3: Let me compute 29,524 *3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29,524*3=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n, which might save time if I have to compute many layers.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 C - 3C =1 \u21d2 -2C=1 \u21d2 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 A=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for the ninth layer, n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since I'm just starting out, maybe I should stick to the step-by-step approach until I'm comfortable with the formula.\n\nWait, but in the problem, how many layers are there? Let me count again. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I see a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, in the problem, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 layer 3\n4. And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, so maybe there are nine layers. So, n=9, which would mean a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of each layer as a step, starting from the innermost, then each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, the first step is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.

    "text": " Maybe I can assign each nested part to a variable. Let me define each level as follows: Let\u2019s say:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3  \nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)  \nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)  \n...  \nLevel 9: 1 + 3(Level 8)  \nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3(Level 9). Hmm, that might help. So, if I compute each level step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Level 1. Level 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Level 1 equals 4. Now, moving out to Level 2. Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Level 2 is 13. Next, Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Level 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3(Level 4). 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3(Level 5). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3(Level 6). 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, and 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3(Level 7). 3*3280. Let's compute that. 3000*3 is 9000, and 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Level 8 is 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3(Level 8). 3*9841. Let me calculate that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3(Level 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. The multiplication and addition all check out. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Maybe I can number them from the inside out, like Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. Let me try that. So, Layer 1 would be the innermost part: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let me check 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: each time I see (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set. So, starting from (1+3), that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, yes, Layer 9 would be the outermost one, which we computed as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the opening parentheses after the first 3: each time there's a \"(\", so let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9. Therefore, my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution. L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. If L_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor Layer 1 (n=1): L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2 (n=2): L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3 (n=3): L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4 (n=4): L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5 (n=5): L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6 (n=6): L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7 (n=7): L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8 (n=8): L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9 (n=9): L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting over:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check E9 again: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check E8 again: 3*3280. Let me compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nE7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nE6: 3*364. Let's compute 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nE5: 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nE4: 3*40=120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nE3: 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nE2: 3*4=12, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nE1: 1 + 3=4. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems accurate. Therefore, the final result should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers.

So, perhaps there are 8 layers? Wait, let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times we have 1+3(...) nested inside. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3(, then inside is 1 + 3(...), which is the first layer, then inside that is another 1 + 3(...), and so on until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.

Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3( is followed by 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 8 times? Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first layer is 3*(...), then inside that is 1+3*(...), and so on.

Let me count:\n\n- After the first 3(, we have 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the next part is 1+3(, which is the first layer.

Let's see:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds an opening parenthesis. So, from the first 3(, the next is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, etc., until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds an opening parenthesis. So, the first 3( is followed by 1+3(, which is the first layer. Then, inside that, another 1+3(, which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3.\n\nFrom the expression, after the first 3(, we have:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3\n\nWait, so after the first 3(, there are 8 \"1+3(\" sections, each adding a layer, and the innermost is 1+3 without a following parenthesis. So, that would make 8 layers, meaning E1 to E8, with E9 being the outermost expression.\n\nWait, no, that can't be, because when I computed earlier, I had E1 to E9, which gave me 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But if there are only 8 layers, then maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, the inside is 1+3(...), which is the first layer. Then, inside that, another 1+3(...), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections after the first 3.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside that, 1+3(...\n3. Continuing until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the first 3.\n\nLet me count:\n\n- After the first 3(, we have 1+3(, which is the first layer.\n- Inside that, another 1+3(, which is the second layer.\n- Continuing, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer.\n\nSo, let's count how many \"1+3(\" are there after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, the next is 1+3(, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(, which is layer 2.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(, layer 3.\n\nContinuing until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: 3(1+3(\nLayer 2: 1+3(\nLayer 3: 1+3(\nLayer 4: 1+3(\nLayer 5: 1+3(\nLayer 6: 1+3(\nLayer 7: 1+3(\nLayer 8: 1+3(\nLayer 9: 1+3\n\nWait, so actually, the expression has 9 layers, starting from the outermost 3*(...), then 8 more layers inside. So, that would make E1 to E9, as I initially thought.\n\nTherefore, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to E9=29524, and the final result being 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the outermost 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1+3*(...), which is the first layer.\n\nInside that, another 1+3*(...), which is the second layer.\n\nContinuing until the innermost, which is 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...\n2. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(...\n9. 1+3*(1+3\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers in total. So, E1 to E9, each being 1+3*E(n-1). So, E1=1+3=4, E2=1+3*4=13, and so on up to E9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute the number of layers another way. Each time we have a 1+3*(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1+3, which is layer 1: E1=4.\n\nThen, the layer outside that is 1+3*(E1)=1+3*4=13, which is E2.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1+3*(E2)=1+3*13=40=E3.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we're adding a new layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, if we have 9 layers, E9 would be the outermost expression inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, then 1+3(, then another 1+3(, etc., until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the first 3.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so that's 9 \"1+3(\" sections after the first 3, meaning 9 layers. Therefore, E1 to E9, as I calculated before.\n\nThus, my initial computation stands: E9=29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute E9 again step by step.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems to add up. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, E1 = 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) but wait, actually, since it's the innermost, E1 would just be 1 + 3* something, but in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3* nothing? Wait, no, actually, looking back, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3*(next layer). Let me check: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3). Then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So E2 = 13. Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. E3 = 40. Then E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. E4 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. E5 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. So E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's break it down. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240=9840. So E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times E9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(E9). So, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, the total is 88572.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So reading the digits from top: 7, 7, 8, 5, 2. So 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.

Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 4*3=12, carry 1; 6*3=18 +1=19, carry 1; 3*3=9 +1=10. So, 364*3=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 3*3=9; 9*3=27; 0*3=0; 1*3=3. So, 1093*3=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 0*3=0; 8*3=24, carry 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 3*3=9. So, 3280*3=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE1: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 1*3=3; 4*3=12, carry 1; 8*3=24 +1=25, carry 2; 9*3=27 +2=29. So, 9841*3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Wait, that's what I got before. Hmm, but let me verify again because sometimes when you carry over, you might make a mistake. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n---------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I feel like the number is getting really big, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each step manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLooking at the expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3* something. Wait, but in our case, the innermost term is 1 + 3, so maybe a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, perhaps my approach was correct, but let's see if there's a formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. Good.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nNow, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. That's the same result as before. So, my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and using the recurrence relation formula also gives the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. However, it's a bit more complicated because each term is not just multiplied by 3 but also has an added 1. So, perhaps the formula I used earlier is the right way to approach it.\n\nIn any case, both methods give me the same result, so I'm pretty sure that the answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I can confidently say that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each inner expression as \\( E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_9 \\), where \\( E_9 \\) is the innermost one.

    "text": " The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2. L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Continuing this way: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, but in the original problem, each term is multiplied by 3 after the addition. Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I misapplied the multiplication. Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the outermost term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps my layers are correct, but I might have miscounted how many layers there are. Let me recount the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let's count the number of 3s after the first one. There are nine 3s after the initial one, which means there are nine layers. So, each layer is one more than three times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe my earlier computation is correct. Let me try to compute each layer again step by step, carefully. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(L9). Wait, but in my layers, L9 is the innermost. Wait, perhaps I got the layers reversed. Let me think again. The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is L1. Then each layer is built by wrapping another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the innermost layer. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me clarify. Let's write the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, E = 3*(L1), where L1 = 1 + 3*(L2), L2 = 1 + 3*(L3), and so on until L9 = 1 + 3. So, starting from L9: L9 = 1 + 3 = 4. L8 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L7 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L6 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L4 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L3 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L2 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L1 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, E = 3*L1 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems like a big number, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nStarting from L9:\nL9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*L1 = 3*29524.

Now, add them up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...)\n\n2. 1+3(1+3(...))\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n\n... and so on until the ninth layer.\n\nSo, yes, nine layers, meaning nine steps as I did above. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the earlier steps to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, after nine layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the value after n layers is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Next layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Maybe if I work backwards, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outwards, I can compute each part step by step. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing all nine layers, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I should check each layer again to ensure accuracy. Let's go through each layer step by step again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set the left side equal to the right side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3 times the sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, the inner expression is similar to E/3, because E = 3*(something), so something = 1 + 3*(something else). Hmm, maybe I can express it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let's see, if I let the inner expression be S, then S = 1 + 3*(another inner expression), and so on. But perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation. Wait, but I already did that with the layers. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have 9 layers, maybe the total expression can be expressed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which is exactly what I did before, so 3*(29524) =88572. So, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding the expression step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression. Wait, each time we have a term that's 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote the innermost term as t, then the next term is 1 + 3t, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3t) =1 +3 +9t=4 +9t, and so on. But that seems more complicated than using the recurrence relation approach. I think the way I did it initially, computing each layer step by step, is the most straightforward, especially since there are only nine layers to compute. It might be tedious, but it's reliable. Let me just recheck the multiplication at the end: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as:\n\n29524 *3 = (30000 - 476) *3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 =90000 -1428=88572. That's another way to compute it, and it also gives 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times 29524\\). Calculating this gives:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Then the next one is 1 + 3*(that innermost). So, perhaps A1 is 1 + 3, then A2 is 1 + 3*A1, A3 is 1 + 3*A2, and so on until A9, which would then be multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Wait, but the problem starts with 3*(A9). Let me confirm that. So, the structure is 3*(A9), where A9 is 1 + 3*(A8), and so on down to A1 = 1 + 3. That seems right. So, let's compute each A from A1 to A9 step by step. Starting with A1: A1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so A2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, A3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so A3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Moving on to A4: A4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so A4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Now, A5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Thus, A5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, A6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364.

Computing 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840. Thus, A8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, A9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, A9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*A9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.

    "text": " The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see how many layers there are. Counting the opening parentheses, I think there are nine layers. Wait, no, actually, each time the expression repeats, so maybe it's better to consider each layer as a step. Let me try to compute each step starting from the innermost parentheses. Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Step 2: Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer is 13. Step 3: Next layer out is again 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40. Step 4: Continuing outward, 1 + 3*(result from Step 3).

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, now we have 3280. Step 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, this layer is 9841. Step 9: Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that: 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, this layer is 29524. Now, finally, the outermost layer is 3 times the result from Step 9. So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 29,524. Let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3. Let's compute each digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 is the same as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the steps were: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the outermost 3 times that is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me double-check one of the steps where I might have made an error. For example, when I computed 3*1093: 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. That seems correct. Similarly, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then, 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems right. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, E9 = 1 + 3. Then E8 = 1 + 3*E9, E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, until E1 = 1 + 3*E2, and the entire expression is 3*E1. Hmm, that might help. Let me write this down step by step. First, compute E9: E9 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, moving one layer out, E8 = 1 + 3*E9. Since E9 is 4, E8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E8 is 13. Next, E7 = 1 + 3*E8. Plugging in E8's value: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E7 is 40. Moving on to E6: E6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E6 is 121. Now, E5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Next, E4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, E4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E4 is 1093. Moving outward, E3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Thus, E3 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E3 is 3280. Next, E2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Therefore, E2 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E2 is 9841. Now, the outermost expression is E1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, E1 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*E1, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from E9: 1+3=4, correct. E8: 1+3*4=13, correct. E7: 1+3*13=40, correct. E6: 1+3*40=121, correct. E5: 1+3*121=364, correct. E4: 1+3*364=1093, correct. E3: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. E2: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. E1: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524: let's compute 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524*3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6+1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27+1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6+2=8. So, writing it down: 29524*3=88572. Yep, same result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way, perhaps using a different approach. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). So, each time, you're adding 1 and then tripling the result, except for the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3. Wait a second, so each step is like a geometric series? Let me see: If I have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, until E_9 = 1 + 3. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see: Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_9=4. So, E_8 = 1 + 3*E_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which we already have. E_7 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n. Let me recall that for such a recurrence, E_n = a*r^n + b, where r is the common ratio, which in this case is 3. Let me try to model it. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like E_n = c*E_{n-1} + d is E_n = A*r^n + B, where r is the root of the characteristic equation, which in this case is 3, and B is a constant to be determined. Let me set up the equation: E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1. The characteristic equation is r = 3. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n + B. Now, let's plug this into the recurrence relation: E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) = A*3^n, and 3*B = 3B, so we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we need to find A using the initial condition. Let's see, when n=9, E_9 = 4. So, plug n=9 into the general solution: E_9 = A*3^9 - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, A*3^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2) / 3^9. Let's compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, A = (9/2) / 19683 = (9)/(2*19683) = 9/39366 = 1/4374. So, A = 1/4374. Therefore, the general formula for E_n is E_n = (1/4374)*3^n - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=9: E_9 = (1/4374)*19683 - 1/2. Compute (1/4374)*19683: 19683 / 4374. Let's compute that: 4374*4 = 17496, 4374*4.5 = 17496 + 2187 = 19683. So, 19683 / 4374 = 4.5. Therefore, E_9 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4, which is correct. Good, so the formula works for n=9. Now, let's compute E_1 using this formula. E_1 corresponds to n=1, but wait, in our earlier setup, n=9 was the innermost, so actually, when n=1, it's the outermost expression. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me think again. In our problem, E9 is the innermost, so n=9 corresponds to the innermost expression, and E1 is the outermost. So, if we have E_n = (1/4374)*3^n - 1/2, then E9 = 4, as we saw. But we need E1, which would be n=1? Wait, no, because the expressions are nested, so each E_n is built upon the previous one. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since the closed-form might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can compute E_n for n=1 to 9 using the formula. Let me try that. E_n = (1/4374)*3^n - 1/2. Let's compute E9: n=9: (1/4374)*19683 - 1/2 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4, correct. E8: n=8: (1/4374)*6561 - 1/2. 6561 / 4374 = 1.5. So, 1.5 - 0.5 = 1, but wait, earlier we had E8=13. That doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe my indexing is off. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Maybe n=9 corresponds to E1, and n=1 corresponds to E9? Let me check. If I set n=1 for E9, then E9 = (1/4374)*3^1 - 1/2 = 3/4374 - 1/2 \u2248 0.000685 - 0.5 \u2248 -0.499315, which is not 4. So that can't be right. Maybe the formula is E_n = A*3^{9 - n} - 1/2. Let me try that. So, E9 would be A*3^{0} - 1/2 = A - 1/2 = 4 => A = 4.5. So, E_n = 4.5*3^{9 - n} - 1/2. Let's test this for n=9: E9 = 4.5*1 - 0.5 = 4, correct. For n=8: E8 = 4.5*3^{1} - 0.5 = 4.5*3 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13, correct. For n=7: E7 = 4.5*3^2 - 0.5 = 4.5*9 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40, correct. For n=6: E6 = 4.5*3^3 - 0.5 = 4.5*27 - 0.5 = 121.5 - 0.5 = 121, correct. For n=5: E5 = 4.5*3^4 - 0.5 = 4.5*81 - 0.5 = 364.5 - 0.5 = 364, correct. For n=4: E4 = 4.5*3^5 - 0.5 = 4.5*243 - 0.5 = 1093.5 - 0.5 = 1093, correct. For n=3: E3 = 4.5*3^6 - 0.5 = 4.5*729 - 0.5 = 3280.5 - 0.5 = 3280, correct. For n=2: E2 = 4.5*3^7 - 0.5 = 4.5*2187 - 0.5 = 9841.5 - 0.5 = 9841, correct. For n=1: E1 = 4.5*3^8 - 0.5 = 4.5*6561 - 0.5 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524, correct. So, the formula works if we define E_n = 4.5*3^{9 - n} - 0.5, where n ranges from 1 to 9. Therefore, the outermost expression, which is 3*E1, would be 3*(29524) = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have used this formula to compute E1 directly without computing each E step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large (nine layers), the step-by-step approach was manageable. However, if there were more layers, the formula would be more efficient. But in this case, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the result to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is built upon the previous one.\n\nSo, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I ended up with 88573, but that was after 9 layers, and then I thought I had to multiply by 3, but maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me list each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the result after Layer 9 was 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572, which is the final result.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought I had 88573, but that was a mistake because I had included an extra layer perhaps. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, in my initial calculation, I went through 10 layers, which might have been incorrect. So, perhaps the correct number of layers is 9, leading to 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that again.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in each layer.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. 27000 + 2523 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute this again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24*3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial thought process, I thought I had 88573, but that was a mistake because I had miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. So, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and multiplying by 3 at the end, I arrive at the result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outward, we compute each step and finally multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1 (Innermost):**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Outermost Multiplication:**\n    - Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define each part step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me call the innermost expression as A1, then moving outward as A2, A3, up to A9. So, A1 would be the innermost 1 + 3(...), but since it's the innermost, it's just 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each next layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, maybe I should work from the inside out, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that innermost expression. So, that would be 1 + 3*(innermost). Since the innermost is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). The previous layer was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. Wait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So, it's like a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nLet me list each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me verify 29524 * 3 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them again: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the outermost: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n2. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n3. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n4. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n5. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n6. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n7. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n8. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n9. ...*(1 + 3*(...)\n10. ...*(1 + 3))))) So, actually, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", and then the outermost is multiplied by 3. Wait, so maybe my earlier count was wrong. Let me recount.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost:\n\n- The first \"1 + 3(...)\" is the first layer.\n- Then inside that, another \"1 + 3(...)\", which is the second layer.\n- Repeating this, each time I see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nSo, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences. Let's write the expression out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3*, that's 1. Then each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. ...*(1 + 3*(...))\n10. ...*(1 + 3))\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is \"1 + 3)\", so that's the end of the innermost layer. So, starting from the outermost, each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer, and there are 9 such layers before the innermost \"1 + 3\". So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, my initial count was correct: 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), Layer 2 is next, up to Layer 9, which is the one just inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again. When I computed Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, that gives 88572. But let me verify that each step is correct because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with so many layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be solved using a formula, especially if it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, in this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C * r^n + D, where r is the common ratio (in this case, 3) and D is a constant to be determined.\n\nSo, let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check my initial step-by-step computation again, because sometimes I might have miscounted the layers or miscalculated a step.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the closed-form formula supports the step-by-step result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.
