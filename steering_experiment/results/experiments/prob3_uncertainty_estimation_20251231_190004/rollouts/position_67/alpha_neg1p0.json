    "text": " So putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. But earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit, I got 87572. Hmm, that's inconsistent. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me try that again. 29524: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So multiplying each digit by 3: 4 * 3 = 12; write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7; write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15; write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28; write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8; write 8. So the result is 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So 87572. Wait, but when I added 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have messed up either the digit-by-digit or the place-by-place addition. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So 2*10,000 = 20,000; 9*1,000 = 9,000; 5*100 = 500; 2*10 = 20; 4*1 = 4. So adding all these: 20,000 + 9,000 = 29,000; 29,000 + 500 = 29,500; 29,500 + 20 = 29,520; 29,520 + 4 = 29,524. So that's correct.\n\nNow, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it as 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524.\n\n29,524 + 29,524: Let's add 20,000 + 20,000 = 40,000; 9,000 + 9,000 = 18,000; 500 + 500 = 1,000; 20 + 20 = 40; 4 + 4 = 8. So 40,000 + 18,000 = 58,000; 58,000 + 1,000 = 59,000; 59,000 + 40 = 59,040; 59,040 + 8 = 59,048.\n\nNow, add 59,048 + 29,524: 50,000 + 20,000 = 70,000; 9,000 + 9,000 = 18,000; 500 + 500 = 1,000; 40 + 20 = 60; 8 + 4 = 12.\n\nWait, that's not the right way. Let me add properly:\n\n59,048\n+29,524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the sum is 88,572. So 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I must have miscounted the places. So the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit earlier, I got 87,572, which is different. So I must have made a mistake in that method. Let me try digit-by-digit again, carefully.\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 (from 2*3 + 2), 8 (from 9*3 +1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3 +1), 2 (from 4*3). So the number is 88,572. Okay, that's correct now. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Because if any of the layers were computed incorrectly, the final answer would be off.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo all layers are correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the innermost one, right? Wait, no. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n- Then the next is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is Layer 2.\n- Then 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = Layer 3.\n- And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the total layers are 9, each time adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So my computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the total is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this recurrence can be expressed in a closed-form formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution is a_n = C*3^n + D.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, LHS: C*3^n + D = RHS: C*3^n + 3D + 1\n\nComparing both sides:\n\nC*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 3D + 1\n\nSo, -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for a problem with only nine layers, both methods work.\n\nSo, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I arrived at the result of 88,572. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each step checks out, and the closed-form solution aligns with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\((3^{n+1} - 1)/2\\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4. Each subsequent layer builds on the previous one until the outermost layer (n=9) is calculated as 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 yields the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 as 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 1500 + 72 = 1572. Then 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did it right.

However, in our case, the expression is finite, with nine layers. So, maybe it's a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous one. Let's model this.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4, and the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the formula. If we have 9 layers, then the outermost multiplication by 3 would be 3*(Layer9). So, using the formula, Layer9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the formula. Let me see.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(Layer9). Since Layer9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*(Layer9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula, and it gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n\n3. Realize that the layers follow a linear recurrence relation.\n\n4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a general formula for each layer.\n\n5. Use the formula to compute the outermost layer directly.\n\n6. Multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\n7. Verify the result using two different methods (direct computation and the formula) to ensure accuracy.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then subtract (30,000 - 29,524) * 3. 30,000 - 29,524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if there's a formula for such a series. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles the expansion of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. In general, a nested expression like this can be represented as a sum: Let me denote S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. So, in our case, n = 9. Then, S can be written recursively as S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next layer. But since each layer is similar, after n layers, we can find a formula for S_n. However, since n is 9, which is not too large, computing each layer step by step is manageable. Alternatively, we can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, as I computed earlier, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in such a recurrence. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Now, let's assume that as n approaches infinity, a_n approaches infinity as well, but for finite n, we can still use the general solution. Alternatively, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition at n=1: a_1=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it properly:\n\nWait, 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry over 0.\n\n0 + 5 = 5. Write 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18. Write 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. That matches the previous calculation. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because I don't want to make a mistake here. Alternatively, I can compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, and since 29524 is 30000 - 476, then 3*(29524) = 3*30000 - 3*476 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a step to ensure that I correctly computed Layer 9 as 29524. Let me retrace my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. Each layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check the computation of Layer 9 again. Let's compute Layer 8 first: Layer 8 is 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As we computed earlier, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, with the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Oh, so I made a mistake earlier in the digit-by-digit calculation. The correct total is 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I could have used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can express it without computing each term step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few terms: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, matches a_3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct, matches a_4. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's exactly what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute the result without having to calculate each layer, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors. But since I was able to compute it step by step correctly, and both methods gave me the same result, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, looking at the values: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result: 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times I computed layers:\n\nLayer 1: innermost 1+3\nLayer 2: next one\n...\nUp to Layer 9: the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer is properly computed, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me try computing it step by step again, maybe using a different approach or looking for a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation.\n\nWait, this expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recursive formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, that's nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, matches Layer 1.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches Layer 2.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches Layer 3.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, matches Layer 4.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, matches Layer 5.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, matches Layer 6.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, matches Layer 7.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, matches Layer 8.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, matches Layer 9.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I want to compute the entire expression, which is 3*a_9, it would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nThis method is much faster because it uses the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, if there were, say, 20 layers, using the formula would save a lot of time.\n\nBut in any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents, let me verify 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Perfect. So, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used two different methods to arrive at the same answer, and verified the calculations. So, I don't see any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer (Layer 9), we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Hmm, the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). It looks similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's reassuring. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) directly using the formula. Since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to think about it. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer again with the formula to see if I can spot any errors. Using a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = 40. Correct. a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = 121. Correct. a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = 364. Correct. a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = 1093. Correct. a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = 3280. Correct. a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Correct. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Correct. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524: 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me go back a bit. When I was computing Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think my calculations are correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in each step. Another way to check is to see if the pattern follows a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It seems like each layer is following the pattern L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see: The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: L(1) = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9 layers, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step using the closed-form solution. Since each layer is L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*L(9) = 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

    "text": " So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing it from the top: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. Therefore, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication another way. Maybe using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can add 29,524 three times: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, 3 * 29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my earlier layers because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong. Let's go back step by step through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.

Wait, hold on. Earlier, I wrote 1 + 3*364 as 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. But in my initial calculation, I had 1093. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, all layers seem to compute correctly. Therefore, I think my final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing the expression step by step again, more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times this result: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my calculations now. So, I think the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or a formula that could simplify the computation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nWait, but let me check: in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, which corresponds to n=1, so the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier computation. Let me compute a_9 using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, I can compute the value without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nSo, in general, for an expression with k layers of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), the value would be 3*(3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn this case, k = 9, so the value is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can directly compute the value as (3^{11} - 3)/2, which equals 88,572.\n\nThis confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using the derived formula, we find the value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n7.

Next layer: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

It's easy to make mistakes with carries, so breaking it down into place values as I did above is more reliable.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a layer, leading to an incorrect final result.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3 * 9841: 9841 * 3.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\n8 * 3 = 24\n\n9 * 3 = 27\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n9841\nx   3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, which is 1 + 29523.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: As we saw, that's 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once more to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations now. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each step and find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

    "text": " So, putting it together: 87572. Wait, let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 87572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 2+2=4, 9+9=18, 5+5=10, 2+2=4, 4+4=8. So, 59048. Then, add 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524: 8+4=12, 4+2=6, 0+5=5, 9+9=18, 5+2=7. Wait, that seems off. Let me add properly:\n\n  59048\n+29524\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0.\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8.\nSo, the sum is 88572. Wait, but earlier I got 87572 when multiplying by 3. That doesn't match. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check 29524 * 3 again. Alternatively, maybe I should use a calculator approach, but since I don't have a calculator, I'll try to compute it accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 3 * 29524:\n\nBreakdown:\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n3 * 500 = 1500\n3 * 20 = 60\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nAh, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 87572. That was incorrect. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524, I got 88572, which matches this result. So, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I must have added incorrectly. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3 times that is 88572. But let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the earlier layers, which would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me start over and compute each layer step by step, making sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first computed 3*29524, I thought it was 87572, but upon breaking it down, it's 88572. So, that was my mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this problem differently, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nSo, each layer is defined recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L0, where L0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L1 = 4, which is when n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n...\n\nI can see that each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, the general formula for L_n is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier values to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each layer, used a recurrence relation approach, and confirmed that the formula gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives the value of the innermost layer, which is then used to compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I can check a couple of layers to ensure that my calculations were correct. Let's go back to Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. Wait, but L_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. Let's compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, 7; carryover 0. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8, 8. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when doing repetitive steps, it's easy to make an error. Let me recount the layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since this is a nonhomogeneous recurrence, we can solve it using iteration or finding a pattern. Let's try to find a pattern by computing the first few terms: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. Alternatively, it can be modeled as a geometric series. Let me try to express Ln in terms of L1. Let's write down the relation:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nWe can expand this recursively:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L1\nL4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2*L1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L1\n...\n\nSo, in general, Ln = (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}) + 3^{n} * L1\n\nWait, let's test this for n=2:\n\nL2 = (1) + 3^2 * L1 = 1 + 9*4 = 1 + 36 = 37, but L2 is actually 13. So that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is different. Let me try another approach.\n\nSince each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nLn = C*3^{n} + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nLn = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLn = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me verify the multiplication once more:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that also works.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.

So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000, 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. So 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, same result. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis is followed by 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Starting from the left, after the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)). Each time, it's 1 + 3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count: The first one after 3 is layer 1: (1 + 3(...). Then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3( [1] +3( [2] +3( [3] +3( [4] +3( [5] +3( [6] +3( [7] +3( [8] +3( [9] +3))))))))))))) So there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. So my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, each step up to layer 9 is accurate, and the final result is 88572. So I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: If we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), with n layers, it's similar to a geometric series. Let me try to find a general formula. Let's denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_k = A*3^k, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for k=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, 5; carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8; carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute too many. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3\" is one layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, then each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each next layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, it's (1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n3. Then (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n... and so on, until we have 9 layers? Wait, actually, the original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would mean 9 layers. So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if it matches. Let me think about the general form of such expressions. Suppose I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. In this case, a=1 and b=3, and n=9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, but in our problem, the outermost is 3*(...), so the inner expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and then we multiply by 3. Let me see if there's a formula for this. Let's denote S(n) as the value of the inner expression with n layers, so S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1). Let's compute S(n) for n=1 to 9:\n\nS(1) = 4\n\nS(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nS(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nS(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nS(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nS(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nS(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nS(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nS(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for S(n). Let's try to solve the recurrence relation S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S(n) = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nS(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1)\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + C)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + C = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3C\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: C = 1 + 3C\n\nThen, C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, S(n) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition S(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: S(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, S(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, S(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer step by step, then used a general formula for the recurrence relation to confirm that S(9)=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can check the total number of layers. Since the expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...), I think there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, each layer is computed correctly. Another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the innermost layer (n=1) to the outermost (n=9), we compute each layer and then multiply the outermost result by 3. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with n layers. In this case, n=9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15? Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 13. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, no, in my earlier calculation, Layer 2 was 1 + 3*Layer1, which was 1 + 3*4=13, but in this formula, a_2=3*(1 + a_1)=3*(1+4)=15, which is different. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Wait, maybe the way I defined a_n is incorrect. Let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, if I let a_n represent the innermost expression, then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...) around it. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to model it as a recurrence relation where each term is built from the previous one. Let me try again. Let me define a sequence where each term is the result after each layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric series or something. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be expressed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.

    "text": " Write down 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524: 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe I should check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280, which is correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840. 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a formula or a pattern that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming, and it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, all the layers seem correct, and the multiplication at the end is correct as well. Therefore, I think the answer is indeed 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute this expression another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from n1 = 1 + 3, n2 = 1 + 3n1, n3 = 1 + 3n2, and so on. This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, that's the same as before. So, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_{i} = 1 + 3a_{i-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_i - 3a_{i-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^i. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_i = C*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. So, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier values. For i=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For i=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For i=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for i=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3*a9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've thoroughly checked this, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula, confirming that each layer's value is \\(\\frac{3^{i+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for the outermost layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think I did that correctly. Just to make sure, maybe I can check with a different approach. Alternatively, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n. Wait, but that seems like a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3. So, if Layer k is the sum from i=0 to k of 3^i, which is (3^(k+1) - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps it's better to model it recursively. Let me try that. Let me define L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. And so on, as before. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each layer in terms of powers of 3. Let me see: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 + something? Wait, 3^2 = 9, (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Oh, that's exactly L1. Similarly, L2 = 13. Let's compute (3^3 - 1)/2: 27 - 1 = 26, 26/2 = 13. That's exactly L2. L3 = 40. (3^4 - 1)/2 = 81 - 1 = 80, 80/2 = 40. Correct. L4 = 121. (3^5 - 1)/2 = 243 - 1 = 242, 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, it seems that Layer k is equal to (3^(k+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer corresponds to a term in a geometric series.

    "text": " Write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But since it's 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476. So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then, 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let me compute 1,093 * 3: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,280 * 3: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 9,841 * 3: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check 29,524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Wait, but that's breaking it down into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Wait, but 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Correct. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, which can be expressed recursively. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent with what I did before. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: If I have a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are n layers, then the value can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).
