    "text": " So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check that multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is less than that. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, so 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + r^{n} * (a_0), but wait, actually, let me recall the formula properly. The solution for a linear recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c=1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds one more layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3( : There are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, from innermost to outermost, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, and its value is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, we get the same result as computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which is what I did initially. It's good that both methods led me to the same answer, so I can be confident that 88,572 is correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. After computing up to layer 9, which gives 29,524, multiply by 3 to get the final answer, 88,572. 4. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation, confirming that the 9th layer is 29,524, then multiply by 3. Both methods lead to the same result, so I feel confident that this is the correct answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, as each step was double-checked, and the formula approach corroborated the step-by-step computation. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1, 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, carry over 1, 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So, that's 59048. Now, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. So, 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a specific formula. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c = 1, r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c / (r - 1)) * (r^{n} - 1) + (a_0 - c / (r - 1)) * r^{n}. Wait, maybe I should derive it step by step. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see, the homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, so the characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's check: The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 +3, which is a_1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step or using the derived formula\u2014the result is 88572. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or use the derived formula. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you do a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and check each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe a better approach is to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if we can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier. Now, to find a closed-form formula, let's consider the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. However, just to make sure, let me compute it again using the closed-form approach. Compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} = 59049, then 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = (3*59049 - 3)/2. Let's compute 3*59049: 59049 * 3. Let's compute that: 50000*3=150000, 9000*3=27000, 40*3=120, 9*3=27. Adding up: 150000 + 27000 = 177000; 177000 + 120 = 177120; 177120 + 27 = 177147. So, 3*59049 = 177147. Then, subtract 3: 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, divide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, regardless of the method, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I can be certain that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with multiple layers of operations.

The innermost is 1 +3, which is layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))))))))) So, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1 +3 is the first. Then each step out adds another 1 +3*(...). So, let's count: 1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3( ... ). Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, I think my initial count was correct, with 9 layers. So, each layer from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and prone to error, though in this case, I think I did it correctly. Let me think if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This is similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^n + 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, as a_1=4. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as we computed a_2=13. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, as a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Units place: 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carry over 0. 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place: 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that by another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Wait, but I just thought of something. When I was computing Layer 9, I assumed that the expression after the innermost parentheses was 1 + 3, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each time it's (1 + 3(...)), so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times the pattern \"1 + 3(\" occurs before the first closing parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Then moving out, the next is (1 + 3(1 + 3)), which is Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Next, (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n4. And so on, until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3(, it's 1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: Each time I have a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let me write the expression with each layer labeled.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).

So, I think I correctly calculated up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. If Layer 8 is 9841, then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that again: 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_1 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try that. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit more involved. However, the closed-form formula seems to have worked well, so perhaps that's the most efficient way to approach it. In any case, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Let me count the number of layers: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3*(...) is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, that's nine layers. So, I think my computation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Sometimes, these kinds of expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, and so on, as I computed before. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.

Wait, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it from left to right, it's 8 (from the 2*3 + carry), then 8 (from 9*3 + carry), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, let me verify that by another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\nThen, 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\nThen, 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\nThen, 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\nThen, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make an error there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524, correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73 = 60000\n9000 \u00d73 = 27000\n500 \u00d73 = 1500\n20 \u00d73 = 60\n4 \u00d73 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that adds up to 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think I counted 9 layers because each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, starting from the innermost. So, each time I computed a layer, I was moving one step out. So, 9 layers in total, and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, starting from 1 + 3. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, then a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., up to a_9.\n\nAlternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1 is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me try to find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, B. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B +1 \u2192 B -3B =1 \u2192 -2B=1 \u2192 B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition, a_1=4. So,\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the recurrence relation formula.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Therefore, the final result should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case there's a shortcut. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that's correct. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(1 - r)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, let me check: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, where r is the root of the characteristic equation. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Now, in our case, c = 1, and r = 3. So, the particular solution is K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works for all the layers I computed earlier. So, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the original problem, we have a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier. So, using both the iterative method and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be extra sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula. For example, a_10 would be (3^{11} - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. Wait, that's interesting because 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which is just one less than a_10. That makes sense because each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, 3*a_{n-1} = a_n - 1. Therefore, 3*a_9 = a_{10} - 1 = 88573 - 1 = 88572, which matches our earlier result. That's a good consistency check. So, everything lines up correctly. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and with n=9, the value would be (3^{10} - 1)/2, leading to the same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or find the general formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using this pattern, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, following the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression without breaking it into layers, just to see if I get the same result. Let me try that. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). That's 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can write a small program or use a calculator to verify. But since I don't have a calculator here, I'll just do another check. Alternatively, I can think about the pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me find B. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting into the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check: If a_1 corresponds to n=1, then a_9 would be n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the innermost value is found to be 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. The final value of the innermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 =0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that would be (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result. So, using the formula directly, we can compute it without going through each layer.\n\nThat's pretty efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's good to recognize the pattern and derive a formula to solve it in logarithmic time instead of linear time.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the recurrence relation and finding its closed-form solution, we can compute the value much more efficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the recurrence relation and deriving a closed-form formula, we can compute the value efficiently.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer \\(a_n\\) is defined as:\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\nwith \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\nThe closed-form solution for \\(a_n\\) is:\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\):\n\\[ a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the number is 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4, I got 88,572 as well. So, that's correct.

Let me consider that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4, as before.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before.

Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can try to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, then: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was working it out step by step, it was a good exercise. I think I've got it right. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with the first few layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10}/2 -1/2). So, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10}/2 -1/2) = (3^{11}/2) - 3/2. 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147/2 - 3/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same result, and I double-checked each step in the recursive computation. So, yeah, that's how I would approach solving this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Wait, so 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27,000 + 2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. As computed earlier, that's 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me check the initial problem again to ensure I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. So, in the given expression, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's (1+3). Then moving out, each time we have another (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 1+3(1+3(...)) sections. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3).\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1+3(1+3)).\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3))).\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost expression.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many times does 1+3(...) occur? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which itself has another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time there's a \"(\", so let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).

Wait, no, let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3))\n\nWait, that's 10 layers, but the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me recount:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3.

(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n10. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, perhaps I had it right initially with 9 layers, each starting from the innermost. So, Layer 1 is (1+3) = 4, Layer 2 is (1 + 3*4) = 13, and so on up to Layer 9 = 29,524, and then 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, I think my initial calculation was correct, and the answer is 88,572. To be thorough, let me write down each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to get lost. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.

The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Setting a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.

Therefore, the outermost layer, which is a_9, is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just for knowledge, let's see if we can find a pattern. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That is, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Yep, same result. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " So writing it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that gives 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me recount them. The original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So I correctly computed up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So this method also gives the same result, which confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, let's write the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{9+1} -1)/2=3*(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recount each step. Starting from the innermost: Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, it's also 88572.

    "text": " So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6+1=7, carry 0, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27+1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value inside the parentheses after all layers is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did before. So, the value we're looking for is 3*a_9. Now, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. If I expand it all, maybe I can write it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)))) and so on. Let me try expanding it step by step to see if a pattern emerges. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Wait, but that's the same as the original problem. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can model it as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found a closed-form formula for a_n, maybe that's the most efficient way. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then E = 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 =121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 =364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 =1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I did before. So, the solution is correct. Alternatively, we can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, but since the number of layers is only nine, it's probably faster to compute each step manually. But just for fun, let me try to find the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence relation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the closed-form approach also gives the same result, which reinforces that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that thought. The expression 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But since it's finite, with nine layers, it's a finite geometric series. The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is S_n = a1*(r^n -1)/(r -1), where a1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, each layer adds another term. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I consider the entire expression starting from the innermost, it's like each term is 1, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3. So, maybe the total sum can be represented as a geometric series with nine terms. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) up to nine layers. So, if I expand it, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). Wait, that's nine 1's and eight 3's? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me try to write it out more clearly. The innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each layer adds a term, but the number of terms isn't exactly matching a simple geometric series. However, using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here. Since we've already computed it step by step and verified with the closed-form solution, I think we're safe. So, to recap: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Using the recurrence, we computed up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the closed-form solution corroborates the step-by-step result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). This leads to a recurrence relation which can be solved either step-by-step or using a closed-form formula. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2.

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2 with carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, next digit. 5*3=15, 5 with carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8 with carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time I add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.

So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when I do it in my head, I might make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28.

Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, I arrive at the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, so it's a geometric progression in a way, but since each step is multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, it's more of a recursive sequence. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially. I remember that for such nested expressions, working from the inside out is the most efficient way to solve them without getting lost in the complexity.\n\nJust to recap, here's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1.

Maybe I made an error in one of the layers.\n\nStarting over, let's compute each layer step by step carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so that's correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm. But maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but when I started, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which is correct. So, nine layers in total. So, perhaps 88572 is indeed the correct answer. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\nSimplify the right side:\n3*A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n\nSo, right side becomes: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 (since there are nine layers), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. Each layer was computed correctly, and the closed-form solution also confirms the result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is the first. Then, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, in the original expression, after the initial 3(, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, the final computation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which is what I got earlier. Now, to find a general formula, let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this, we compute up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, the computation from the innermost layer up gives us a final result of 88572.

So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). It's like a recursive formula where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nLet me see if I can generalize this. Suppose I have n layers, each defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n can be computed as above.

Because Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So 1500 + 72 = 1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any earlier mistakes, let me go through the layers again quickly. Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 13. Layer 3: 40. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Then, the sequence would be a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., as I calculated earlier. So, the problem is to compute 3*a_9. Now, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

    "text": " So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me try a different approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the recurrence relation. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked each step, so I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.
