    "text": " So, putting it all together, we have 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off because when I write it down, the digits would be from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, no, let me do it again carefully. Let me write 29524 as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   *     3\n   ---------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units place):\n\n4 * 3 = 12. So, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nNext digit to the left: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Add the carried 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carried 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through the layers again to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the same as before. Now, is there a general formula for a_n? Let's see. It seems like each term is a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: a_p = 3a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, n = 9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3(Layer2))\n...\nUp to Layer9: (1 + 3(Layer8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as above.\n\nSo, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572?

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation here. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid now. I considered both the step-by-step computation and recognized a pattern that allowed me to use a formula, which confirmed the result. It's always good to check your work with a different method if possible, especially when dealing with repetitive or nested structures. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\), leading to a general solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for \\(n = 9\\) gives the value of the innermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3 to obtain the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any step. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. I computed each layer correctly, from 1 up to Layer 9, each time substituting the previous layer's result. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence goes: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, this recursive relation can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving the recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution was a good way to verify the result without having to compute each layer manually, which can be error-prone, especially with so many layers. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0. 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8. So, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the result should be 88572, which is 5 digits as well. Let me check 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see: Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I calculated earlier. Now, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, all checks out.

Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carryover 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds one more. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me try to parse it: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(that), and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time we have a new (1+3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is just 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, we have 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me confirm: The first layer after the 3 is (1+3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another one. So, if I have 9 layers, then my initial calculation is correct, with Layer 1 to Layer 9. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I multiplied 3*29524, I got 88572, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in that multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution for such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is the first layer, which is 4. So, n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. I think this makes sense because using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution saved me from computing each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, so it's similar to a geometric series, but with each term being built upon the previous one. The key was recognizing the pattern and finding the formula for a_n, which simplified the computation. So, after verifying both by step-by-step computation and by using the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because this seems a bit high. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the computations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 layers, maybe it's faster to compute each step as I did before. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nL1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\n\nL2 = 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nL3 = 40 = 1 + 3*13\n\nL4 = 121 = 1 + 3*40\n\nWait, let me see the pattern in the numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using the method for such equations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, as I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm it's 59,049.\n\nYes, 3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049. Correct.\n\nTherefore, L9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29,524 manually.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\n= (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, I started by computing each nested layer step by step, then noticed a pattern that allowed me to model the problem using a recurrence relation. I solved the recurrence to find a direct formula for each layer, which confirmed my step-by-step computations. Finally, I multiplied the outermost layer's result by 3 to get the final answer. This double-checking gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me just quickly go through the layers again to ensure each step was correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1,093=3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3,280=9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9,841=29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nMultiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute each layer directly, confirming our step-by-step calculations. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer's result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Recognizing the pattern, we use the formula for the nth layer: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check each layer computation because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something like that. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.

Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to 3^n + something, but given that each step is straightforward, perhaps it's better to compute each layer as I did. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer again.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together from the last carryover: 8, then 8, then 5, then 7, then 2. So that's 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is a recursive structure. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without manually computing each layer. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This seems to follow the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3/2) - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4/2) - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check that again. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841. So, 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. So, that seems right.\n\nBut let me verify each layer again just to be sure. Maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which we computed as 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right approach. Each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. So, starting from the innermost, each step builds on the previous one, and after nine layers, we get to Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step seems logical, and the numbers add up correctly. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated, and finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3 * 9841: 9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, 1 * 3 = 3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Wait, hold on! That's different from what I had before. Wait, so 3 * 9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3: 9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, 1 * 3 = 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 should be 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but 3*9841 is 29523, so adding 1 gives 29524. So that part is correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So that seems correct. Hmm, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of closing parentheses, each layer adds one. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each next layer wraps around. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, from the innermost: 1+3, then each time you go out, you add another 1+3. So, how many layers? Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the initial expression is 3(...). Inside that, it's 1+3(...). So, the first layer is 1+3(...). Then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on until the innermost 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 wraps around that: 1+3(Layer1). Layer3: 1+3(Layer2). Continuing until Layer9: 1+3(Layer8). So, total layers from 1 to 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that should be the answer. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, instead of nine layers, let's try with one layer. If the expression was 3(1+3). Then, that would be 3*(1+3) = 3*4 = 12. Correct. If it's two layers: 3(1+3(1+3)). Compute innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. So, 39. Let's compute using my method: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Final answer:3*13=39. Correct. Now, three layers: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Compute Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Final answer:3*40=120. Let me compute directly: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))) = 3*(1+3*(1+9)) = 3*(1+3*10) = 3*(1+30) = 3*31=93. Wait, that's different. Wait, did I make a mistake? Wait, if it's three layers: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute innermost first: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. But when I computed directly, I got 93. Hmm, that's conflicting. So, which one is correct? Wait, let me compute directly: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) Compute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. So, that's correct. But when I did it step by step before, I thought I got 93, but that must have been a miscalculation. Wait, let me check again: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) step by step: Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. So, correct. So, my method works for three layers. So, perhaps my initial thought of 93 was wrong. So, the method is correct. Therefore, for nine layers, the answer should be 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute four layers manually. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))). Compute innermost: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Then, 3*121=363. Let me compute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) Innermost:1+3=4. Next:1+3*4=13. Next:1+3*13=40. Next:1+3*40=121. Then, 3*121=363. Correct. So, my method is consistent. Therefore, going back to the original problem with nine layers, the answer should indeed be 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to recap, I computed each layer starting from the innermost, which was 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the ninth layer, which was 29524, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I also verified this method with smaller numbers of layers, and it worked correctly each time. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward and less error-prone. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me recall that for a geometric series, the sum S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). But in this case, each term is 1, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3. However, because each layer is added to 1 before being multiplied by 3, it's not exactly a standard geometric series. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, computing each a_i step by step is what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to see the pattern. Starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, this seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of each a_n as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*(29524)=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

    "text": " Wait, that would be 29524 * 3 = 88572? Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Because each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, 29524*3=88572. So, the total expression evaluates to 88572. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me confirm each step because it's easy to make a mistake in these calculations. Let me recast the problem as a recursive computation. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Starting with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent.

Each layer seems to be calculated correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is defined by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that approach. Let me set up the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L(4) = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step. Let me denote the innermost part as A = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3*A, but wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's more like each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding the entire expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me define each layer as before, L1 to L9. Then, E = 3*L9, and L9 = 1 + 3*L8, etc., which is the same as before. So, perhaps the expansion approach isn't necessary since we've already solved it using the recursive method and the closed-form formula. But just to satisfy my curiosity, let me see if I can write E as a sum. Let me consider that each time we have a 1 being multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, because there are 8 layers above it. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. But wait, actually, in the expression, each 1 is part of a term that's being multiplied by 3 at each layer. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nLet me try to write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, expanding this, E = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3*1. Wait, but how many terms are there? Each time we have a 1, and each time we add a 3 multiplier. Let me count the number of 1s. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1. So, in total, how many 1s are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1. So, from L1 to L9, each layer has a 1. So, there are 9 ones. Therefore, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))) can be expanded as 3*(1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1). Wait, but that might not be accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so the expansion would be more like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each layer adds a 3 multiplier to the previous layers. Let me try to write this as a sum. Let me see, if I have 9 layers, then the innermost term is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplier. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(something). So, when we expand it, it becomes 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(something else)). So, if we keep expanding, we'll get a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Therefore, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) can be written as E = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k). Wait, but let me check. The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3 multiplier, so the next term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0? Wait, no, that's not accurate. Wait, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. So, each layer adds a new power of 3. Therefore, the outermost expression would be E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) = 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Because each layer adds another power of 3. So, the sum inside is a geometric series from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) where n is the number of terms. Here, n=9, so the sum is (3^9 - 1)/2. Therefore, E = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = (3^{10} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 3 = 59046. Then, 59046 / 2 = 29523. Wait, but that's not matching what I had before. Wait, earlier I had E = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But according to this, E = (3^{10} - 3)/2 = 29523. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, where did I go wrong here?\n\nWait, let's check the sum. The sum inside is from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2. So, the sum is (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But wait, earlier I had E = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That's a conflict. So, clearly, one of these approaches is wrong. Let me figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, in the recursive approach, I had L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in the sum approach, I thought that E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*19682/2 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute E in another way. Let me compute E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me compute this step by step again, but this time, using the expansion approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, according to this step-by-step computation, E = 88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, I got E = 29523, which is different. Therefore, my sum approach must be wrong. Let me figure out why.\n\nWait, in the sum approach, I assumed that E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). But that might not be accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so the expansion isn't simply adding up 3^k terms. Let me see. Let's take a smaller example to test.\n\nSuppose we have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost layer: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, using the sum approach: E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k) = 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 3*13 = 39. Which matches the step-by-step computation. So, in this case, the sum approach works.\n\nWait, but in the previous case, with n=3 layers, it worked. So, why in the case of n=9 layers, it didn't match? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of terms. Let me check.\n\nIn the case where there are 3 layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, E = 3*13 = 39. The sum approach: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, then E = 3*13 = 39. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, if we have 4 layers: innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, E = 3*40 = 120. Using the sum approach: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, then E = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nWait, so in the 9-layer case, the sum should be from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But according to the step-by-step computation, E = 88572. That's a conflict. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the sum approach. Wait, no, in the 4-layer example, the sum was from k=0 to 3, which is 4 terms, corresponding to 3^0 to 3^3. Similarly, for 9 layers, it should be from k=0 to 8, which is 9 terms. Therefore, the sum inside should be (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, and E = 3*9841 = 29523. But according to the step-by-step computation, E = 88572, which is 3*29524, where 29524 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the discrepancy arises because the sum approach gives E = 3*(3^9 - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523, while the step-by-step approach gives E = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 * 3 = (59049 - 1)/2 * 3 = 59048/2 *3 = 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, so which one is correct? Let me compute E for the 3-layer case using both methods. Step-by-step: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39. Sum approach: E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k) = 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nFor 4 layers: step-by-step gives E=120, sum approach gives E=3*(sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k)=3*(1+3+9+27)=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nWait, so in the 9-layer case, why does the sum approach give a different result? Let me check the 9-layer case again. If I use the sum approach, E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523. But step-by-step computation gives E = 88572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561. Let me add these up step by step:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n4 + 9 = 13\n\n13 + 27 = 40\n\n40 + 81 = 121\n\n121 + 243 = 364\n\n364 + 729 = 1093\n\n1093 + 2187 = 3280\n\n3280 + 6561 = 9841\n\nSo, the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is indeed 9841. Therefore, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But according to the step-by-step computation, E = 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step computation again. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, which one is correct? Let me check the initial problem statement again. The problem is: Compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, in the step-by-step approach, Layer 9 is 29524, and E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in the sum approach, I thought that E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but in the 3-layer example, the sum approach worked because the sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k is 13, and E = 3*13 = 39, which matches the step-by-step computation. Similarly, for 4 layers, sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k is 40, E = 3*40 = 120, which matches. So, why in the 9-layer case, the sum approach gives a different result?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum approach. Let me think again. The sum approach assumes that E = 3*(sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k), where n is the number of layers. But in the step-by-step approach, each layer is 1 + 3*L(n-1), which leads to L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and E = 3*L(9) = 88572.\n\nBut in the sum approach, I thought that E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523. So, which is correct? Let me compute E for n=3 using both methods.\n\nUsing step-by-step: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nUsing sum approach: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, E = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nNow, using the closed-form formula: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=3, L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Then, E = 3*L(3) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, but that's different from the step-by-step computation which gave E=39 for n=3. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no, in the n=3 case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let me compute that:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nBut according to the closed-form formula, L(3) = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is different from the step-by-step result of 13. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the closed-form formula.\n\nWait, in the closed-form formula, I defined L(n) as the value at each layer, starting from L(1) = 4. Then, L(2) = 13, L(3)=40, etc. So, for n=3, L(3)=40. But in the step-by-step computation, the outermost layer is 3*13=39, which is E=39. So, the closed-form formula gives L(3)=40, but E=3*L(3)=120, which doesn't match the step-by-step result of E=39. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the closed-form formula.\n\nWait, no, in the closed-form formula, L(n) is the value of the nth layer, not the entire expression E. So, for n=3 layers, L(3)=40, but E = 3*L(3) = 120. But in the step-by-step computation, E=39. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the closed-form formula.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the derivation of the closed-form formula. I had L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution is a constant B, so B = 1 + 3*B => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A = 1.5.\n\nThus, L(n) = 1.5*3^n - 0.5 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 0.5.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2)/2 - 0.5 = 9/2 - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3)/2 - 0.5 = 27/2 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4)/2 - 0.5 = 81/2 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, L(3)=40, and E=3*L(3)=120. But in the step-by-step computation, E=39. Therefore, I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the 3-layer example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, which is L1=4. Then, L2=1 + 3*4=13, L3=1 + 3*13=40. Then, E=3*L3=120. But when I computed it step-by-step, I only went two layers out, getting E=39. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the 3-layer example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is L1=4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 =13, which is L2=13. Then, the outermost is 3*L2=39, which is E=39. Therefore, in this case, the number of layers is 2, not 3. So, perhaps the number of layers is one less than the number of nested parentheses. Therefore, in the original problem, which has nine sets of parentheses, the number of layers is 9, leading to L(9)=29524 and E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the 3-layer example, the number of parentheses is 3, but the number of layers is 2, leading to L(2)=13 and E=39. Therefore, the number of layers is equal to the number of parentheses minus one. Therefore, in the original problem, with nine parentheses, the number of layers is 9, leading to L(9)=29524 and E=88572.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is correct, and the sum approach was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum approach needs to be adjusted. Let me think about this again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, for n layers, the value is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The closed-form solution is L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, E = 3*L(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn the 3-layer example, n=3, so E = (3^5 - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. But when I computed the 3-layer example step-by-step, I got E=39, which is different. Therefore, perhaps the number of layers is different.\n\nWait, in the 3-layer example, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, which is L1=4. Then, L2=1 + 3*4=13, and E=3*L2=39. So, in this case, n=2 layers, leading to E=(3^{4} - 3)/2=(81 -3)/2=78/2=39. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula E = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, in the original problem, with 9 layers, E = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the correct formula is E = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2, where n is the number of layers. In the original problem, n=9, so E = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, to wrap up, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize a pattern where each layer is defined as $L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1)$, starting from the innermost layer. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. \n\nUsing the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the outermost expression is $88572$.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572"

Yes, that seems correct because 30000 * 3 = 90000, and 29524 is slightly less, so 88572 makes sense. So, the final answer should be 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, so each layer is a geometric series perhaps? Maybe I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let me consider that approach. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The standard solution for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the expression is 3*a_9, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same answer. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's denote Layer n as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution instead of computing each term step by step. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, the result is the same.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute them incorrectly. Let's go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n goes from 1 to 9. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2, which is (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). I computed each layer starting from the innermost one, which gave me 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplied the outermost layer by 3, resulting in 88572. I also verified using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, both leading to the same result. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, yes, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expression using another method, just to cross-verify.

Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom (units to highest place), we get 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So, the number is 88,572? Wait, 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572? Wait, that seems high. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that makes sense. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go back step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So, that seems right. Wait, but let me confirm the multiplication again because sometimes when I do it step by step, I might miscount the carries. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took. Each layer was computed correctly, starting from the inside, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner layer by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4.

That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a recursive relation. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursion. Let me define a_n as the value at each layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is (3^{n} - 1)/2, so for n layers, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3. But in this case, since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3. But wait, no, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). It's a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer adds 1 and then multiplies by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did before. So, since it's a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, so let a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, the expression inside is 1 + 3*(something), so it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. But since it's finite (nine layers), it's more of a finite geometric series. Wait, but in this case, each term is added, not multiplied. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since I've already got the answer using two methods and both agree, I think 88572 is the correct result. So, to recap: I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, which gave me 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplied by 3 to get 88572. I also solved the recurrence relation and found a formula that gave me the same result for the ninth layer, which when multiplied by 3 gave the same final answer.

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: positions are ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This recurrence relation can be solved. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Starting from the innermost layer, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, if I expand the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and as I solved earlier, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression without using the formula, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me compute each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, same result each time. I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(...). So, if I expand each layer, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try expanding it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, no, 3^1 is 3, 3 +1=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3*1? Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express each layer as a sum of powers of 3. Let me think.\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nLet me see how many times 3 appears. Each time, it's multiplied by another term. So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, perhaps E can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, if I let E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers, then perhaps E can be written as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + something. Wait, no, that might not be accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(...), so it's more like each layer adds 1 and then multiplies by 3. So, perhaps it's a geometric series with a twist.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, since each layer is multiplied by 3, perhaps I can express E as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try.\n\nWait, when I have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers, perhaps it's similar to E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + 3^10*(1). Wait, but that might not be exactly correct because each term is 1 + 3*next term, so it's more like each term is 1 + 3*(sum of the next terms). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since I already have the step-by-step computation and the formula approach both leading to 88572, maybe that's sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as I derived earlier. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Thus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such a sequence. Let's denote a_n as the nth term. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's plug the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: a_1 = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for a_n, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the general solution to the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each term is defined recursively. So, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. But since I only had 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). It's a geometric series inside out. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. At n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. At n=0: Hmm, but n=0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps we can express it differently. Alternatively, let's consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*a_9, which would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I got the same result, so I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we add another 1+3(...). So, yes, 9 layers, which is a_9. Therefore, the formula applies correctly.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. The formula we derived accounts for that.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. It's always good to check using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can get confusing. But breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped solidify that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all 9 layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step again because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the manual computation.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined by:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1)\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. The recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3 * Layer (n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = C * 3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say Layer n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3 * A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C * 3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C * 3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, Layer n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because n starts at 1 for the innermost, so Layer 9 would be n=9. So, Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Therefore, I didn't make a mistake in my manual computation. It's just that the number is large, but the process is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the formula Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, ultimately leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So, the final answer would be 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I did the layers correctly because that seems like a big number. Let me retrace each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 seem correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nTo find D, we can solve for the steady-state value. Let D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again matches. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is similar to the expansion of (1/2)*(3^{n} - 1). Wait, but earlier we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

Wait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. So, that matches the previous calculation where a_9 = 29524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can use this formula to compute each layer without computing each step, but since I already did it step by step, it's fine. I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, writing the digits together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation of each layer. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer adds another 3*... So, perhaps the total expression is 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 + 1 ). Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, from the recurrence, we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each '1' is being multiplied by 3 raised to a certain power. So, expanding it, perhaps it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me try to write it as a sum:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 3. Then, moving out, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the innermost is 3, then 1 + 3*3 = 10, but wait, no. Wait, in my initial computation, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, not 1 + 3*3. Wait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the expression can be represented as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total expression is 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ). Wait, but that's similar to what we had before.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula. Let me try:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing the innermost layers, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me verify my computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1:1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, as this might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see how this applies. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, a_9 would be the value at the 9th layer. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach or a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value before the outermost multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"
