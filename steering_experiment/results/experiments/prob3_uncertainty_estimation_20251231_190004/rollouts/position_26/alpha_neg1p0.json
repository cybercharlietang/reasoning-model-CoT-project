Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. Wait, let me check that. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me break that down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 5, 7, 2, 4. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n________\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute it as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different from the digit-by-digit method. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that's 877572? No, that can't be right because the original number is 29524, which is a 5-digit number. Multiplying by 3, it should still be a 5-digit number. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I got 877572, which is obviously wrong because that's a 6-digit number. So, I must have miscounted the digits when writing them down. Let me try writing it correctly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that's 877572, but that's not correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. So, I must have misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me try again, keeping track of each digit's place:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n________\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Thousands place: 7.\n\nTen-thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Ten-thousands place: 7, carryover 2.\n\nHundred-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Hundred-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would make it 877572, but that's a 6-digit number, which can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, which is a 5-digit number. I must have made a mistake in the digit places. Let me try a different approach: write each digit's result in the correct place.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nNow, when we write the result, we start from the units place and move left:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 7\n- Ten-thousands: 7\n- Hundred-thousands: 8\n\nWait, that would be 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, the number is 877572. But that's not correct because 29524 \u00d7 3 is definitely 88572, as shown by the earlier method. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check the original number: 29524. It's a 5-digit number. So, when multiplying by 3, the result should be a 5-digit number. So, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing down the result. Let me try again, aligning each digit correctly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nBut wait, the original number is 29524, which has digits: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying, each digit corresponds to its place:\n\n- Units: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units digit: 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit: 7.\n- Hundreds: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds digit: 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Thousands digit: 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands digit: 8.\n\nWait, so that's different. I think I messed up the places earlier. Let me write it correctly:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Units: 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens: 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Hundreds: 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands: 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands: 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together from ten-thousands to units: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88572. Ah, there we go! So, the correct result is 88572. I must have misaligned the digits earlier when I thought it was 877572. So, the correct multiplication is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed correctly up to Layer 9, which was 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. I'll do a quick check with a different method. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula for a_n in terms of n. Since each term is a linear recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I think I did this correctly, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, which is the innermost part before the final multiplication by 3. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the sequence of a_n, it seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me recall how to solve such recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this confirms the result I obtained earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form formula, which confirms the result when computed layer by layer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, with the outermost layer multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the final result**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, hold on, maybe I should write it out properly. Let me write 29524 multiplied by 3:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That matches what I got before. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me check each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the result. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, and then multiply by 3, I get 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it sufficiently through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and closed-form formula. All lead to the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern to generalize the computation, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step seems manageable. However, just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can provide a more efficient way to compute the result without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work fine. So, to summarize, the expression simplifies as follows:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), leading up to the ninth layer being 29,524.\n\nFinally, multiply this by 3 to get the total: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Starting from the inside: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_1 = 4. So, plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, for n=2: a_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A = 3/2 into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of multiplications by 3 and additions of 1. Each time, you're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). After n steps, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. As we saw earlier, this is a linear recurrence relation, and we found a closed-form solution. So, using that, we can compute a_9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Either way, the answer comes out to 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the final multiplication again: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, let's compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check each step because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait a second. I just realized that the original problem has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, that's correct, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. That seems right. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences: 1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, there are nine layers in total. So, my initial calculation of Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, the result should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have just one layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*(4) = 12. Correct. Two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 9) = 3*10 = 30. Alternatively, using the layer method: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4; Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13; total expression: 3*13 = 39. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, wait, no, because in two layers, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let me compute that: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4; then 3*4 = 12; then 1 + 12 = 13; then 3*13 = 39. So, yes, 39. But if I compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. So, the layer method works here. Similarly, with three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Using the layer method: Layer 1: 4; Layer 2: 13; Layer 3: 40; total: 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the pattern holds. Therefore, my calculation for nine layers should be correct, resulting in 88,572. But just to be extra cautious, let me compute the layers again step by step to ensure no arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I had 1,093 as Layer 6, but in my first calculation, I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. So, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make sure, let me try computing it using another approach. Maybe recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something. Wait, let's see: Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, using the recurrence relation method also leads us to the same answer, confirming that 88,572 is indeed the correct result. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20,000 is 60,000, 3 times 9,000 is 27,000, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 24 is 72. Adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just visualize the entire expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous layer. Since there are nine layers, each time we compute a new layer, we're moving one step outward. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, computing each layer step by step seems like the right approach. I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer step by step, but breaking it down made it manageable. I was worried at first that I might have missed a layer or miscalculated somewhere, but going through each step carefully seems to have paid off. I guess the key takeaway here is that when dealing with nested expressions like this, working from the inside out is the most efficient way to tackle the problem without getting lost in the complexity. It also helps to label each layer so that you can keep track of where you are in the computation. Overall, it was a good exercise in methodical problem-solving. I didn't encounter any roadblocks once I broke it down, but I can see how someone might get overwhelmed if they tried to compute the entire expression all at once. Taking it one step at a time really made all the difference.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, no. Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yes.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Right.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me confirm using another method. Maybe I can compute 29524*3 directly.\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, and there are nine \"1+\"s inside. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. From the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n4. 1+3(1+3(...\n5. 1+3(1+3(...\n6. 1+3(1+3(...\n7. 1+3(1+3(...\n8. 1+3(1+3(...\n9. 1+3(1+3))\n10. Then closing parentheses.\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, my initial counting was correct with nine layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, the final result after computing Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers of 1+3*(...). So, my initial calculation of nine layers is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try to compute it in a different way, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*C - 1/2 = 4\nSo, 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nCompute a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\na_2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as computed earlier.\n\na_3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, starting from 4, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, but actually, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar but slightly different.\n\nBut using the closed-form formula is more efficient and confirms the result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it holds.\n\nCompute a_4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches our earlier result.\n\na_5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works perfectly, and it's consistent with our step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Hmm, let me just verify that I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Maybe I can check a couple of the layers again. Let's check Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13, that's correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121, that's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572, which seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, so maybe we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we had before. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 0.5 => 3*C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. Good. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. So, perhaps expanding this would result in a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but I need to think carefully about how it's structured. Wait, when I expand the expression, each layer adds another term. Let me try to see what the expansion would look like. Starting from the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine 3s. So, perhaps the expanded form would be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}, but let me check.\n\nWait, let me think about how many terms there are. Each time we have a term that's 3 times the previous, so maybe the total expression is a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=10, but let me check.\n\nWait, when we compute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer adds another power of 3. Therefore, Layer n would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series. The sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^{n} is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer starts with 1, which is 3^0, then adds 3^1, then 3^2, etc. So, Layer 1: 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, but in our problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when we expand it, it's like each layer adds another term. So, maybe the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, would be 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9.\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 19683.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which would be 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is 3 times the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach the problem, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use induction or another method, but since I've already got the answer using both step-by-step computation and the geometric series approach, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify the final multiplication: 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, after carefully working through each layer, verifying each step, and cross-checking using the geometric series approach, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

So, the final answer should be 88572. But let me think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous. I think I did that correctly. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the process seems right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Let me try that.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = k*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = k*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = k*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3k - 1/2 => 3k = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => k = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, that might be a quicker way to compute it. Let me check what 3^{11} is. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same answer I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer individually or use the recurrence relation method, I end up with 88572 as the result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence approach, let me verify the formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 should be 13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=40. Formula: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=121. Formula: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=364. Formula: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=1093. Formula: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=3280. Formula: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=9841. Formula: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=29524. Formula: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly, which gives me more confidence in the answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Using both iterative computation and a recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to see if I messed up somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*841=2,523. So 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me break that down: 29524 * 3.

Correct. Then Layer 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression is a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify with another method to be sure. Maybe using distributive property or recognizing a pattern.\n\nWait a second, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive formula. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me think: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's the same result as before. So, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut since each term is built upon the previous one, it's a bit different. The closed-form approach seems more straightforward here.\n\nLet me just confirm the arithmetic one more time to be absolutely sure.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step would be to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let's do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 24*3=72, carry over 7. 524*3=1,572, plus 7 is 1,579. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, I should compute digit by digit: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 88,572. Wait, but when I did 29,524 * 3, I get 88,572, yes. So that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost is 3 times that. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time moving out, adding another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time moving out, so the number of layers is 9. Because each time you have a 1+3(...) structure, starting from the innermost. So, layer 1: 1+3, layer 2: 1+3*(layer1), up to layer9: 1+3*(layer8), and then the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, that's correct. So, my calculation seems accurate. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my multiplication again because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait a second, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+...). There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct. Therefore, my calculation of Layer 9 being 29524 is correct, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is similar to a geometric series. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Using the closed-form solution, I can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step. This might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods are manageable. So, to recap, the expression evaluates to 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the multiplication just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the total is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. But just to explore, maybe there's a formula I can use here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write this as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have continued computing each layer step by step, but recognizing the recurrence relation made it much quicker, especially for larger numbers of layers. So, in summary, by either method, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. I can break this down as 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 = 87,000. 3*524: Let's compute 3*500 = 1,500 and 3*24 = 72. So, 1,500 + 72 = 1,572. Now, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct.

Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524, correct. Now, the final step is 3*29,524.

Alternatively, 29,524*3 can be calculated as (30,000 - 476)*3 = 90,000 - (476*3). Let's compute 476*3: 400*3=1,200; 70*3=210; 6*3=18. So, 1,200 + 210 = 1,410 + 18 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that matches my earlier result. So, the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them: Starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So, Layers 1 through 9, which I computed correctly. So, 3*(Layer9)=88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with repeated multiplication and addition.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. If a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving this recurrence, we find that \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3, the result is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9): 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Breaking it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nMultiply each digit from right to left:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct. So, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems to be correct. Then, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSo, left side: C*3^{n} + D\n\nRight side: 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSet them equal:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9 because there are nine layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive approach, or find a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the different methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed recursively. Using the recursive formula or a closed-form solution, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because the original expression starts with 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9, I have to multiply that result by 3. So, yes, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, each layer is correctly computed, and the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if that's the case. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Yes, same as before. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. How many layers are there? The original expression has 9 layers, so n=9. So, we can compute a_9. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.
