    "text": " Wait, 5 is in the hundreds place, so the next digit is 2 (from 29524). So, 2 * 3 = 6. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      ? ? ? ? ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, no, because we started from the right, so the digits would be 2,7,5,8,8. So the number would be 88572? Let me check that again. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me write it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit: 2, carryover: 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit: 7, carryover: 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit: 5, carryover: 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit: 8, carryover: 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands digit: 8.\n\nSo, writing it from left to right, it's 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me verify that with another method. 29,524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. But 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses inside the main 3(...). Let me count them again. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Each additional (1+3(...)) adds another layer. So, yes, 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation here: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, actually, for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form L_n = c*L_{n-1} + d, the solution is L_n = c^{n}*(L_0 - d/(c-1)) + d/(c-1). In this case, c = 3, d = 1, and L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, let's see. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. Here, a = 3, b = 1. The solution is L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + (b*(a^{n} - 1))/(a - 1). But in our case, L_1 = 4, so perhaps L_0 would be something else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute a few terms and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nWe have:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found as a constant, say L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a recurrence relation to find a formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, confirming the value of the ninth layer as 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, 9 is the next digit, but 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Then 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. Then 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Then 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. Then 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my layers again because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. But to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8 is 9841, so 3 * 9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_h + a_p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 (n=9) would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see the entire expression as a geometric series, but given that each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found a closed-form solution, it's probably more straightforward to use the recurrence relation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to see if it's consistent.\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = 243 -1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the values. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Using a recurrence relation, each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), the value is 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, right? So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer2 as 1 + 3*4=13, Layer3=1 + 3*13=40, Layer4=1 + 3*40=121, Layer5=1 + 3*121=364, Layer6=1 + 3*364=1093, Layer7=1 + 3*1093=3280, Layer8=1 + 3*3280=9841, Layer9=1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers. Let me count the number of times I added a layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) =13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)=40\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*(Layer3)=121\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*(Layer4)=364\n\nLayer6:1 + 3*(Layer5)=1093\n\nLayer7:1 + 3*(Layer6)=3280\n\nLayer8:1 + 3*(Layer7)=9841\n\nLayer9:1 + 3*(Layer8)=29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, so the computation seems correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a particular solution. Let me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by computing each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, all these steps check out. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems to be the correct answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me try computing the entire expression step by step again, but this time perhaps using a different approach or looking for a pattern. Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let me think about it. If I define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9, then the total expression is 3*a9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nWait, let me see. The recursive formula is a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems to confirm my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it another way. Let's compute the expression step by step without using the formula, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could also compute this using the formula I derived earlier. Since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the calculations. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested parentheses from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, 5 is in the hundreds place, so the next digit is 5. Wait, no, let me count the digits properly. 29524 is a five-digit number: positions are ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units. So, digits are: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from units: 4 * 3 = 12. Units digit: 2, carryover 1. Next, tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens digit: 7, carryover 0. Next, hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds digit: 5, carryover 1. Next, thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands digit: 8, carryover 2. Next, ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten thousands digit: 8. So, writing it all together, we have 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. Wait, that seems right: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Let me verify that with another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me just double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let's go back through each layer computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f So, all the layers check out. Each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be represented by a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's possible here. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... Up to L_9, then the total expression is 3*L_9. So, if I can find a general formula for L_n, that might help. Let's see: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, especially since it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by: L_n = (L_1 - b/(1 - a)) * a^{n - 1} + b/(1 - a) Wait, but in our case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so 1 - a is negative, and we have to be careful with the signs. Alternatively, another way to express it is: The homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution, which is a constant since the non-homogeneous term is a constant. Let's assume a particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've thought this through thoroughly, checking each step and even deriving a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Next one, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer. Let me count the number of layers correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nEach time we have a (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next layer is (1+3(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then (1+3(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\n4. Then (1+3(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4\n5. Then (1+3(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5\n6. Then (1+3(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6\n7. Then (1+3(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7\n8. Then (1+3(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8\n9. Then (1+3(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, my earlier computation was correct with 9 layers, ending up with Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence relation into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a geometric series. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Using the closed-form formula, as I did above, is more efficient, especially for a larger number of layers, but since we only have nine, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers are correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572 is the correct final answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(... nine times ...))). So, after computing the innermost nine layers, the result is 29524, and then we multiply by 3, giving 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series but with a different structure. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the original expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))), it's like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but starting from 1 and adding 1 each time. But in this case, it's more of a linear recurrence, which we've already solved.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each layer is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, which grows exponentially because each step is multiplied by 3. So, the nth term is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, as we found.\n\nTherefore, after computing all layers up to n=9, we get 29524, multiply by 3, and get 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula checks out with each step. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. The recurrence relation is solved to find a general formula, which is then applied to compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: The nth term of the sequence can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For n=9, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach led me to the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems correct. Let me check: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = b^n * L_0 + a*(b^n - 1)/(b - 1), assuming b \u2260 1. Wait, let me check that formula. Actually, the standard form is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*b^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a + b*K => K - b*K = a => K*(1 - b) = a => K = a/(1 - b). Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*b^n + a/(1 - b). Applying initial conditions, say L_0 = 1 (since the innermost layer is 1 + 3, but wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which would be L_1 = 4. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me see: If I consider Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then L_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, so L_2 = 13. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, using the recurrence formula, the general solution would be L_n = C*3^n + a/(1 - b), where a = 1, b = 3. So, L_n = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

    "text": " Wait, 9 is in the thousands place? Wait, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, 4 units. So, when multiplying by 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 =15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 =27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 =6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000*3=90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476*3)=90000 - 1428=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step again because sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but in a nested form. Alternatively, it's similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2)=3A -1/2. So, 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} directly to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so a_9=(59049-1)/2=29524. Therefore, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it, it's like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to 3^8, but multiplied by some factor. Wait, let me see. Let me expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: 1 +3=4. Then, 1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Then, 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121, etc. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see the pattern. Let me denote the innermost expression as a_1=1+3=4. Then, a_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +3*4=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40. a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121. a_5=1 +3*121=364. a_6=1 +3*364=1093. a_7=1 +3*1093=3280. a_8=1 +3*3280=9841. a_9=1 +3*9841=29524. So, each a_n is 1 +3*a_{n-1}. And as we saw, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, if I think of the expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine layers, it's equivalent to 3*(a_9). Which is 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, let me check that. Because 3*a_9=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same answer as before. So, that's another way to look at it: the expression is (3^{11}-3)/2=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's consistent across all methods I've tried. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can find the solution efficiently. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem isn't too long, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which might have saved some time, but since I already computed each layer, perhaps it's not necessary. But for future reference, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. But in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, let me check: the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, but 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches the earlier result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. But since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nSo, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we found that the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous value), leading up to Layer 9 being 29524.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Suppose I have an expression of the form a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), n times. This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a + b*(previous term). Let me denote the nth term as T(n). Then, T(n) = a + b*T(n-1). With T(1) = a + b. Wait, in our problem, a is 1, and b is 3. So, T(n) = 1 + 3*T(n-1). So, starting from T(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did before. Then, T(2) = 1 + 3*T(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to T(9). So, our approach is correct. The general solution for such a recurrence is T(n) = (b^n - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is T(n) = a + b*T(n-1). If a = 1 and b = 3, then T(n) = 1 + 3*T(n-1). The homogeneous solution is T(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution T_p. So, T_p = 1 + 3*T_p \u2192 T_p - 3*T_p = 1 \u2192 -2*T_p = 1 \u2192 T_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is T(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: when n=1, T(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, T(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, T(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: T(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: T(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, T(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, T(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*T(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, that might be a mistake. Wait, 29524 is actually 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carry over 0. Next digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Thousands place: 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding units: 8 + 4 = 12, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, carry over 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's correct. So, to recap, I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step, then multiplied the outermost result by 3. Each layer involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It's interesting because each step seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that for a moment. If I have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed layer by layer. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Wait, let's see. The innermost parentheses is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Then Layer 2 is a_2, up to Layer 9, which is a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, 3^{10} = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, using the formula gives the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, both by computing layer by layer and by using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find that the outermost expression is 3 times the 9th term, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or something. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula for a geometric series perhaps? Let's see.\n\nThis recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find the general solution, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I got before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me check if the general formula applies correctly.\n\nGiven a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is built upon the previous one with this operation, it's more of a recursively defined sequence rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nAnother approach might be to recognize that each layer is equivalent to (3^{n} - 1)/2, but that seems similar to what I did before. Either way, computing each layer step by step or using the general formula leads to the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the general formula give the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern leading to the final result. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula, we determine the final value of the expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Final Answer**:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, I thought Layer 9 was 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1,093 as Layer 6, but when I computed Layer 6 above, I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29,524 *3 =88,572. So, that seems correct. But let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3\" is a layer, and each additional set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to nine layers, because the expression is 3(1+3(...)) with nine sets of (1+3(...)) inside. So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, 29,524 *3=88,572. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. But wait, I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost part is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, I think my approach is correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. For example, let's compute a simpler version with fewer layers and see if the result matches.\n\nSuppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers inside. Let's compute it step by step.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=1 +12=13.\n\nOutermost layer:3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))) =3(1 +3(1 +3*4))=3(1 +3(1 +12))=3(1 +3*13)=3(1 +39)=3*40=120. Which is correct. Alternatively, 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(1 +12))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. So, the method works for three layers, giving 120. Similarly, if I compute four layers, it should be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))).\n\nInnermost:1 +3=4.\n\nNext:1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40.\n\nOutermost:3*(1 +3*40)=3*(1 +120)=3*121=363.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))=3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3*4)))=3(1 +3(1 +3*(1 +12)))=3(1 +3(1 +3*13))=3(1 +3*40)=3*121=363. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers, so it should work for the larger problem as well. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing Layer 9 again.\n\nLayer 8:9,841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9,841=1 +29,523=29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: Is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? Maybe a geometric series or something? Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we also get 88,572. So, this confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked my arithmetic, and even derived a formula for the nth layer, which gave me the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break down the computation layer by layer:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, wait, 9 is in the thousands place? Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.

Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.

So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...). So, expanding the entire expression, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) etc. But since it's finite, with 9 layers, it's a finite geometric series. Let me see if I can express it that way. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. But in our case, we already have a formula for a_n, which is the value after n layers. So, E = 3*a_9. And a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or express it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Wait, but let me check if I correctly computed each layer because that's a lot of steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer quickly again:\n\nLayer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9.\n\nI notice that each a_n can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2=59049. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, a_9 is 29524, and 3 times that is 88572.\n\nSo, after all that, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it all together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1. 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, carry over 1. 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So, 59048. Then add 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined by that recurrence relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence relation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get to the same answer, which reinforces that 88,572 is correct. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, yeah, that's how I would solve this problem.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe a better approach is to solve the recurrence relation directly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, which is a_9, would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It was a bit involved, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a general formula helped solidify the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I recall that expressions like this, where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, can be modeled as a geometric series or something similar. Let me explore that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me recall the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation. For the recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nIn our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so r=3 and c=1.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1}.\n\nSimplify that:\n\na_n = (1)/(-2) + (a_1 - (1)/(-2)) * 3^{n-1}\n\nWhich is:\n\na_n = -1/2 + (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1}\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, plug that in:\n\na_n = -1/2 + (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} = -1/2 + (9/2) * 3^{n-1}\n\nSimplify further:\n\na_n = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (1/2)*(-1 + 9*3^{n-1})\n\nAlternatively, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = (8)/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation. Good.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (9*3^{2} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, our original expression has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and this happens 9 times. Let me see if I can express this as a sum.\n\nLet me denote S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))... with 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps S can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))... Let me consider how many terms there are.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is of the form a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29524, as computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nEach a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so expanding this, a_n =1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) =1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1? Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because each a_n is defined in terms of a_{n-1}, which itself is a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express a_n as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nGiven that a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1=4=1+3.\n\nSo, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=13.\n\na_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9)=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40.\n\nWait, so each a_n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\na_1=4=1 + 3=1 + 3^1.\n\na_2=13=1 + 3 + 9=1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\na_3=40=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, in general, a_n=1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, but wait, a_1=4=1 + 3= sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k=1 +3=4.\n\na_2=13=1 +3 +9= sum_{k=0}^{2}3^k=13.\n\na_3=40=1 +3 +9 +27= sum_{k=0}^{3}3^k=40.\n\nSo, in general, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n}3^k= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but earlier, using the recurrence, we had a_n=(9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Let me see if these are equivalent.\n\nWait, let's compute (3^{n+1} -1)/2 and (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2.\n\nNote that 9=3^2, so 9*3^{n-1}=3^{2}*3^{n-1}=3^{n+1}. Therefore, (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, both expressions are equivalent. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent across different methods: step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and recognizing the sum as a geometric series.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any computational errors, let me verify the multiplication step again: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me check that:\n\n30000 * 3 = 90000\n\n476 * 3 = 1428\n\nSo, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked my work using different methods, and each time arrived at the same answer. So, I feel good about this solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another term)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, 5 is the next digit, so 5 * 3 is 15, which I wrote down as 5 and carried over 1. Then the next digit is 2 (from 29524), which is the thousands place. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Then, the next digit is 9, which is the ten-thousands place? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to have an error carry through. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nSo, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more complicated. Let me see if there's another way to approach it. Maybe using recursion or recognizing a pattern. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the problem is computing 3*a_9. Let me compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. So, this confirms that a_9 is 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, as each step builds on the previous one correctly. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Wait, no, 3280 is 3000 + 280. So 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, in total, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. So, in my calculation, I correctly went through nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous). Then, after nine layers, I had 29524, and then I multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see. Each layer is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to get the same result, which also confirms it.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Wait, the digits are 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0. Next digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when computing the layers, let me verify each layer step by step again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this kind of expression. Suppose I have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with n layers. Let me denote each layer as L_k, where k goes from 1 to n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_n. So, perhaps I can find a recursive formula here. Let me try to express L_k in terms of L_{k-1}. L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. So, each term is defined recursively. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_k. Let me see. The recurrence relation is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_k^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when k=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, since in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_n, where n=9, so 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, but since I already did it step by step, it's good to cross-verify. I think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing down 8. So putting it all together: 87 (from 2*3+2), then 7 (from 9*3), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try again step by step: 29524 * 3: Units place: 4*3=12. Write 2, carryover 1. Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carryover 0. Hundreds place: 5*3=15.

Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Hundred-thousands digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it from top to bottom, the digits are 8 (from the hundred-thousands place), then 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), and 2 (units). So, the number is 87,572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me verify with a calculator approach. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n+29524\n+29524\n=?\n\nAdding 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\nThen, 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n=88572\n\nAh, so I see where I went wrong earlier. When I multiplied 29524 by 3, I should get 88,572, not 87,572. So, the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3, I should get 88,572. But let me check if my computation of Layer 9 was correct. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that's correct.

Wait, that's 87,752. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572. So there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048\n+29524\n=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the multiplication should be 88,572. Therefore, my previous digit-by-digit multiplication must have been incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me try again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 thousands place: 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 ten-thousands place: 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 hundred-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, that's 87,752. Wait, but that's not matching the addition result. I must have made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, the result should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 units: 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens:7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 hundreds:5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands:8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten-thousands:8.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,572. Oh! I see where I went wrong earlier. I think I misplaced the digits when writing them down. So, the correct multiplication is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just verify once more to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial digit-by-digit multiplication by misaligning the digits. So, the correct result is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Maybe by breaking it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the answer would be 88572. But I'm not sure if I made a mistake in the layers. Let me check each layer again to be thorough.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, the problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, we have 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this kind of expression.\n\nSuppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using this recursive formula. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the problem is indeed 3*(a_9). Yes, because the expression starts with 3*(...), and the innermost is a_1, so the outermost is a_9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding the entire expression. But that seems tedious, given the nine layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric series.\n\nWait, each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is correct, as it's the sum of a geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers can be seen as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k), but wait, no, that's not quite accurate because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recursive approach and the formula I've already derived. Since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2, which is (3^{11} -3)/2, which equals 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, perhaps I should consider that 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's consider each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or the computations. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this kind of recursive relation.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go through the problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(...)\", so let's see:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet's count the number of \"1+3(...)\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside, another 1+3(...)\n3. Continuing, each time, so how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression, each time you open a parenthesis, you have 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the outermost, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the first layer is 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 1. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 2, and so on until the innermost Layer 9, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, so actually, in the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1, then each layer wraps around that. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" starts a new layer, so starting from the first one after the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside, 1+3(...)\n3. Then another 1+3(...)\n4. Then another 1+3(...)\n5. Then another 1+3(...)\n6. Then another 1+3(...)\n7. Then another 1+3(...)\n8. Then another 1+3(...)\n9. Then another 1+3(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, each starting with \"1+3(\", so Layer 1 to Layer 9. Thus, the innermost is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around that. Wait, no, that seems conflicting with my earlier approach. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is actually Layer 1, and each subsequent layer is built outward. So, if I have 9 layers, then the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, when I computed Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), and inside that, the first layer is 1 + 3*(...), so that's Layer 1. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, that's the innermost. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is the next layer out, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I've done it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more of a linear recurrence.\n\nBut since I've already solved it using the recurrence relation and confirmed with the formula, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time, perhaps using the formula for each layer.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived earlier, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check my multiplication again, because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a recurrence relation, and checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen, (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is (1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So yes, starting from 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1 + 3*(...). So I think I did nine layers correctly, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about it.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which can be solved using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nThe solution to a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} with a_1 = c + r*a_0 (where a_0 = 0 if we start from n=1) is:\n\na_n = (c*(r^{n} - 1))/(r - 1)\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3. So the formula would be:\n\na_n = (1*(3^{n} - 1))/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I plug in n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1, which is not 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the formula. Let me think again. The standard form for a linear recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is indeed a geometric progression. Let me try to compute the first few terms to see the pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the terms are 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe standard solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (C*3^{n} + D), where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_p = D, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 \u21d2 D = 3D + 1 \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_9, since we start from a_1 as the innermost parentheses. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So that's a good consistency check.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Since the original problem is 3*(a_9), which is 3*29524.\n\nAs I computed earlier, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 59049 \u00d7 3 = 177147\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThat's another way to compute it, which gives the same result.\n\nSo, in summary, by either computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer of 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step to ensure each layer was computed correctly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Hmm, that seems right, but let me verify the multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a repeated multiplication and addition, which might relate to a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*previous. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find B. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n = 0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1 + 3*a_{-1}, but maybe it's better to solve the recurrence relation properly. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(n\\) is the layer number.

    "text": " Wait, 9 is the next digit? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: 4 * 3 = 12, as before. Then, 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Then, 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry 1. Then, 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry 2. Then, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers, right? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1) =1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way, even though it's time-consuming. Alternatively, I could look for a pattern in the results of each layer to see if there's a formula that can compute the nth layer without computing each step. Let's see: Looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer 3:40\n\nLayer 4:121\n\nLayer 5:364\n\nLayer 6:1093\n\nLayer 7:3280\n\nLayer 8:9841\n\nLayer 9:29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, is there a pattern or a recurrence relation? Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, each layer n = 1 + 3*(layer n-1). That's the recurrence relation.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its closed-form solution can be found. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\n=> K - 3K = 1\n\n=> -2K = 1\n\n=> K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n=> 4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n=> 9/2 = 3C\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Hmm, wait, 5 is in the hundreds place, so the next digit is 5, then 2, then 9, then 2. Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step isn't too bad. However, if this were a much longer expression, recognizing a geometric series or some other pattern might be more efficient. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent.

Wait, but let me just go back and make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent layers will be wrong. Let's go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, maybe a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the step-by-step process is: 1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. 3. After computing the innermost nine layers, multiply the final result by 3 to get the total. 4. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to compute the result more efficiently. 5. Both methods lead to the same result, confirming that the answer is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Hmm, wait, 5 is in the hundreds place, so next is 5, then 9? Wait, maybe I should write it down properly. Let's write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n- Next digit (2) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n- Next digit (5) * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n- Next digit (9) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n- Next digit (2) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I thought that Layer 9 was 29524, so multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. So, is that the final answer? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let's go back step by step through the layers to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, when you have a nested expression like this, you can find a pattern or a formula. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the solution is a_n = r^n * a_0 + s*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, r=3 and s=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * a_0 + (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 is 4, so maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me think. Let me define a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the formula for such a recurrence: a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because the initial condition is at n=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute it step by step as I did before, since the number of layers isn't too large.\n\nWait, but if I use the formula, let me see if it works. Let's try n=1: a_1=4.\n\nIf I plug into the formula: a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But since a_1=4, I can solve for a_0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the formula. Let me consider the general solution for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply initial condition: at n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this works for n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Let me just verify the multiplication once more: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows:\n\n29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I double-checked each layer, used the recurrence relation formula to confirm the result, and even verified the multiplication in two different ways. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. We compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, no carryover.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So adding those: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, 58000 + 1000 = 59000, 59000 + 40 = 59040, 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 20 = 88568, 88568 + 4 = 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step by step seems manageable. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the layers. Let's list the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. For example:\n\nLayer 2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\nAnd so on. So, each layer n is equal to 3*(layer n-1) + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for layer n, which would make computing large numbers easier. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula. In this case, k=3, c=1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, yes, the layer 9 is 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. From the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, which would be the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, so in my earlier computation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. That seems right. But let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, there's a new \"1 + 3(\" except for the innermost which is just \"1 + 3\". So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, yes, there are nine layers, each time adding another 3*(...). Therefore, my earlier computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nSo, each a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation. Perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na\u2081 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a\u2085 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a\u2086 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a\u2087=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a\u2088=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a\u2089=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a\u2089=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and applied the formula without computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers was manageable (only nine), computing each layer step by step was feasible.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( a_1 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( a_4 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( a_5 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( a_6 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( a_7 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( a_8 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( a_9 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, 9 is the next digit, so 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carryover 1 makes 28. So write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So putting it all together, we have 8 (from the 2*3 +2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). So that would be 88,572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check once more because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a calculation error. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time there's a \"1+3(\", so let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)), so each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count them: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is the first. Then each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count how many \"1 + 3(\" there are. From the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3( ... ). So:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Let me see. The original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" inside. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo the first layer is 1 + 3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. The first \"1 + 3(\" is inside the first 3(...), so that's layer 1.\n2. The next \"1 + 3(\" is inside that, so layer 2.\n3. Continuing this way, each time we have a new \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nSo how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is just 1 + 3, so that's the base case, layer 1.\n- Then each time we go out, we have another \"1 + 3(\", so layer 2, layer 3, up to layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each time we add another layer, so the number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Let me confirm by writing them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nSo yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier computation up to Layer 9 is correct, leading to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and I've double-checked each layer. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating the expression inside out. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
