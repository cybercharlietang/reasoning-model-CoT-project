    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for L_n in terms of n. Let me write down the first few terms: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the values are growing quite rapidly, which makes sense because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Now, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to look at it, which also gives the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me just double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's exponential growth, so it's plausible.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step might be the most straightforward way, even if it's a bit tedious.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if the method works. For example, if the expression was just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it works for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I think my step-by-step computation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3.

Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me try computing a few layers again to make sure I didn't skip any or make a multiplication error. Let me recompute Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's try to find a general formula for a_n. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. First, find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to express this in terms of exponents, I could say that the total expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. That's a good way to verify. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or express it in terms of exponents, I arrive at the same answer. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result for this expression.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Maybe by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me just check each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes earlier on. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, another thought: this structure resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant solution a_n^{part} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Using the formula I found, each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nWait, so is there a way to see this as a geometric series? Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let's denote the innermost expression as x. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me write the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s and 1s. It seems like each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. But perhaps expanding it would show a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and we have 9 layers, the formula we derived earlier is applicable.\n\nWait, another thought: if I have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. So, the final result is (3^{11} -3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum: Let me try to expand it. Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can express this recursively. Let me think of E as 3*(1 + 3*E'), where E' is the expression with one fewer layer. But wait, in this case, each time we go one layer out, we're adding another 3*(...). But maybe this approach is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. So, the sum S = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n, but in this case, it's more about the recurrence relation.\n\nBut I think the approach I took earlier, computing each layer step by step, is straightforward and manageable. It's easy to make an arithmetic mistake, so double-checking each step is important. Let me verify the computations again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, all these steps check out. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 +12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each of the nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost expression.\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Use the result from Layer 1.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Use the result from Layer 2.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Use the result from Layer 3.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Use the result from Layer 4.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Use the result from Layer 5.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Use the result from Layer 6.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Use the result from Layer 7.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Use the result from Layer 8.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did 29524 * 3, I think I might have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73. 29000\u00d73 = 87000. 524\u00d73: 500\u00d73=1500, 24\u00d73=72. So, 1500 + 72 = 1572. Adding 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check if I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire result. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...), which resembles a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form solution, confirming the result through both iterative computation and formula application.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This structure repeats nine times, with each layer building on the previous one.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved to find a closed-form formula:\n   - a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n   - For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n   - Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the way the expression is nested, it's actually a recurrence relation. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if a pattern emerges: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, after 9 layers, we get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in this recurrence. Let me try to derive it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, same as before. So, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to confirm. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems correct. Let me check a couple of layers to be sure. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.

Yes, that matches. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one is manageable. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3\u00d7L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A\u00d73^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We know that L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, and so on. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3\u00d7L_{n-1}. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3\u00d7L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3\u00d7L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when L_n = 3\u00d7L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^h = C\u00d73^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3\u00d7L_p + 1 \u2192 L_p - 3\u00d7L_p = 1 \u2192 -2\u00d7L_p = 1 \u2192 L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C\u00d73^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L_1 = 4 = C\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I could have computed it directly without going through each layer. But since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same result, I feel confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, that seems reasonable.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, is that the final answer?\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen 1+3(1+3)\n\nThen 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" after the first 3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen 1+3(Layer1) is Layer 2.\n\nThen 1+3(Layer2) is Layer3.\n\nContinuing until Layer9. So, that's 9 layers. So, I think I did compute up to Layer9 correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Maybe I can test with a smaller version of the problem to verify my method.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute using my layer method:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for this smaller example, giving the correct result of 120.\n\nAnother test: Let's take 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, my approach seems valid. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, I think I did it correctly.\n\nWait, but let me check my computation for Layer9 again. 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let me compute that again.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 * 3 = 3.\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25. Write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29. Write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number: 9,8,4,1.\n\nWait, 9841 * 3:\n\nFirst digit (units place): 1*3=3.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 4*3=12. So, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 8*3=24 +1=25. Write 5, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9*3=27 +2=29. Write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 before the thousands place. So, the result is 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Layer9 was 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the nested structure, the step-by-step approach seems more straightforward.\n\nWait, another thought: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, but the step-by-step computation and the general formula both lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a recurrence relation, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Compute Layer 2:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Compute Layer 3:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Compute Layer 4:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Compute Layer 5:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Compute Layer 6:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Compute Layer 7:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Compute Layer 8:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Compute Layer 9:**\n   - 1 + 3 * 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Layer:**\n    - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, so write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, then a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more formally. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to confirm.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the pattern of a geometric series. Let me consider the general form: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the nth term. But in this case, each layer is built from the previous one, so it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = (3*59048)/2. Compute 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That matches the earlier result. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and using the recurrence relation confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and using both iterative computation and a recurrence relation approach, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. I wonder if there's a geometric series or something here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm by another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo yes, 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). So if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might miscount the layers, especially if you're not writing them down. Let me count the number of layers again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n10. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So that's correct. So Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost inside, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9. So yes, 3*29524 is 88,572. Let me just make sure that when I computed 3*29524, I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute it again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here because each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nPlug into the equation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2, a_2 should be 13.\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer inside the initial 3*(...), we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. **Final Step**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2. Carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, 7. 5*3=15, 5. Carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8. Carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and compute each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe this sequence follows a pattern similar to a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the final answer is 88572. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's denote the innermost expression as a variable to see if we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute each term as follows:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nSo, the 9th term is 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. That's the same result as before, so it's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the 9th term is indeed 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a few layers using the formula to see if it's consistent.\n\nFor example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work multiple times, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Let me verify each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nWe have:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nLet\u2019s consider solving this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find a particular solution, we can assume a constant solution Ln^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nWe can determine the constant C using the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, plugging n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\nLn = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nLn = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, but given that each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more straightforward to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each time you go a layer out, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is exactly what the recurrence is. So, the formula I derived earlier is applicable here.\n\nLet me check if there's a different approach, maybe expanding the entire expression step by step, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can compute the value using the formula I have.\n\nGiven that L9 = 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTo ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. The final step involves multiplying the outermost layer by 3, resulting in the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis kind of recursive relation can sometimes be solved using the formula for a geometric series or by finding a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did initially, but using the formula makes it faster and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors, especially since there are nine layers.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, checking each result as I go.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation, which confirms the step-by-step results.\n\n4. Multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods (step-by-step computation and using the formula) give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it another way. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Compute each part: 20000 * 3 = 60000. 9000 * 3 = 27000. 500 * 3 = 1500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's the same as before. So, the multiplication checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*c^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = c*K + d => K - c*K = d => K*(1 - c) = d => K = d/(1 - c). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*c^n + d/(1 - c). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4, let's compute A. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is the first term after the innermost parentheses. Wait, let me clarify: If we consider the innermost layer as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what we computed earlier. So, using the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, in terms of the formula, c = 3, d = 1. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, which is similar to a geometric series. But since we've already solved it step by step and also using the recurrence relation, I think we're good. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Identify the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, up to nine layers. 3. After computing the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 4. As a check, model the problem using a recurrence relation and derive a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which confirmed the step-by-step computation. 5. Finally, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. All steps led to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n- Layer 4: 121\n- Layer 5: 364\n- Layer 6: 1093\n- Layer 7: 3280\n- Layer 8: 9841\n- Layer 9: 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the ninth layer by 3 gives the result:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier in computing the layers.

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, that's nine layers. So, the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches a_2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, a_3=40.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, found a closed-form formula, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: \n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88,572. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572. I think that's the correct solution. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me cross-verify the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, yes, I computed nine layers, and then multiplied by 3. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I computed Layer 9, I did 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Let me verify that: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nBut I'm a bit concerned because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Maybe there's a geometric series or something like that. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nFirst, let's write down the first few terms:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed with a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form solution, confirming that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, the entire expression would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2=1 +3*a1=1 +12=13. a3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40. a4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121. a5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364. a6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093. a7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280. a8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841. a9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524. So, each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2 =3A => 9/2 =3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when I compute each layer, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that, let's check with our earlier computations:\n\nLayer 1: n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: n=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer.\n\nBut since I initially computed each layer step by step and got the same result, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, substituting the result of the inner layer into the outer one.\n\n3. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and solve it to find a general formula, then plug in the required layer.\n\nBoth methods led to the same final result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this pattern, we can compute each layer step by step or use a recurrence relation to find the solution.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's compute 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted or made an error in computation. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting with a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to see if I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. If I expand this, it's similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))). Wait, but actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, and each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, maybe the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))) with nine layers. But I think the approach I took earlier is sufficient. So, to recap: Starting from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step, recognizing the pattern, and then using the closed-form formula to find the value at each layer. Then, multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result. Therefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Now, add 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.

Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9.

Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, each step seems correct.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 500 = 88548\n\n88548 + 24 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go back step by step through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, that should be the final answer. But wait, I just want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count them: 1. ( after 3\n2. ( after 1+3\n3. ( after 1+3\n4. ( after 1+3\n5. ( after 1+3\n6. ( after 1+3\n7. ( after 1+3\n8. ( after 1+3\n9. ( after 1+3\n10. ( after 1+3\n\nWait, hold on, that's 10 layers, not 9. Did I miscount earlier? Let me check again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3). Then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's parse the expression:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, the next is 1+3*(Layer1), which is Layer 2.\n- Then, 1+3*(Layer2) is Layer3.\n- Continuing this way, each additional ( adds a new layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: (, (, (, (, (, (, (, (, (.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, my initial count was correct: 9 layers. So, the outermost is Layer9, which is 1+3*(Layer8). So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that was correct, and then I multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't have an off-by-one error in the layers. Let me recount the layers as per the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, yes, 9 layers, meaning Layer9 is the outermost one, which I computed as 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer9 again step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This recurrence relation can be solved, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But wait, our Layer1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, perhaps the formula is slightly different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, Layer9 corresponds to n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but perhaps it's overcomplicating for this problem since there are only nine layers. However, it might be useful to know for similar problems in the future. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3.
