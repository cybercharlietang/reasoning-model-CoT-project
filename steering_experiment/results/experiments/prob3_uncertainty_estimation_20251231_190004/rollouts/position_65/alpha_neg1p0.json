    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15.

Wait, but 29524 is 29,524, right? So 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units: 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens: 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15.

So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without assigning layers, just to see if I get the same result. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I got earlier. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I also arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me compute the expression another way. Maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Wait, a geometric series is a sum where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a recursive geometric series. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 40, and so on up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. We have a_1 = 4. Plugging into the formula: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A = 3/2 into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count: Starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2: 1+3*(layer1), up to layer9: 1+3*(layer8). So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, we can write L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify one of the layers to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct. Then, 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if there were more layers. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and confirm with the formula, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the inside out. 2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each multiplication and addition is correct. 3. After computing up to the outermost layer, multiply by 3 as per the original expression. 4. Alternatively, derive a formula based on the recurrence relation to compute the outermost layer directly. 5. Verify the formula with known values and use it to find the result. 6. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 7. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy, especially since arithmetic errors can easily occur with multiple steps. I think I've covered all the necessary steps and verified the computations sufficiently. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression.

Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, this is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think. If each layer is 1 + 3n, then each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an additive constant each time. Wait, actually, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, I can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Wait, that's 88,572, but earlier I calculated 87,572. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in one of the methods? Let me check. When I computed each layer step by step, I ended up with a_9 =29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 87572. But using the formula, I got 88572. There's a difference of 1000. So, clearly, I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine my step-by-step computation. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=87572. So that's correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWait, so which one is correct? There's a conflict here. Let me check my formula again.\n\nI derived the formula as a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in the problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut when I computed step by step, I got 87572.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Let me check the step-by-step computation again, perhaps I made an error in one of the layers.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 88572.\n\nHmm, so there's a discrepancy of 1000. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, but the innermost is 1+3, which is layer1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3: layer1\n\nThen, 1+3(layer1): layer2\n\nThen, 1+3(layer2): layer3\n\nContinuing until the outermost layer, which is layer9.\n\nSo, 9 layers in total.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation. So, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, 3*a_9= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nWait, so the formula suggests that 3*a_9=88572, but step-by-step gives 87572.\n\nTherefore, one of them must be wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again.\n\nI had a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nBut in the problem, the expression is 3*(a_9). So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11}=177147, so 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nBut step-by-step gives 87572.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my formula is incorrect because I misapplied the recurrence.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence is a_n=1+3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nUsing the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nLet me compute a_1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\na_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3=(3^4-1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4=(3^5-1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_5=(3^6-1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6=(3^7-1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7=(3^8-1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8=(3^9-1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9=29524. Then, 3*a_9=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, 3*a_9= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nWait, so where is the mistake? Because 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11}=177147, so 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nBut step-by-step computation gives 87572.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the computations.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, it should be 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, the formula is for a_n, which is the value inside the nth layer, which is multiplied by 3 in the outermost expression.\n\nWait, but the formula gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, if I compute 3*a_9, it's 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think.\n\nWait, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 is derived from the recurrence a_n=1+3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, 3*a_9= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me rederive the formula.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n=1+3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nHomogeneous equation: a_n -3a_{n-1}=0.\n\nCharacteristic equation: r -3=0 => r=3.\n\nSo, homogeneous solution: A*3^n.\n\nParticular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C=1+3C => C-3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, general solution: a_n=A*3^n -1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -0.5 => 3A=4.5 => A=1.5=3/2.\n\nThus, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, 3*a_9= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nWait, but 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11}=177147, so (177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut step-by-step, I get 3*29524=87572.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, so 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, 3*a_9= (3^{11}-3)/2= (177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the outermost expression is 3*a_9, whereas the formula a_n is for the inner expressions.\n\nWait, but no, the formula correctly gives a_9=29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 87572.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct, but when I compute 3*a_9=87572, while the formula for 3*a_9 is (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=87572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the entire expression is (3^{n+2}-3)/2, where n is the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIf n=1, the expression is 3*(1+3)=3*4=12.\n\nUsing the formula (3^{1+2}-3)/2=(27-3)/2=24/2=12. Correct.\n\nn=2: 3*(1+3*(1+3))=3*(1+12)=3*13=39.\n\nFormula: (3^{4}-3)/2=(81-3)/2=78/2=39. Correct.\n\nn=3: 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))=3*(1+3*4)=3*13=39?

Correct.\n\nSo, for n=3, the formula gives 120, which matches the step-by-step.\n\nSimilarly, for n=9, the formula would give (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nBut when I compute step-by-step, I get 87572.\n\nTherefore, the formula must be correct, and I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step computation again.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 88572.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.

So, the result is 87572. Therefore, the final answer should be 87572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. As I did before, that's 87572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), which leads to c = 3c, implying c=0, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer would be n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 87572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer step by step. The final value of the outermost layer is 29524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the result 87572.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, yes, 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3 is 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3: Break it down as (30,000 - 48) * 3 = 90,000 - 144 = 89,856. Wait, that's different. Hmm, now I'm confused.

But when I did the alternative method: 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For Layer 1 (n=1): (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Layer 4 (n=4): (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5 (n=5): (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6 (n=6): (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7 (n=7): (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8 (n=8): (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9 (n=9): (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 as per the original expression. So, 3 * 29524 =88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88,572. Same result. So, that confirms the answer is correct. I think I've got it. So, the key was to recognize the pattern, compute each layer step by step, and then use the formula to verify the result. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, but let me confirm that I did the layers correctly because 88572 seems quite large, and maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which is much faster and reduces the chance of error.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentials, let me verify 3^10 again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have tried expanding each layer step by step, which worked too, but it's more time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By recognizing this as a recursive sequence, we can derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Solve the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **General Solution**: The solution to the recurrence is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: Substitute \\( n = 9 \\) into the formula to get \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\), so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 87572. So, 29524 * 3 = 87572. Therefore, the final result is 87572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula because each layer is similar. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without doing each layer step by step, just to verify. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to the form of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Let me think about it. If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, maybe I should derive it. Let's consider the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572 \u2714\ufe0f So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 87572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000 + 9000 = 29000, +500=29500, +20=29520, +4=29524. So, 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous result. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 87572. There's a discrepancy here. Wait, which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88572. Wait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 87572. Let me check my previous calculation. I think I messed up the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 87572, but actually, it's 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Therefore, the correct final answer is 88572, not 87572. That's a crucial error. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, going back, Layer 9 is 29524, then 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because when I broke down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, multiplying each by 3 gives 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12, which adds up to 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nEarlier, when I thought it was 87572, I must have miscalculated the addition somewhere. So, I need to correct that.\n\nTherefore, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was to compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and found Layer 9 to be 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the recurrence relation, I confirmed that Layer 9 is indeed 29524, so 3 times that is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire expression, which is up to Layer 9. So, the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, as Layer 1 is 4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as Layer 2 is 13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the formula applies correctly here. Since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire original expression as a single formula. Let's see.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, if each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nYes, that confirms the result again.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, that's correct. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer of 88,572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me test it. For n=1: L_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but wait, L_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = 2*3^{n} -1. Let's test that. For n=1: 2*3^1 -1=6-1=5, but L_1 is 4. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, maybe L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's try n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches L_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=121, which matches L_4=121. Okay, so the formula seems to be L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11}=177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. That confirms the result again.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that could be expressed recursively. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me consider that. The recursive formula here is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. However, for the sake of understanding, let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4})/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've thought this through thoroughly, double-checked each step, and even found a formula to confirm the result. So, I feel confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let's write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 7, 5, 7, 2. So the result is 87572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation. Let me try again. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's 88572. So my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I didn't align the digits properly. So the correct answer after multiplying 29524 by 3 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in any of these steps. Let me recompute Layer 9 again: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute it as 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo writing it out: 8 (from 2\u00d73+2), 8 (from 9\u00d73+1), 5 (from 5\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73+1), 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but earlier when I did the other method, I got 88572 as well. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in my earlier alternative method. Let me recalculate 29524 \u00d7 3 using another approach. 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. So my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was correct, and the alternative method also confirms it. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had a discrepancy, but now I see that both methods give me 88572. So maybe I was confused earlier, but now I'm confident that 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Use that result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. Continue this process, each time using the result from the previous layer to compute the next one.\n\n4. After computing up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, multiply that by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems to cover all the steps without any errors. So I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since we only have nine terms, computing each step manually is feasible, which I did earlier. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, we have nine layers, but starting from a_1 = 4, which is layer 1, up to layer 9. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, using the formula, we get the same result, which confirms that our manual computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolve for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1=4, and after 9 layers, it's a_9, then multiplied by 3.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, recognizing that each step is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with an added 1 each time.\n\nWait, but in the recurrence relation, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a geometric series with a twist. The sum can be calculated using the formula for such a series.\n\nBut since I've already solved it using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation, and both give me the same result, I think I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and realize that each layer depends on the previous one.\n\n2. Start computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n3. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each calculation as I went along.\n\n4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n5. As a sanity check, model the problem using a recurrence relation, solve it, and confirm that the result matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nThis multi-step approach helps ensure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way, especially since the numbers get large quickly. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate when dealing with multiple layers, so having two different methods leading to the same answer is reassuring.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps and verified the solution thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed using the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting from the innermost layer and moving outward. After computing all layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the next nested term. There are 9 layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 88572. Let me verify that by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nWait, but hold on, in my initial computation, I thought each layer was being computed correctly. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but I just thought, does the expression have 9 layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3(, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers, each starting with 3(1+3(...). So, each layer is as I computed: Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, my computation seems correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication step because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That confirms it.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't skip any or make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or have a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying each step and even deriving a general formula for the layers, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\). Each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times \\) the result of Layer 9:\n   - Final computation: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Wait, so I think I made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me do it again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So that must be correct. So the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and maybe I messed up somewhere in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would allow me to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term. Let's see. The recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute this without calculating each layer, I could use the closed-form formula and then multiply by 3. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors when multiplying 29524 by 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). There's one at the very end: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the initial step. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might allow me to compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer. Let me think about this. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula. That's much quicker, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, to recap: Each layer n contributes a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. The outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Multiply that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, hold on, when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I might have made an error in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 87572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 87572. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \nCalculate each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing it together: 87572.\n\nBut when I did it as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in that alternative method.\n\nWait, 29524 is 29,524. So 30,000 - 476 is indeed 29,524. So 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000. 476 \u00d7 3 = 1,428. So 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. These two results don't match, which means I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nLet me try adding 29,524 three times to see which one is correct.\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048.\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo that's 3 times 29,524 equals 88,572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong earlier. Let me check where I messed up.\n\nWait, when I did the digit-by-digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572.

Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n    2 9 5 2 4  \n\u00d7          3  \n____________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572. But when I add 29,524 three times, I get 88,572. There's a 1,000 difference here. So clearly, one of the methods is wrong. Let me check the addition method again.\n\n29,524 + 29,524: Let's compute this step by step.\n\n29,524  \n+29,524  \n________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8.\n\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo the sum is 59,048.\n\nNow, adding the third 29,524:\n\n59,048  \n+29,524  \n________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Therefore, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing down the result. Let me try the multiplication again carefully:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \nMultiply each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572. But according to the addition, it's 88,572. Hmm, this is confusing. There must be a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me check the addition again.\n\n29,524 + 29,524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8.\n\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write 9, carry 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 59,048. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 59,048 + 29,524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, so why is the multiplication giving me 87,572? Maybe I messed up the digit positions.\n\nWait, let me write it out vertically:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4  \n    \u00d7      3  \n    __________  \n      ? ? ? ? ?  \n\nSo, starting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572. But according to addition, it's 88,572. There's a 1,000 difference. So I must have made a mistake in either the multiplication or the addition.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits in the multiplication. Let me check the number of digits.\n\n29,524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying by 3, the result should also be a 5 or 6-digit number. Since 29,524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572, which is a 5-digit number, so 87,572 is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication process. Let me try again:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7      3  \n________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572. But according to the addition, it's 88,572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me try writing it out with proper alignment.\n\n      2 9 5 2 4  \n    \u00d7      3  \n    __________  \n      8 7 5 7 2  \n\nWait, but 29,524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572, so this can't be right. Let me check each digit again:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo the result is 87,572. But when I add 29,524 three times, I get 88,572. Therefore, my multiplication must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition.\n\nWait, let me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 using another method: breaking it down.\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo that confirms that 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, my earlier digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. I must have miscounted the digits or made a mistake in the process. It's clear that 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, going back, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to ensure that all the previous steps were correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Therefore, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572, which is wrong. So I must have miscounted the digits or made a mistake in the multiplication process. It's clear that the correct result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try multiplying 29,524 by 3 using another method: using the standard algorithm properly.\n\n      2 9 5 2 4  \n    \u00d7      3  \n    __________  \nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 87,572. Wait, but this contradicts the addition method which gave 88,572.\n\nThis is confusing. There must be a mistake in either the addition or the multiplication. Let me use a calculator to verify.\n\nWait, I don't have a calculator here, but I can compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's 88,572. Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. So, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I must have miscounted the digits or made a mistake in the process. It's clear that 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I got 87,572, but now I'm seeing that it's 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit positions when writing down the result. It's easy to miscount the digits when doing multiplication manually, especially with larger numbers.\n\nSo, to avoid confusion, I'll stick with the breakdown method which clearly shows that 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer correctly and multiplying the final layer by 3, the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost expression, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. Finally, the result of the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses.\n   - \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Use the result from Layer 1.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Use the result from Layer 2.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Use the result from Layer 3.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Use the result from Layer 4.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Use the result from Layer 5.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Use the result from Layer 6.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Use the result from Layer 7.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Use the result from Layer 8.\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n    - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me confirm each step because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer computation to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As computed earlier, that's 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to cross-verify. I remember that expressions like this, which have a repeated structure, can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the problem is asking for 3*a_9. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve it using homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, expanding the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to the expansion of a geometric series. But in this case, since it's finite (nine layers), we can use the formula we derived earlier. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and then using a general formula to confirm, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as L_n where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to find a pattern. Let me compute a few more terms beyond what I did earlier to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nWait, actually, I already have up to L_9, but maybe I can find a general formula. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is L_9, so:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's correct.

Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute this without expanding each layer, I could have used the formula directly. But since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, if I consider the innermost term, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous).\n\nBut since we have a fixed number of layers (9), it's more straightforward to compute each one step by step or use the recursive formula.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, here's the step-by-step computation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. I don't see any errors in the calculations, so I think 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\). Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding the units: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. Hundreds: 0 + 5 = 5. Thousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1. Ten-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121. So, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 is 88572. So, all the layers seem correct.

But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original problem is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric progression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each layer without manually expanding each time, which is more efficient, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building a geometric series. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, each term is 1 + 3*(...). If I expand this, it's similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but I'm not sure if that's exactly the case here. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, when you have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), each layer adds another power of 3. So, in the end, the value of each layer is the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and as we saw, it can be expressed as L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(...), and each inner part is similar, maybe I can model it as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nBut perhaps that's complicating it more than necessary. Since we've already got the solution using both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method, and both give the same result, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Compute each layer from the inside out, starting with 1 + 3 and working up to the outermost layer, which gives L_9 = 29524.\n- Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number. The recurrence relation for each layer is:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1} \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- Layer 1: \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe outermost layer is \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). We then multiply this result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n800*3=2400\n40*3=120\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let's see.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, if each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. Just recognizing the pattern as a geometric series.\n\nBut since the problem is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier. It's good to verify the answer using both methods to ensure it's correct.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each nested layer from the inside out, I arrived at the final result of 88572. I also verified this using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gave the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer step by step. The expression is a nested set where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\). Using this, we compute up to the ninth layer, which gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

So Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check this another way. Perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a type of recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A \u00d7 3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C\u00d73^{n}, where C is a constant. Then, we can find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say, a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C\u00d73^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C\u00d73^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3^{10} another way. 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243\u00d7243:\n\n243 \u00d7 243:\n\nCompute 243 \u00d7 200 = 48,600\n\n243 \u00d7 40 = 9,720\n\n243 \u00d7 3 = 729\n\nAdd them together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049.\n\nYes, so 3^{10}=59,049. Therefore, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524.\n\nSo, 3\u00d729,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me do that multiplication again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d73=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 as (30,000 - 476) \u00d73 = 30,000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that also works.\n\nSo, all the steps check out, and the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking down the nested expressions from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

So, putting it all together, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, I can compute it directly without computing each layer. That might be faster, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad. But knowing the general formula is useful for future problems. So, in summary, the problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, I computed each layer step by step, which led me to the result. Additionally, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to derive a general formula, which confirmed the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each step was computed carefully, and the multiplication was double-checked. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together, we have 87572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from the digit-by-digit approach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit. Let's check again. 29524: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, but when I added 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12, I got 88572. So that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n corresponds to Layer n. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
