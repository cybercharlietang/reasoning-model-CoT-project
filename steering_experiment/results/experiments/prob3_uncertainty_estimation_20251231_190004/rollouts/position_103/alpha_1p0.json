    "text": " Let's compute a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Substituting the assumed solution: (A*3^n + B) - 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1. Simplify: A*3^n + B - 3*A*3^{n-1} - 3B = 1. 3*A*3^{n-1} + B - 3*A*3^{n-1} - 3B = 1. The 3*A*3^{n-1} terms cancel out, leaving B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer.

When n=1, a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost one? Wait, no. Wait, in the expression, the innermost layer is layer 1, which corresponds to n=1. Then each subsequent layer is n=2, up to n=9, which is the outermost one. Wait, but in the expression, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the 9th layer. So using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. Each step follows logically, and both the iterative method and the formula method give the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we have a term that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). As I did before, but perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms. Wait, actually, the number of layers is 9, starting from 1 + 3 up to the 9th layer. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, but let me see. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series: S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, n is the number of terms. But in this case, each term is being added after being multiplied by 3, so it's a bit different. Wait, actually, the expression can be represented as a sum: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, but actually, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but in a nested way. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think. If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost: Let's say E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) Then E = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) = 3 + 9*(E'), where E' is the next layer. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since we already have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we have n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. So, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with the recurrence relation, and confirming with the closed-form formula, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

But according to the recurrence, a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Therefore, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, 0 + (-2B) = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, since a_1 = 4, we can plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4.

Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I think about this as a geometric series, each term is 3 times the previous one plus 1. But given that it's a linear recurrence, the closed-form is more straightforward. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute each layer.
