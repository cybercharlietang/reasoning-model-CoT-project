Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each term also adds 1, it's a bit more complex. However, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives a neat formula, which is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, after verifying through both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication step because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me check that:\n\n30000 * 3 = 90000\n476 * 3 = 1428\nSo, 90000 - 1428 = 88572.

But actually, the number of layers is 9, so perhaps it's similar to a geometric series with 9 terms. Wait, but each term is multiplied by 3, so the expansion would be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but that's not exactly the case here because each term is 1 + 3*(...), so it's more like each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So it's not a simple geometric series. Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Hmm, perhaps the formula we found earlier is more straightforward.

Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Therefore, equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which is fine. For constants: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9 for the innermost, but wait, let me check. Wait, actually, in our earlier computation, we started with Layer 1 as the innermost, which was 1+3=4, which corresponds to a_1=4. Then Layer 2 was a_2=13, which would be n=2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, for Layer 9, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I would have had to compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier, which is more time-consuming but works just as well. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, (177144)/2 = 88572. So that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, but in this case, computing each step was straightforward and manageable since there are only nine layers. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3, I arrived at the answer 88572. It's also interesting to see that using the recurrence relation approach confirmed the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Now, set equal to left side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.

Therefore, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. This method using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Either way, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us a closed-form expression, which when evaluated for 9 layers, results in the final value of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.
