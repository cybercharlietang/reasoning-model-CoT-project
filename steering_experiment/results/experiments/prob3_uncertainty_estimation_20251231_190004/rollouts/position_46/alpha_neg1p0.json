So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again: 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but when I compute 29524 *3, is it 88572? Let me verify with another method. 29524 *3: Let's break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 +1500 +60 +12 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of them. Starting with Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems to check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 +3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a1, a3=1+3a2, etc., up to a9. So, the general formula is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K=1 +3K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2 =3C => 9/2=3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, maybe I should do it digit by digit without carrying over, but actually, that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do that:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nSo, let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, yes, the product is 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me verify if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that could represent this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here. In this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution, L_n^p. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works! So, using this formula, I can compute L_9 directly without calculating each layer step by step, which would be especially useful if there were more layers.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this relation, we derive a formula to compute the outermost layer directly, leading to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Recognizing the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 3L_{n-1} + 1\\), we find the solution \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we determine the value of each layer and multiply the outermost layer by 3 to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 27, 8, 8, 7, 2. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me do it properly step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12.

Write down 8.\n9 (the next digit) * 3 = 27. Write down 27.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nSo, multiplying each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, right? Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo the digits are 2,7,5,8,8, but that's 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me confirm with another method: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step from the inside out, ensuring each layer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, given the repetitive structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nI notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but wait, actually, the standard solution is:\n\nFor L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*( (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) )\n\nWait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so perhaps L_n = 3^{n} * C + (1)/(1 - 3) ?\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C * 3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution, assuming a constant, would be L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern. By breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each step systematically. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form solution, confirming the result through both iterative computation and formulaic approach. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again because it's easy to make an arithmetic error there.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad either way. However, knowing the formula is useful for future problems. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I found that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the innermost layer a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which is correct. Then, each subsequent layer builds on that, and finally, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. The innermost layer a_1 is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. The final result is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, which is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one isn't too bad. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to model that. Let\u2019s denote L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, from layer 1 to layer 9, but actually, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Wait, let me see: The innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the number of layers is 9, so a_9 would be the value at the innermost part, but wait, no, actually, in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result of the innermost 1 + 3*(...). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524 as I computed earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula I derived: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponentiation. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and the solution is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But wait, a_0 isn't defined in our case. Alternatively, since a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I found earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value at each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's another way to think about it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L1. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I think it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term +1. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L9 directly. L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express 3*L9 as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using exponents. That's pretty cool because it avoids computing each layer step by step, which can be time-consuming, especially if there are many layers. In this case, since there are nine layers, it's manageable, but if there were, say, 20 layers, the formula would be much more efficient. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and deriving the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently. I think I've got it right.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, each layer a_n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check with another method to make sure. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9524 = 88572.

It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find D. Let me rearrange the recurrence: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to ensure that the formula is consistent. Let's compute a_5 using the formula: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Wait, that's getting messy. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Let me check that: 29000*3 is indeed 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Adding 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000=88000, 88000 + 572=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), this is a recursive sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12=13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2=1 +39=40. a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121. a_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +363=364. a_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +1092=1093. a_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3279=3280. a_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +9840=9841. a_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +29523=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2)=3C -1/2. So, 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer. So, each a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The formula we derived is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the manual computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues up to Layer 9, which is 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should just do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Finally, 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should result in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nNext: The next digit is the 9 in the ten-thousands place. 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right:\n\n4: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the digits are 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would make 88572. But let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, is that correct? Let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the original expression has nine layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter 3, we have (1 + 3(...). So each time we see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 3(1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer: 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, my earlier computation is correct because I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), and working outwards, each layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a similar expression with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, step by step: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to hold. Therefore, my computation of the original problem should be correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nFinal answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the final value after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) That's 9 layers, right? Each time we have 1+3(...), so 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.

Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to do it step by step.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. Then, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step as I did before is manageable. However, for a deeper understanding, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which makes me more confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I think I've verified it sufficiently. So, after computing each layer step by step and confirming with a closed-form formula, I can be sure that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off because 3*29524 is 88572. Let me check that with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that. Actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + m. The solution is a_n = a_0*k^n + m*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). In our case, k = 3 and m = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = a_0*3^n + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = a_0*3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But in our case, a_1 = 4. So, let's see if we can find a_0. Wait, maybe it's better to adjust the indices. Let me think. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, using the formula: a_1 = a_0*3^1 + (3^1 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. But we know a_1 = 4, so 3*a_0 + 1 = 4 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, the general formula is a_n = 1*3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me think. The expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a geometric series helps simplify the computation. So, in summary, the problem involves a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which in this case is layer 9. Then, multiplying that result by 3 gives the final answer. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which could help in computing it more efficiently. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is following a certain recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of Layer n. Then, L_1 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for L_n, which could then help me compute L_9 more efficiently. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula holds for all the layers I computed earlier. Therefore, I can use this formula to find L_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, which is 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, it's manageable either way. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and setting up a recurrence relation, I was able to derive a formula that allows me to compute the value without having to calculate each layer individually, which would be time-consuming and prone to errors. It's always helpful to look for patterns and possible mathematical formulations when dealing with repetitive structures like this. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's write down the first few terms:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThe homogeneous solution for the recurrence L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to cross-verify using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with such a lengthy computation.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), starting with \\(1 + 3\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So, then the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a geometric series. But in this case, since each term depends on the previous one, the recursive approach worked well. So, after computing each layer step by step, and then verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's solve it:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used the recurrence relation method, and both led me to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524.

Let me compute it as 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute each layer, I'm getting each step correctly, but I want to make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses. So starting from the innermost, I have nine layers. So Layer 1 to Layer 9. So my computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check with a different approach to make sure. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's see:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula here. Let me see the ratio between each term and the previous one:\n\nL2 / L1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\nL3 / L2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.0769\n\nL4 / L3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025\n\nL5 / L4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\n\nL6 / L5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\n\nWait, that's interesting. It seems that as n increases, the ratio approaches 3. So maybe each Ln can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this hypothesis.\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes! So the formula for Ln is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this formula approach confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using the formula for each layer Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me confirm with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let's see. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, etc., up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a9. So, let me see if there's a recursive formula here. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern. a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, same as before. Then 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition. For n=1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a9, n=9:\n\na9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step without layers to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally:\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3:\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. Therefore, I can conclude that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern which can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that because when I did it step by step, I think I might have made a mistake in the digits. Alternatively, maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3. Let's do it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\nFinally, the leading 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should write it down vertically:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n   Let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7.\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit (thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 thousands place is 7.\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 7, carryover 2.\nNext digit (hundred-thousands place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 hundred-thousands place is 7, carryover 1.\nNext digit (millions place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 millions place is 7.\nNext digit (ten-millions place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 ten-millions place is 7, carryover 2.\nFinally, the hundred-millions place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, it should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step without confusion:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\nNow, since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 to the next higher place, which would be the ten-thousands place. So, we have 2 carried over, making it 2 in that place.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 29,524. So, 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my earlier computations because I think I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Thus, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Thus, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final answer was 88,572, but when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount when dealing with multiple parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, hold on, that's 9 opening parentheses, but when I started computing, I only went up to Layer 9, which would correspond to 9 layers. But in the expression, after the first 3(, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the layers in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the next is 1+3(, which is the first layer. Then each subsequent 3( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of 3( after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, which matches my earlier computation. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern that can be generalized, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, another thought: Each layer seems to follow a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nYes, so each layer n is equal to 3*(layer n-1) + 1.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go back through each layer. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), so when I computed up to Layer 9, that should be correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there a formula for such expressions? Because each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps we can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a particular solution of the form a_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure about the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers by the number of 3s multiplied. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because each time you add another 3(...). So, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, there are 8 more layers. Wait, no, actually, let's count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, a_9 is indeed the innermost expression, and the outermost is 3*a_9. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which as we saw, leads to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*a_9 =88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we find it equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., as I computed before. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\n3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula, which might be quicker for larger n, but since n=9 isn't too large, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an error with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check 3^10 again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88,572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, so the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Which can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Using the formula for a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. But since we've already found a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I think that's sufficient. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3. But let me check if I correctly counted the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) with nine layers, right? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears inside. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer9, which is the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that part is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the computations for each layer because a small mistake early on could throw off the entire result.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did Layer9, I think I might have made a mistake.

That's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, that's not the right way to break it down.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's see: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carries. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify that because 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute it another way. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, did I compute all the layers correctly? Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote the innermost expression as x. Let's say we have n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, for each layer, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3. So, for each layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in general, for k layers, the value would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with k layers. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for this. Let's see:\n\nLet\u2019s denote S(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So,\n\nS(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\nS(2) = 1 + 3*S(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nS(3) = 1 + 3*S(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nS(4) = 1 + 3*S(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nAnd so on.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for S(n). Let me try to solve this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nS(n) = 3*S(n-1) + 1, with S(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve such equations is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\nS(n) - 3*S(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is S_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution S_p(n). Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say S_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolve for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S(n) = S_h(n) + S_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, S(1) = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nS(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for n=9 layers, S(9)=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*S(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer. So, I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). This repeats nine times.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let S(n) represent the value of the expression with n layers. The recurrence is:\n   - S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1) = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**:\n   - The homogeneous solution is S_h(n) = C*3^n.\n   - A particular solution is S_p(n) = -1/2.\n   - Combining these, the general solution is S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**:\n   - S(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
