    "text": " Maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 7 7 8 5 2 4? Wait, no, let me do it step by step. Let's write 29524 as:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\nx      3\n----------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carried) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carried) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12. So, 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. So, 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. So, 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me verify with another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, layer by layer, to ensure that I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me write down each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the computations. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation and the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If we expand it, it's like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which when expanded, would result in a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try expanding Layer 9:\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))).\n\nIf I expand this, it would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1, because there are 9 layers, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8.\n\nWait, let's see: Each time you expand a layer, you're adding another power of 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nHere, r=3, n=9 terms (from 3^0 to 3^8). So, S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but earlier I found Layer 9 as 29524, which is different. So, this seems contradictory. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which when expanded, gives 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} for n layers. But in our case, Layer 9 is built from 8 layers inside, so maybe it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, which is 9 terms, as I thought.\n\nBut according to my earlier computation, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. But according to the geometric series sum, Layer 9 should be 9841. Wait, that can't be. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me clarify. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4 is 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6 is 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7 is 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8 is 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524, but the sum up to 3^8 is 9841. So, how does that relate?\n\nWait, perhaps each Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Let me check.\n\nSum from k=0 to 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is Layer 1.\n\nSum from k=0 to 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is Layer 2.\n\nSum from k=0 to 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is Layer 3.\n\nSum from k=0 to 4: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, which is Layer 4.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in that case, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches Layer 9 as 29524. So, yes, each Layer n is the sum up to 3^n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a geometric series sum, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another term)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when I saw the original expression, it's 3*(...), so each layer is inside another 3*(...). So, the way I computed it, starting from the innermost, each time I compute the innermost, then plug into the next one, so on. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1: 1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 4, but let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the first layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which would be a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (a_0 + c/(1 - r)) * r^n - c/(1 - r). Wait, but in this case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost: Each time I see a (1+3(...)), so let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3(1+3(...))\n3. Continuing this, up to 9 times. Wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, each time wrapping another 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the expression as having 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...), then the total number of layers is 9, so n=9 in the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and this is a linear recurrence, as I did before, leading to a closed-form solution. So, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, and each step seems consistent. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which would have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote a_n as the nth term, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. Similarly, a_3 =1 +3*a_2=1+39=40, and so on. So, in general, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, to avoid computing each term individually. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2=3A => 9/2=3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost term, which is a_1=4, and moving outwards, each layer corresponds to a higher n. Since there are nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9 corresponds to a_9= (3^{9+1} -1)/2= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern. Wait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, let's see if there's a formula for a geometric series here. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step, as I did before, and arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, especially with multiplication, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Let me write it properly:\n\n   29524\n*     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom, it's 7 7 8 5 2, but wait, that's not correct because the digits are:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit positions: 4, 2, 5, 9, 5, 2 (but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, right? Wait, no: 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So when multiplying:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +2=8: write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo the result is 8 8 5 7 2, but wait, that can't be because 29524*3 is 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 +9524= 88572. Yes, so 29524*3=88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let's go step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then 3*29524=88572 Correct. So yes, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 11 7 7 5 8 2 4. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 step by step.

So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n     29524\n   \u00d7     3\n   ---------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo writing it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer, so let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, since there are nine \"1+3(\" sections.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... Up to the ninth layer.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, and after computing that, we multiply by 3.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3\u00d7previous term, it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A\u00d73^{n} + C\n\nWhere A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution.\n\nTo find C, we set a_n = C, so:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = A\u00d73^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A\u00d73^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)\u00d73^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by solving the recurrence relation to find a general formula, which gave me the same result. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carryover.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 27?

So, 29524 *3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested with each term being 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 +3. Then L_2 = 1 +3L_1, L_3=1 +3L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nThen L_n = 1 + 3(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nBut L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B, so:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 =4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nThus, A=(9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this without computing each layer by using the formula directly. Since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, we find Layer 9 equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over = 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 9, but wait, 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7 \u21927\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7 \u21927\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's more of a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the general formula is correct. Let me test it for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one, eventually leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Hmm, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me verify a few layers again. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. To solve this, I can expand the recursion. Let's see:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\nL_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\nAnd so on.\n\nWait a minute, this looks like each L_n is 1 plus 3 times the sum of 3^0, 3^1, ..., 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me think. If I expand L_n:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\nContinuing this way, it becomes a sum of powers of 3 plus 1.\n\nActually, let's compute the expansion for L_n:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n * L_0\n\nWait, but L_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, since each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, starting from L_1.\n\nIf we think of this as a recurrence relation, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's take n=1: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula holds for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which makes me more confident that it's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough, so I can conclude that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recast the layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, but since it's only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me think. Each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, a_1 is 1+3=4. Then a_2=1+3*a1=1+12=13, as before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, to find a_9, and then multiply by 3. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c-1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, c=3, d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} -1)/(3 -1). But wait, our initial term is a_1=4. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me check. If n=1, a1=4=1 +3*a0, so a0=(a1 -1)/3=(4-1)/3=1. So, a0=1. Then, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * a0 + (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1). So, a_n = 3^{n} *1 + (3^{n} -1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} +3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, actually, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be:\n\nLet me check with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer from the inside out:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer computation because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake there. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which we computed as 88572. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...)), so that's one layer. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\nFrom the original expression, starting after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so that's 9 layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So my computation above was correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Hmm, this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, recursively, each term is a function of the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1. Solving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, if I were to use the formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{9+1}-1)/2=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=3*(59049-1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step layers. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace my steps to ensure I didn't make a calculation error in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. So that seems correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I feel like I might have made a mistake because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Let me try computing Layer 8 again: Layer8:1 +3*Layer7. Layer7 was 3280. So 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems right. Then Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can use a different approach to verify this result. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a function of the previous one. This kind of structure is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, the sequence is defined recursively. Let me compute the terms step by step: a1=4 a2=1+3*4=13 a3=1+3*13=40 a4=1+3*40=121 a5=1+3*121=364 a6=1+3*364=1093 a7=1+3*1093=3280 a8=1+3*3280=9841 a9=1+3*9841=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{10}=59049. Then, 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that also gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(next nested term).

Let's add: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier because the layers seem to be growing exponentially, and 88572 seems a bit large. Let me double-check each layer computation to ensure I didn't make an error. Let's go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, maybe that's correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this recursively. The general formula for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

That's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, especially with the same coefficients, there might be a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that could represent this expression more efficiently.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. That sounds familiar\u2014it resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 4.\n\nBut in the original expression, we have 9 layers. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))).\n\nSo, the innermost parentheses is layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13, and so on, up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8).\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9).\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more. Since the expression has 9 layers, does that mean n=9 in our formula? Yes, because we start from layer 1 as the innermost, so layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of a single formula without computing each layer, but in this case, since we've already computed it both step by step and using the formula, and both agree, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute it again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u21925, carry 1.\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more quickly, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could help. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the ninth layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can double-check my calculations to be sure. Let me recompute a few layers using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds, and thus the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing up to Layer 9, we find it equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct).

Let me compute this another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Perfect, that's the same as before. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any errors in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me check one more time by computing a few layers again. Let's go from Layer 1 to Layer 3 again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

So, writing it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then I multiply by 3. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...)), each time there's a new opening parenthesis. So, from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. So, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then, moving out, each time it's 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many times does this happen? The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments. Starting after the first 3, each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. So, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each \"(\" after that is a new layer.

Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the first 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3, which is the outermost 3. So, my calculation was correct, and the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model it that way. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n... and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each layer step by step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I computed each layer correctly because that seems like a lot of steps, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out, so the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it can be represented recursively. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=D. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 27 (from 9*3) followed by 8, then 28 (but wait, no, that's not correct. Let me write it digit by digit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 29524 * 3 step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nThere are no more digits, but the carry over is 2, so write that down.\n\nWait, that would give 2 8 8 5 7 2? Wait, no, that seems off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nUnits place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together from left to right: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 7 (units), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because when writing the number, the digits are written from the highest place to the lowest, so it should be 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 7 (units), and the last digit from the units place is 2. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, when you multiply 29524 by 3, you start from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit is 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Wait, let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then the final answer is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that's the result.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So then 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused because when I did the addition earlier, 29524 + 29524 + 29524, I got 88572, which matches the multiplication. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's break down 29524 into parts:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 * 500 = 1500.\n\n3 * 20 = 60.\n\n3 * 4 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers earlier, let me recompute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, let me check if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Yes, that works. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n. But since n=9 isn't too large, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early could have saved time, but since I was just starting, breaking it down step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result, leading up to the ninth layer, which evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous expression})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so going back, I had Layer 9 as 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. It's easy to make an error in these nested expressions.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because when I computed 3*9,841, I thought it was 29,523, which is correct because 9,841 * 3 = 29,523, and then adding 1 gives 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.

So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost expression and working step by step, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the simplest way. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers to make it faster. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 4 Layer 2: 13 = 4*3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 13*3 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 40*3 + 1 Layer 5: 364 = 121*3 + 1 Layer 6: 1093 = 364*3 + 1 Layer 7: 3280 = 1093*3 + 1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3280*3 + 1 Layer 9: 29524 = 9841*3 + 1 So each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems consistent. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3n + 1, where n is the previous layer. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a recurrence relation to find a general formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we determine that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about whether this expression fits a known mathematical formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is defined by that recurrence. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. In general, for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the closed-form solution is a_n = (c*r^{n} - c)/(r - 1) + initial term adjustments. Wait, perhaps I should derive it properly.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 =88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula\u2014we arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the closed-form solution and compute the result step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested form where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value at the nth layer.

Let's denote L(n) as the value of layer n, starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, actually, let me think. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1.\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers up to n=9.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3 * 29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by standard multiplication:\n\n    29524\n  x     3\n  --------\n    88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost layer:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Alternatively, it's a recursive expression where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=1+3=4, then a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, the nth term is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let's solve for C. When n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but since each a_n is finite, maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve it using iteration. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the closed-form would require solving the recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I went through each step carefully, and the formula checks out with the manual computation. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution and confirm that the final value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nThere's no more digits, so write down the 2 carried over? Wait, no, 2 * 3 is 6, plus 2 carried over is 8, but the next digit is the ten-thousands place, which is 2. So, actually, 2 * 3 is 6, plus 0 carryover, so it's 6, but wait, the original number is 29,524, so the digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, we have:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.

So Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which would save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 27. So yes, it's 88572. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so exponent is 10. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern in the layers that can be used to compute the result more efficiently. But since I've already solved it both by iterative computation and by finding a closed-form formula, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute the layers again quickly using the formula. L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =4. L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. L_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and applying the recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value before the outermost multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers Using Recurrence Relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\):**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3 for the Outermost Layer:**\n   - Final Result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.

Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yeah, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested recurrence where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives a_9=29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without going through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can write this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9 (since we have 9 layers from the innermost to the outermost), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me confirm: n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches what I calculated earlier.

Maybe add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming, but let's try:\n\n29524 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me add:\n\n 29524\n+29524\n--------\n?\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write 9, carry 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have simplified this computation without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, but in our case, the layers go from 1 to 9, right? So, for example, a_1 = 4, which should be (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each layer without having to compute each step manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem can be solved by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, finding its closed-form solution, and then computing the value for the required number of layers. This approach avoids the need for repetitive calculations and is more scalable.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are:\n\nPosition: 5 4 3 2 1\nDigits:    2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo writing it together: 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88752.

Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 88572 again. But when I multiplied digit by digit, I got 88752. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the digit multiplication again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo the result should be 88752. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. Hmm, which one is correct? Let me check with another method. Let's compute 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 90000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. So that confirms that 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication must have been incorrect. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, maybe I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7     3\n   -----------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, writing it together, the product is 88752. But according to the addition method, it's 88572. There's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it again, carefully:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 8\n\nSo the product is 88752. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a problem here. Let me check the addition again.\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding the units: 4 + 4 = 8\nTens: 2 + 2 = 4\nHundreds: 5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write down 0, carryover 1\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write down 9, carryover 1\nTen-thousands: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, adding 59048 + 29524:\n\nUnits: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 1\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so the addition gives 88572, but the digit-by-digit multiplication gives 88752. That means I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check it again.\n\nWait, I think I see the mistake. When I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I wrote the digits in the wrong order. Let me write it properly:\n\nThe number is 29524, which is:\n\nDigit positions (from right): 1:4, 2:2, 3:5, 4:9, 5:2.\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nPosition 1: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\nPosition 2: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7\nPosition 3:5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1\nPosition 4:9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\nPosition 5:2\u00d73=6 +2=8\n\nSo the result is 8 (position 5), 8 (position 4), 7 (position 3), 5 (position 2), 2 (position 1). Wait, that's 88752. But the addition gives 88572. There's a conflict. I must have messed up the positions. Let me write the number correctly:\n\n29524 is:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)\n9 (thousands)\n5 (hundreds)\n2 (tens)\n4 (units)\n\nSo when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 (units) \u00d73=12 \u2192 units digit 2, carryover 1\n2 (tens) \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit 7\n5 (hundreds) \u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds digit 5, carryover 1\n9 (thousands) \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit 8, carryover 2\n2 (ten thousands) \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands digit 8\n\nSo the product is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 88752.\n\nBut when adding 29524 three times, I got 88572. So which one is correct? Let me check with another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3 using another approach.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d73\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 +12 = 88572\n\nSo that confirms that 29524 \u00d73 =88572.\n\nTherefore, my earlier digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. I think I misaligned the digits when writing down the result. Let me try that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 units digit 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit 7\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds digit 5, carryover 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit 8, carryover 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands digit 8\n\nSo writing it together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88572, which matches the addition method. So I must have written it wrong earlier. So the correct product is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out.

Let me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, correct. Then 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if the layers follow a particular sequence. Let's list the layers again with their results:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) +1. Let me check if that holds:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 +1 = 13, correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 +1 = 40, correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 +1 = 121, correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 +1 = 364, correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 +1 = 1093, correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093 +1 = 3280, correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280 +1 = 9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841 +1 = 29524, correct.\n\nSo each layer is indeed following the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, starting with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K +1\n\nK - 3K =1\n\n-2K=1\n\nK= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\n3C =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nC= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n=9 is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about the entire expression is that it's 3 times a_9, which is 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 ). So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Wait, let me compute that.\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting with a_1 = 4. By solving the recurrence, we find that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, carryover 2, write 7. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1, write 7. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 2*3=6, then 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. But with carryovers: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check with actual multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer would be 88572. But let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121... Wait, 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 3*4 +1, 40 is 3*13 +1, 121 is 3*40 +1, and so on. It seems like each term is following the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. Wait, but actually, L1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Then L2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. Let me plug in n=1: L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's plug in n=2: L2 = 3*L1 +1 = 3*4 +1 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: L2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) and 9A + B = 13 (from n=2). Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Let me simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have Layer 9, so n=9. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*(L9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.
