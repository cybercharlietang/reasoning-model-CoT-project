    "text": " 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nNow, the next digit is 9 (from 29524), but wait, 29524 has only five digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So, when I multiply, it's:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7      3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. So:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524.\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n\n0 + 5 = 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carry 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Yep, that matches. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed Layer 9 correctly. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me check each layer computation again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is multiplying the entire expression by 3. So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, substituting n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B\n\nAnd for n=0, if we consider a_0, but since the problem starts at a_1, maybe it's better to find the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nThen, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, all the computations check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without expanding all layers, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), computing each layer step by step is feasible.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0. So, reading from the top, the digits are 8,7,8,7,2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but since each layer is just 1 + 3 times the next layer, it's a simple recursive computation. So, I think my step-by-step approach is solid.\n\nI guess another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric progression, but with each term being 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nBut since L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the equation:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if there are many layers. But since I only have nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's a finite geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each layer. Wait, actually, it's more like a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But since I already derived the formula for L_n, I can use that.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the innermost value, then work my way out, multiplying each time by 3 and adding 1. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern allows me to use the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which gives me the same result. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering the number of layers, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of parentheses to see how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Starting from the first one after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, which I computed correctly. So, 9 layers, each computed correctly, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions that could lead to a quicker solution, but since I'm just starting out, I think computing each layer step by step is the way to go. I don't recall a specific formula for this, but perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, recursively, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's find the general solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. It works! So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would correspond to n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the formula derived from the linear recurrence, I arrive at the same final answer of 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a linear recurrence relation. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's multiply each digit from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nThere's a 0 before the 2, so 0 * 3 = 0, but since we're done with all digits, that's it.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524 should be more than 80,000. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer a_9 is 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's manageable manually. Let me think if there's a formula for such expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see, each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 4. So, the recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b is L(n) = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), provided a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. So, the solution would be L(n) = 3^n * C + (1)/(1 - 3) = 3^n * C - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = 3^1 * C - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is right.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2\n\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo putting it all together: 87 (from the last digits) and then 7,5,7,2.

Let me write it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, so 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was trying to compute digit by digit, I think I messed up because I wasn't considering the place values correctly.

But let me double-check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step to make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to express a_n.\n\nWe can write a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWe can find B by substituting into the recurrence.\n\nLet\u2019s assume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstitute:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, LHS = A*3^n + B\n\nRHS = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

So putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,5,8,8,7,7,7,8. Wait, that doesn't seem right because I think I messed up the carries. Maybe I should do it step by step: 29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Millions place: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n- Ten-millions place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundred-millions place: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Billions place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, that's 8 digits, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so maybe I went too far. Let me correct that. 29524 is 5 digits, so when multiplying by 3, the result will be up to 6 digits. Let me do it again carefully:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands: 9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands: 2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n- So, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's only 5 digits. Let me check: 29524 * 3 = ?\n\nLet me compute it another way:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I was getting 88572, which matches this method. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds on the previous one correctly. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? So starting from the innermost as Layer 1, each subsequent layer is built by wrapping the previous one. So Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So yes, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2.

Wait, let me verify that multiplication. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So, adding those: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, 58000 + 1000 = 59000, 59000 + 40 = 59040, 59040 + 8 = 59048. Then, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524.

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, it's going to grow exponentially. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. This expression looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct). For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct). For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct). So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to confirm: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Alright, so after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the calculations, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation method, we derive a formula to compute the value of each layer efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the number is 29524, which is a 5-digit number. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 7, 7. Wait, that would be 77852. But that can't be right because 3 \u00d7 29524 should be 88572. Let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the digits are 2 (from 4\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73+1), 5 (from 5\u00d73), 8 (from 9\u00d73+1), 7 (from 5\u00d73+2), 7 (from 2\u00d73+1). So, the number is 7 7 8 5 2 7? Wait, that doesn't make sense. I think I'm getting confused with the order. Let me write it as:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nFirst digit: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nSecond digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nThird digit: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nFourth digit: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\nFifth digit: 5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover 1.\n\nSixth digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing from left to right, it's 7 (from 2\u00d73+1), then 7 (from 5\u00d73+2), then 8 (from 9\u00d73+1), then 5 (from 5\u00d73), then 7 (from 2\u00d73+1), and finally 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that can't be right because the number is only five digits. I think I'm making a mistake in the number of digits. Let me count: 29524 is 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3, it's:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

So, yes, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Is it 1 +3\u00d7Layer8, where Layer8 is 9841? So, 3\u00d79841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer, it's a geometric series or something similar. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me think about it. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). This is similar to a continued fraction or a geometric progression. Let me denote the innermost term as x, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3x. But in this case, each term is built from the previous one, so it's more like a recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model it as a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 =1 +3=4.\n\nL_2=1 +3L_1=1+12=13.\n\nL_3=1 +3L_2=1+39=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nWe can see that L_n =1 +3L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation L_n =1 +3L_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)}= K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K =1 +3K \u2192 K -3K=1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 +1/2 =3C \u2192 9/2=3C \u2192 C= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 88572. Okay, that matches.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this more efficiently, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 (Wait, actually, L1 is just 1 + 3, which is 4, as we had before.) Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me see. Each layer is defined recursively by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, L1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + L_0, but I need to check the initial condition. Wait, actually, let's define it properly. Let me see: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, for n=1, L1=4. For n=2, L2=1+3*4=13. For n=3, L3=1+3*13=40, etc. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it more efficiently without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. So, the answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form formula using linear recurrence relations, I was able to compute the innermost layers more efficiently and arrive at the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write them out:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer, and each closing parenthesis ends a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, so there are nine layers. So, my computation of nine layers is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it might form a geometric progression. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3a_8\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 \u2192 r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   $1 + 3 = 4$\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the final result after computing Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me try an alternative approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), which resembles a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Alternatively, perhaps it's a form of a recurrence relation. Let me think about the general form. Suppose we have an expression where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I went through each layer step by step, then recognized the recurrence relation and solved it using the formula, which gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues up to Layer 9, which results in 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572. 87000 + 1000=88000, 88000 + 572=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursively defined sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3*C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same result as before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula method, I also get 88572. That confirms the result I obtained by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've considered both methods: the step-by-step computation and the formula approach using recurrence relations. Both lead to the same conclusion, so I don't think I made any mistakes. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure the result is accurate, especially with nested expressions that can be easy to miscalculate.

That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I just want to make sure I didn't miscount the layers or make a multiplication error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me try to model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9.\n\nWait, but hold on: in the expression, the innermost is a_1, and each layer wraps around, so the outermost is a_9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, so the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9, which is the value before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify:\n\nThe expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value of the 9th layer. So, a_1 is the innermost, a_2 is the next, up to a_9, which is the value inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nBecause n=9, so a_9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nNow, 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach, let me verify with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\na_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is a good check.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was initially unsure, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify.\n\nIn summary, the expression evaluates to 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a solution using the formula for a geometric series. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try another approach. Maybe using standard multiplication:\n\n     29524\n   x      3\n   --------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry 0.\n\nNow, the next digit is 9 (from 29524, the digits are 2,9,5,2,4). Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, we've already done 4, 2, 5, 9, and 2. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the places. Let me write it out properly:\n\n        2 9 5 2 4\n      x      3\n      --------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8, carry 0.\n\nThere are no more digits, so we're done.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but when I add the digits: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten thousands). So 88572. Hmm, but let me check with another method to be sure. Maybe adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\nTen thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 (carry) = 8, write 8.\n\nSo 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in these nested computations. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Correct.\n\nSo, all the layers check out, and the multiplication at the end is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Let me go back and verify each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me confirm the multiplication once again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nWait, but another way to check is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\nx     3\n\n------\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, and then multiplying the final result by 3, I arrive at the answer 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Each step checks out, and the final multiplication is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost 9 layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28.

Write down 8.\n\nWait, that's actually incorrect because 29524 is a 5-digit number, but I'm treating it as a 9-digit number, which it's not. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, it should be:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\nNow, since there are no more digits, write the carryover if any. Wait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the product is 88572. Wait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is computed correctly. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, in case I missed a layer or miscounted.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of times we apply the operation. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also derived a general formula which gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value.

Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let me write it as 29524. So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nThen, since there are no more digits, we have the carried over 2, write that down.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, the digits are:\n\nPosition: 5 4 3 2 1\nDigits:   2 9 5 2 4\n\nWait, actually, when multiplying, we start from the units place. So:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that's a quicker way, but I think my initial step-by-step multiplication was correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, which was 29524, we multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a step. Did I correctly compute each layer? Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(...)) => Layer 1.\n\nEach time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))).\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count:\n\nFrom the innermost, the first \"1+3\" is Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The outermost is 3*(...).\n- Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 9.\n- Inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 8.\n- And so on, until the innermost is Layer 1.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had Layer 1 as the innermost, and Layer 9 as the outermost. So, the total number of layers is 9, each corresponding to a \"1+3(\".\n\nBut when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation:\n\nLet me define a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is:\n\na_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nWait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, c = 3, d = 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = (a_0)*c^n + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, which is the first term.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to adjust the indices. Let me consider n starting at 1, so a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, the general solution would be:\n\na_n = (a_1 - d/(c - 1)) * c^{n - 1} + d/(c - 1)\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute d/(c - 1) = 1/(3 - 1) = 1/2.\n\nThen, a_1 = 4 = (a_1 - 1/2) * c^{0} + 1/2.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nWait, considering the expression as a geometric series might complicate things, but given that I've already found the solution using the recurrence relation, perhaps it's not necessary. But just for thoroughness, let me try to model it as a geometric series.\n\nEach time we have a term like 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which can be thought of as 3 + 9*(...). So, each layer adds a term that's 3 times the previous term plus 3. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated than the recurrence approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a geometric series, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with 9 layers. But perhaps the recurrence method is more straightforward here.\n\nIn any case, both methods have led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expression using another method, perhaps by expanding the entire expression step by step without using the formula.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times. Each step seems correct, and the formula approach also confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) layers. Starting from the innermost: Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a layer. Let's count them. The innermost is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing up, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), and the outermost is 3 times that.

Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me retrace my steps:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check Layer 8 again: Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(9841). So 3*9841: Let's compute that correctly. 9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523. Then add 1: 29523 +1=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. But let me check the initial expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the parentheses. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... Up to the ninth layer because the outermost is 3*(...). Wait, actually, the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is the ninth layer. So I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it in a different way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of times the expression repeats. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if we have 9 layers, that would correspond to a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to approach it using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That's pretty cool. It saves a lot of time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. But since in this problem, there are only 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable, but it's good to know the formula in case the layers increase. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try that approach. Starting from the innermost layer, each time we have 1 + 3*(something). If we expand this, maybe we can express it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Let's consider the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1. Wait, 3^1 + 1 = 4, which is correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Which can be written as 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3^1. Similarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Which is 1 + 3*(3^2 + 3^1 + 1) = 1 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1. Wait, so each layer adds another term in the geometric series. So, for Layer n, it's equal to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. But wait, in our case, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^1 + 1. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe each Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, indeed, each Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as we found before. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series pattern\u2014we arrive at the same result. It's reassuring to see that different approaches lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I've thought this through thoroughly, checked my work using multiple methods, and each time, I get the same result. So, I'm pretty confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so I shouldn't have more digits than that. Let me try again, perhaps using a different method. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Compute each part: 20000*3=60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if I can model this. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's try that. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Plugging in a_n = C*3^n + D: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2 So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern at first, I could have computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computation earlier. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.

Okay, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To find a closed-form solution for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the closed-form formula earlier to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time. But since I was just starting out, computing each layer step by step was a good way to ensure I didn't make a mistake. It's always good to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer iteratively or using the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form solution, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested set where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, so 7 with a carryover of 2. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check that step again because maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But let me check this multiplication again to be sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out from right to left: 2, 7, 8, 5, 8? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the digits would be 2 (units), 7 (tens), 8 (hundreds), 5 (thousands), 8 (ten thousands). Wait, that would make the number 88572, which is correct. So, 88572 is the correct result. But let me just verify by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, it's 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method to confirm. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back and check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(...), and each layer is 1 + 3*(...). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), each starting after the initial 3. So, that's 9 layers, meaning Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the one before the final multiplication by 3. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer as 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me verify this because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me write down each layer again with their computed values to ensure I didn't skip any or make a multiplication error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, each layer seems correctly computed, and the final multiplication is accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 29524 seems like a large number, and multiplying by 3 gives a much larger number. Let me check the calculations for each layer again to ensure there are no errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

So putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryover. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it step by step: 29524 * 3.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, but this seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the general formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is building up a number based on powers of 3. The innermost part is 4, which is 3 +1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous value plus 1. So, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nEach time, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to stick with the step-by-step computation since the formula is confirmed.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d73=27000\n\n500 \u00d73=1500\n\n20 \u00d73=60\n\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, but when I computed each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them.\n\nLet me go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But let me check if I miscounted the layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount when you have multiple layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 (Layer 1)\n\nThen 1+3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n\nThen 1+3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my computation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing very quickly, so I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each step seems accurate. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form solution or recognize a pattern.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r-3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, a_1=4, which according to the formula would be (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches our earlier computation.\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which also matches.\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\na_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\na_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\na_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\na_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\na_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is what we got earlier.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. The expression is a geometric series with ratio 3, but let me see if I can express it that way.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))). So, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and summed up.\n\nBut in this case, since it's nested, it's more efficient to use the recurrence relation approach, which we've already done.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). We computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and found that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Then, we multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula using the recurrence relation supports the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outwards**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
