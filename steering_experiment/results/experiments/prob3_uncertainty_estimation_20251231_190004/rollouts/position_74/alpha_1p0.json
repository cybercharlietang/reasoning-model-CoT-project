Let me recount each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, we can think of it as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, yes, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach also leads me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. That looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n, where L_1=4, as we computed. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test that. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula and see if it matches my earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: (27-1)/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243-1)/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, all layers compute correctly with the formula. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because I might have made an error in one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I believe the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that could be represented by a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it might form a geometric progression. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me consider that each layer is a term in a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression to verify the result. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, no, actually, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, if I had used the formula earlier, I could have computed it directly.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, so the total would be 88,572? Wait, that seems quite large. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula or a pattern that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent a_n is built by the same formula. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursion is linear and homogeneous, so maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. The general form of such a recursion is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recursion is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(r - 1)), where A is a constant determined by the initial condition. Let me verify that. For n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (1/(3 - 1)) = 3A + 1/2. But we know a_1 = 4, so 3A + 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => A = 7/(2*3) = 7/6. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (7/6)*3^n + (1/2). Simplifying, since 3^n is 3*3^{n-1}, so (7/6)*3^n = (7/2)*3^{n-1}. Alternatively, a_n = (7/2)*3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I computed a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So my formula must be incorrect. Let me see where I went wrong. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me rederive it properly. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recursion: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches my earlier computation. Good. So the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in the original problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So from the innermost, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers because each time we have a 1 + 3(...), and the outermost is multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of 1+3(...). The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So n=9 layers. Therefore, using the general formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))))))))) Wait, no, actually, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, each additional layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer wraps another 1 + 3 around it. So, the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. Therefore, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...).

Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1. Solving for A: A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the outermost layer's value, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a formula, which confirmed the step-by-step computation. It's always good to check your work, especially with so many layers involved. I might have made a calculation error if I didn't double-check, but since both methods align, I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see. Alternatively, since it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, I can solve it by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm. Let me try computing the expression from the inside out, step by step, without using the formula, just to make sure. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4. Then moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13)=1+39=40. Next: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Then:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Next:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Then:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Then:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up to 29524 at the outermost layer. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

For n=1, L1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging into the formula: (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would have worked.\n\nWait, perhaps not necessary, since the recurrence approach worked smoothly. But just to explore, let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1.\n\nBut I think the recurrence approach was more straightforward here. So, using the formula I derived, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding it.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand this step by step, but that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can see that each layer adds a power of 3.\n\nWait, but the recurrence approach seems more efficient. Since each layer Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, and we've already solved that, maybe I can stick with that method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for a finite geometric series. Let me consider that.\n\nEach time, we have a term that's 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Wait, but in this case, the expression is finite, so it's a finite nested expression. So, maybe I can model it as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think. Let me denote E as the innermost expression. So, starting from the innermost, E1=1+3, E2=1+3*E1, E3=1+3*E2, and so on up to E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but that's exactly what I did before. So, perhaps using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence is the way to go.\n\nIn any case, I've computed it step by step, and using the formula, both methods gave me the same result of 88572. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step.\n2. Recognize the recurrence relation Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4.\n3. Solve the recurrence relation to find a formula for Ln.\n4. Use the formula to compute L9 directly.\n5. Multiply L9 by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis systematic approach helped me avoid errors and ensured that each step was correct before moving on to the next. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, as both methods led to the same result. So, I think I'm good!\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Wait, but let's check: When n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4, which matches. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms my earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\).

Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, yes. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, I can check this using another approach, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's find the homogeneous solution first. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. What is the initial condition? When n=1, L_1 =1 +3=4. So plug n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 =>4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n-1. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me denote a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 +39=40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\nSimplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n, so we have:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n-2B = 1\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) and Layer 9 is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which is the same answer as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me check my earlier computations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent term a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each term step by step. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same result.

Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 that I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, the recursive approach worked well. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I think that's correct.

Therefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I feel like this number is quite large, and I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n, which could save time instead of computing each layer.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince our problem has 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9 layers, this would be (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which confirms our earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the result directly without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for a larger number of layers.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nSo, in summary, the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9):\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to recognize the pattern. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 more than three times the previous term. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n, and the total expression is 3*a_n. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is consistent with my previous calculation. So, using both the step-by-step expansion and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost value is found to be 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, so 3*29524. As we computed earlier, that's 88572. Hmm, but let me just check once more because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miss a step or miscalculate. Let me go through each layer once more quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be expressed using a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I have a term like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, in our problem, the innermost expression is a_1=4, then a_2=13, etc., up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can see that it's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the linear recurrence, I end up with the same answer, 88572.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's built recursively. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's try to compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and using the closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to confirm the result. The final computation confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step is manageable. I don't recall a specific formula for such expressions, but perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar could help. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n is defined recursively. Solving such a recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression, which could be useful for larger numbers of layers. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This method is much faster and avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. But since in this problem there are only nine layers, both methods work fine.

Suppose I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Suppose we have a term defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c). Wait, in this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c). Let's compute that. First, compute d/(1 - c): 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Then, a_1 = 4. So, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). Simplify inside the parentheses: 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, a_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let me compute 9*6561: 6561*9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 +9=59049. So, (9*6561)=59049. Then, divide by 2: 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we can set up the system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same result as before. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see how that would expand. Let me try expanding a smaller version to see the pattern. Suppose I have just one layer: 3*(1 + 3) =3*4=12. Two layers:3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(13)=39. Three layers:3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*40)=3*121=363. Wait, but earlier, for three layers, I had Layer 3 as 40, so 3*40=120, but in the two-layer case, it's 3*(1 + 3*4)=39. Wait, perhaps my approach is a bit different. Maybe I need to consider that each expansion adds another 3*... So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers, which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (a(r^{n} - 1))/(r - 1). But in this case, each term is 3^{k} for k from 0 to n. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, so it's more like a recurrence relation as I did earlier. But since I've already found that the closed-form for Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9 layers, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. So, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, if I think about expanding the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, the innermost term is 1 + 3, then each layer outwards multiplies by 3 and adds 1. So, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3^{k} + 3^{k-1} + ... +3 +1, but that might not be exactly correct because each layer is only 1 + 3*next layer. Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recurrence relation method since that worked well. Let me just confirm that my initial step-by-step computation of each layer up to 29524 was correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. The key was to recognize the pattern and compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the layers saved time and reduced the chance of error. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could represent this expression. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers here is only nine, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But for the sake of thoroughness, let me try to derive a formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit more involved. But the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found.\n\nSince there are 9 layers, n=9, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the steps. Each computation checks out, both manually and via the formula.

Wait, but let me check each step again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer computation to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to model it mathematically. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, the recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1). Let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. So, using the formula saved me time and reduced errors. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is a term in a geometric progression, but the formula approach seems more straightforward. Either way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value.

Applying this formula to the outermost layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next inner term).

For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524.

So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Then, the nth term can be expressed as a_n = (3^n -1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2=1, but our a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Looking at these numbers, let's see if they follow a pattern. Let me see the ratio between successive terms: 13/4=3.25, 40/13\u22483.077, 121/40\u22483.025, 364/121\u22483.008, 1093/364\u22483.000, and so on. It seems to approach 3 as n increases, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c -1). Wait, let me recall the correct formula. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + b*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1). In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, k=3, b=1. The initial condition is a_1=4. Wait, but in the standard formula, a_0 is the initial term. Let me adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 as the term when n=0, which in our case would be the innermost term before any layers. Wait, in our problem, the innermost term is a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1. So, perhaps a_0 would be 1, but that's not how our problem is structured. Alternatively, maybe I should adjust the formula to fit our problem. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me consider n layers. The innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can model this as a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1: a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the outermost 3 multiplies the 9th layer, which is a_9=29524, giving 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by deriving a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are nine layers, right? Because each time, we have a 1+3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another one. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, yes, I think I computed all nine layers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, I get the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which can be represented as a geometric series. But since I've already confirmed it with two methods, I think it's safe to say the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which might help verify my result. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the exponentiation or the arithmetic. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Then, subtracting 1 gives 59048, dividing by 2 gives 29524. Multiplying by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524 *3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which would make computing a_9 faster. Let me recall how to solve linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. Suppose a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Therefore, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^5=243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243. 243*200=48,600; 243*40=9,720; 243*3=729. Adding those together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, 3^{10}=59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with my previous result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap, since the expression is a nested one with each layer being 1 + 3 times the previous, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a closed-form solution, which saved me from computing each layer step by step. However, since the number of layers here is manageable (only nine), even computing each step manually wasn't too bad. But for more layers, the recurrence approach would be much more efficient. So, in summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and either computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, I arrived at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Since each layer is defined by L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is layer 9, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So that's another way to look at it, using the formula. That's pretty cool. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a formula. The final result is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 13\n   - Layer 3: 40\n   - Layer 4: 121\n   - Layer 5: 364\n   - Layer 6: 1093\n   - Layer 7: 3280\n   - Layer 8: 9841\n   - Layer 9: 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
