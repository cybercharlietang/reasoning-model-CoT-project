    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again. Let's see: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and less error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Since it's a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, the solution should be straightforward. Let's write it down.\n\nGiven the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Good.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all converge to the same number, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows a pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation formula, we find the value of the innermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final Answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nUsing the recurrence relation formula:\n- Each layer \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\)\n- For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n- Final Answer: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check that again because each layer is built upon the previous one, so maybe I messed up the computation earlier. Let me retrace my steps. Let's go through each layer again carefully. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So, if I compute each layer correctly, I end up with 3*(29524) = 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite large, and sometimes with these nested expressions, it's easy to make a multiplication error. Let me check a couple of layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can check each step for accuracy. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 correct.

Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is following a pattern, perhaps a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it might be a linear recurrence. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. And the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me check the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's pretty thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^{n} + (b/(a - 1)). Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*(3)^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*(3)^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the closed-form formula gives me the same result without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially for larger n. However, since the problem only has nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general solution in case the number of layers increases. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me explore that angle as well. Let's consider the entire expression as a sum. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This is a finite geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But in this case, it's nested, so it's a bit different. The closed-form approach seems more straightforward here. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, which is exactly the recurrence relation I used earlier. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. Wait, no, actually, when multiplying, we should do it digit by digit from right to left, carrying over as needed. So, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully working through each step and verifying my calculations, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a geometric progression.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is Layer 9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach gives me confidence that the step-by-step computation was correct. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, it's a recursive relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a linear recurrence relation. It can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some computation time by using the formula. But since I was initially unsure, breaking it down step by step was a good approach. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a different method, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify. Let's see, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recursive formula is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is: Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. This expression resembles a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now. I used both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same answer. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step helped a lot. I also realized that recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation made the problem easier, avoiding the need to compute each layer manually beyond a certain point. But since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. If there were more layers, the formula would definitely save a lot of time. Anyway, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value at each layer.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire result. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from the inside out. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each term seems to be 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let's check: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 +1 =13. Correct. L_3 = 3*L_2 +1 = 3*13 +1=40. Correct. L_4 = 3*L_3 +1=3*40 +1=121. Correct. So, indeed, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 =4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1=4= A*3^1 + B =3A + B. For n=0, if we consider, but since we don't have n=0, maybe we can use another approach. Alternatively, since the recurrence is L_n - 3L_{n-1} =1, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, Layer 9 is L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me verify 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 3^{11}=177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divide by 2 is 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, which might save time instead of computing each layer. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, that can be written as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would make the computation faster. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, we can write the recurrence as:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using methods for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I would have to compute each layer step by step, which I did earlier. Either way, the result is the same. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => Subtract 3A: -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

But wait, let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, perhaps? Let me consider that. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which again confirms the result. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40.

Hmm, but let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake there. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you're dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate somewhere. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so starting from the innermost: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) ... Up to 9 layers, as I thought earlier. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed correctly. So, Layer 9 is 29524, multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute the layers again quickly. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524 Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think I've got it right. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, computing each layer step by step. Each time, it's just multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric progression of sorts, but since each term is built on the previous, it's better to compute each layer individually to avoid mistakes. I didn't see an immediate formula to apply, so step-by-step computation was the way to go. It took a bit of time, but breaking it down made it manageable. I don't think I made any calculation errors this time, so I'm confident in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something like that. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way as a check. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the general solution. First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree.

Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer1: 4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.

But let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121 Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364 Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it more formally. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. At n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We need another equation. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B =13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now plug A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So that matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one of the layers again. Let's take Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 was 1093. So 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Another check: Layer 5: 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Okay, I think I've got it right. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check the multiplication again because sometimes I might miscount the layers. Wait, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1+3 adds a layer. So from the innermost 1+3, that's the first layer, and each time we wrap around, it's another layer. So the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Up to Layer 9: 1+3*Layer8=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*Layer9=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually is feasible. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2)-1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier. So that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good approach.

But wait, let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is a recursive one, where each term depends on the previous. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could have directly calculated a_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2 and then multiplied by 3. But since I already computed it step by step, and both methods agree, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because when I first saw the expression, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this rather than computing each layer manually. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each time, you're doing 1 + 3 times the previous value. This seems like a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the question is whether there's a formula for a_n. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. It's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...).

Starting from the innermost layer, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer, 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just cross-verify my computations because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, if I define each layer as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then the final result is 3*a_9. So, another way to look at it is that each a_n is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we're doing 1 + 3*something. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. Then the expression is 3*a9. So, a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, a5=1+3*121=364, a6=1+3*364=1093, a7=1+3*1093=3280, a8=1+3*3280=9841, a9=1+3*9841=29524. So, 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me think. The recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, without using the formula, since each layer is a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, starting from a1=4, up to a9. So, using the formula, we can compute a9 directly as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is a much quicker way. But since I didn't think of that initially, I had to compute each layer step by step, which took a bit longer but confirmed the result. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid because both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It looks like a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence, or using the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula.

Let me write out the terms again: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series. Let me think about it. The expression is similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, actually, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the equation: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer sequentially, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Let me go back and verify each layer computation because if I made a mistake in one layer, it will propagate through all subsequent layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without expanding each layer, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to the recurrence relation, which can be solved as above. But since I already computed each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if they match.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few layers, which gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, computing up to layer 9, we get a_9=29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer manually, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or something. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can express a_n as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula. Let's compute a_5: Using the formula, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364.
