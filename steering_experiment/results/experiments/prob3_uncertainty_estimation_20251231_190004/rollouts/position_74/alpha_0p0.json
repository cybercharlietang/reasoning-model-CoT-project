Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think I counted 9 layers because each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time there's a \"(\", so let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, actually, there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct because each layer corresponds to an opening parenthesis. So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if that approach makes sense.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method seems more efficient and confirms that the result is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Let me explore that.\n\nEach term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nBut perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series isn't directly applicable here, since each term depends on the previous one. However, by solving the recurrence relation as I did earlier, I was able to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which simplified the computation.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, or by solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. To solve it, we compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, recognizing a repeating pattern. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value at each step until the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nMultiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me recount each layer to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time I went one layer out. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers? Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each time we go out, another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let's count them: After the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, 9 layers. So, I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n = k. Plugging into the recurrence: k = 1 + 3k => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step, leading to the final result. \n\nThe expression can be simplified using a recurrence relation, which confirms the computed value of each layer. The final computation involves multiplying the result of the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which resembles a geometric progression. Let me try to model this. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, let's consider L_0 as the base case. Wait, actually, in our case, n starts at 1, but to find a general solution, we can consider n=0 as the base case. However, in our problem, L_1 is the innermost layer. Let me think differently. Let's consider the recurrence L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms our earlier result using a different method, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since the expression is a repeated multiplication, we could think of it as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, and there are 9 layers. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, starting from the innermost 1 + 3. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we found, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me check that. If L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again matches our previous results. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series\u2014we arrive at the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just cross-verify the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's more of a recursively defined sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the final expression would be 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. 29524 * 3: 29524\nx    3\n--------\nLet's compute it step by step:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That confirms it. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make any addition or multiplication mistakes. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So, all layers check out. Then, multiplying the outermost 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's recount each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been more efficient. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested. Alternatively, each layer can be seen as a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and then a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, in this case, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward. Let me just see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me some time. Looking at the layers: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9. Then, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is Lh(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution Lp = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula and see if they match my previous calculations. Layer 1: n=1, L_1=(3^2 -1)/2=4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2, L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=40. Correct. Layer 4: n=4, L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: n=5, L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Layer 6: n=6, L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer 7: n=7, L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer 8: n=8, L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer 9: n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, using the formula, I can see that each layer is correctly computed. Therefore, multiplying L_9 by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, yes, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think about the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time we have 3 multiplied by something, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward here, and it gave me the correct result.

Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly. So starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer, starting from 1 + 3. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can see that it's 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the initial computations.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we're doing this multiple times, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier result. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because if I made a mistake in computing any of the layers, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer1). Then Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^n) + (a_1*(1 - r^n))/(1 - r). Wait, actually, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation. For a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n-1}*(a_1) + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1). Let me confirm that. Alternatively, using the method of solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, where r is the root of the characteristic equation. The particular solution is a constant if c is a constant. So, let me assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we're dealing with Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have used this formula from the start to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. That might have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step wasn't too bad. Let me summarize the steps: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern. 2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses, layer by layer. 3. After computing each layer, use its value in the next outer layer. 4. Once all layers are computed up to Layer 9, multiply the result by 3. 5. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, which allows direct computation without step-by-step layer calculation. Both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 once again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I do these nested expressions, I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. Looking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many 1+3(...) there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, each time, we have a new layer. How many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time after the 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of such occurrences.\n\nFrom the innermost: (1 + 3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each next layer adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, layers 1 through 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, that's correct because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is following a pattern. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough to be confident in the result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives us the value of the outermost layer, which we then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without so many layers. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = (3/2)*3 + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, which is Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result.

Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is of the form L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's good. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers. But since I only had nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad.

But wait, let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's better to solve it step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the problem had more layers. But since this problem only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I'm confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After evaluating all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

But let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that: For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, in this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c=3, d=1. So, a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, a_1 = 3^{1}*(a_0) + (3^{1} - 1)/2. Plugging in a_1=4: 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 => 4 = 3*a_0 + 1 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, a_n = 3^{n}*(1) + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplify that: a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1. Then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, which would save time, especially if there are many layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but L_0 would be the initial term before any layers. Wait, in our case, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, so L_1 = 4. Let me check the general solution for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, where C is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = a*L_p + b => L_p - a*L_p = b => L_p*(1 - a) = b => L_p = b/(1 - a). So for our case, a=3, b=1, so L_p = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then each layer adds another, so the total number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. Each time, the number of layers increases by one. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another. So, the expression has 9 layers, because each \"1+3(\" after the initial one adds another layer, and there are 9 such. So, layer 9 is the outermost one. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I've got it.

Let me recompute each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.

Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or look for a pattern. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form solution, I still get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

That seems right. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, that's a recursive formula. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1*(r)^{n-1}) ), but wait, that formula is for a homogeneous recurrence with constant coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the solution for a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} can be found by iteration. Let me try to solve it for general n. Let's say we have a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Now, if I want to find a general formula for a_n, I can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the general formula\u2014lead to the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. This recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Then, subtracting 1 gives 59048, dividing by 2 gives 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since I already have a formula, I think this approach is correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me recheck each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a general formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just for fun, let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we also arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*previous layer. So Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2. So, we have a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. We have L_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B =4. Now, since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, we can solve for A and B. But let's see if we can find a pattern. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*previous, we can write L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: L_1=4, L_2=13, L_3=40, L_4=121, L_5=364, L_6=1093, L_7=3280, L_8=9841, L_9=29524. Hmm, each term is 3 times the previous minus something? Wait, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me see the ratio between consecutive terms: 13/4=3.25, 40/13\u22483.077, 121/40\u22483.025, 364/121\u22483.008, 1093/364\u22483.003, 3280/1093\u22483.001, 9841/3280\u22483.0003, 29524/9841\u22483.0000. So, as n increases, L_n approaches 3^{n} as the dominant term, with a smaller additive term. So, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test that. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, indeed, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a quicker way to compute it without having to go through each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, since Layer 9 is L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, and a_{n}=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps? Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1). Wait, but in this case, our a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. Hmm, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is when we ignore the +1. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}. The characteristic equation is r=3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1. Solving for B: B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to, I could have directly used the formula for a_9 and then multiplied by 3. Let me see: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes, let me verify one more layer, say Layer 5. Layer 5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1 +3*121=1+363=364. Using the formula, a_5=(3^{6}-1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Seems correct. Let me check one of the layers again to be sure. Let's pick Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121=363. 1 + 363=364. That's correct. How about Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 was 1093, so 3*1093=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, we can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*b^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a + b*K. Solving for K: K - b*K = a => K*(1 - b) = a => K = a/(1 - b). So, the general solution is L_n = C*b^n + a/(1 - b). Applying this to our case, where a=1 and b=3. So, L_n = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. What's L_1? From earlier, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, L_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the total expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I'm done then.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions, which are recursive or follow a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So that's consistent with my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that's 3 times the previous, so the entire expression without the outermost 3 would be a sum of 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I need to verify that. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's more like a geometric series with ratio 3, but not exactly. Wait, using the formula we derived earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, like expanding the entire expression, but that would be tedious given the depth of nesting. It's easier to recognize the pattern and apply the recurrence formula. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check with another method. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this more efficiently instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series, perhaps. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's write this as a recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if n=9 is correct. Because the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, then Layer 2 is a_2 = 13, up to Layer 9: a_9 = 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the entire expression using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 would be 9 times, but perhaps the formula can help me compute it without expanding each layer.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a recurrence relation, and we've already solved it, perhaps the formula can be applied directly.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the recurrence relation confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final value before the outermost multiplication by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we confirm that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting over, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

So, all layers are computed correctly. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. But for future reference, maybe recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar could help. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, these numbers are growing exponentially. To find a closed-form expression, I can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our case, the innermost layer is L_1 =4, and each subsequent layer is L_2, L_3,... up to L_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9). Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see. If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. That's pretty cool. So, by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the linear recurrence, I can compute the result more efficiently. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same answer, both methods are valid. I think the step-by-step approach is more intuitive for someone just starting out, while the formula is more efficient once you recognize the pattern. In summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. Each subsequent layer can be computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to L_9, the final step is to multiply by 3 to get the overall result, which is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Let me think if there's a recursive formula here. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, I'll recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1+3(...). Let's see: Starting from the innermost, there's one 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each layer adds another set. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): 1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer. This process continues until the outermost layer is reached, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is computed to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just cross-verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. So starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable. Wait, another thought: each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's see. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and identifying a recurrence relation, we can find the solution efficiently. The expression simplifies using a formula, leading to the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
