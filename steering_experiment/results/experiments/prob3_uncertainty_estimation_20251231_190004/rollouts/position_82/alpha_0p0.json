    "text": " Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could compute this without so many steps, but since it's only nine layers, doing each step isn't too bad. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and going up to a_9. So, a recursive formula. Maybe we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step. But either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we can find that each layer follows the relation a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer, which might be time-consuming, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. If I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might help compute the value without expanding each layer. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let me substitute into the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1 using the general solution: a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2. But a_1 = 4, so: 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 =3 *29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step expansion and the formula, I arrive at the same result.

So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved by iteration. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, let's try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let's see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yes, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. That seems consistent. Now, perhaps I can find a formula for L_n instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if this recurrence relation can be solved. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this makes sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me think about it. If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is similar to E = 3*(1 + E/3). Wait, let me see. If I let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But the part inside the first parentheses is 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to E/3 because E = 3*(...). Wait, actually, let me define it more carefully. Let me let E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Then, the part inside the first parentheses is 1 + 3*(...), which is 1 + (E/3). Because E is 3*(...), so ... is E/3. Therefore, E = 3*(1 + E/3). Let me solve this equation for E. E = 3*(1 + E/3) = 3 + E. So, E = 3 + E. Subtract E from both sides: 0 = 3. Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that my approach is flawed. Maybe because the expression is finite, not infinite. So, in the case of an infinite nested expression, it would converge to a certain value, but here, it's finite, so the approach doesn't work. Therefore, I can't use that method here. So, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or use the formula I derived earlier. Since I already computed it step by step and verified with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and we have 9 layers. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^n - 1)/(c - 1). In this case, c=3, d=1. So, a_n = 3^n * a_0 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe a_0 would be the initial term. Wait, let me see: Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the number of layers is 9, starting from a_1. So, if I consider a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, etc., up to a_9. So, in terms of the recurrence, n would go from 1 to 9. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be the term before a_1, which would be when n=0, but since our first term is a_1, perhaps a_0 is undefined or zero? Wait, maybe it's better to adjust the formula. Let me consider that a_1 = 4, and each a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. So, for k from 2 to 9, a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. Then, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_k^h = A*3^k. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution a_k^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for k = 9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59048)/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it all at once using the formula. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, we have a recurrence relation here: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Assuming L_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Plugging the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, let's equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. So, the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. That's reassuring because both methods gave me the same result. The first method was computing each layer step by step, which worked but was a bit tedious. The second method used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. In this case, since there are nine layers, it's manageable to compute step by step, but for more layers, the closed-form approach would be better.

The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L(1) = 4: L(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. But since each term also adds 1, it's a bit different, but the formula we derived earlier still applies. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, which gave me Layer 9 as 29524. 3. Multiply that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. 4. As a check, derived a general formula for the nth layer and confirmed that it matches the step-by-step computation. 5. Therefore, confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems feasible. Let me check if each layer's computation is accurate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3. As before, 29524 *3=88572. So I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check it another way. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's find the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, I can conclude that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find the steady-state solution, which is when a_n = a_{n-1} = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.

For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer using the formula to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364.

The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recursive pattern. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is of the form a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug this into the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substitute the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, set both sides equal: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recursive approach seems more straightforward. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is building up a geometric progression, but I think the recursive formula and the closed-form solution are more efficient here.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if there's a quicker way instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is generated by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form expression, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. But since the problem has nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step, but for a larger number of layers, the closed-form formula would be more efficient. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. 1. Recognize the nested structure and start from the innermost parentheses. 2. Compute each layer step by step, each time plugging the result into the next layer. 3. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Alternatively, use the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation to compute directly. Both methods lead to the same answer, 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3=40, etc. I notice that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. The general form is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is Ln = (3^(n) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 39 = 52? Wait, no, 1 + 3*13 is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try to express Ln in terms of L1. Since each step is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, starting from L1=4. Let me write out the first few terms: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, and L1=4. So, substituting into the general solution: L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4 L2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13 Let's set up the equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see, expanding the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)))))))) Wait, but that might not help much. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, and using the formula we derived, we can compute it directly. So, the key insight is recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression for it. That saves a lot of time instead of computing each layer manually, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. However, for a larger number of layers, the formula would be more efficient. Let me just confirm once again the calculations to be sure. Starting with L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my calculations.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I still get the same answer. That makes me more confident that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as repeatedly applying the operation 1 + 3*(previous result), which is similar to building a number in base 3 or something. But I think the methods I've used so far are sufficient. Just to make sure, let me compute each layer again, perhaps using a different approach.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation. In general, for such a recurrence, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, and let's assume the solution is Ln = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we need to find A using the initial condition. What's the initial condition? When n=1, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. This makes me confident that the solution is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. That's correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount how many layers there are. Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 3(...): Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So from the innermost, there are nine layers. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So the first parenthesis after the 3 is the start of the first layer. Then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that's nine layers. So from Layer 1 to Layer 9, which I computed correctly. So yes, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step built on the previous one correctly, and the multiplication at the end was accurate. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each layer is a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., as before. So, computing up to a_9 gives 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. But since I'm supposed to compute it step by step, I think the initial method is sufficient. Just to recap, I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer step by step until I reached the outermost expression, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. I also verified the result using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gave me the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's see: The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the first 1+3(...), each is a new layer. Let me count: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the inside out: 1+3 is layer 1, then 1+3(layer1) is layer 2, and so on until layer 9, which is the outermost. So, 9 layers in total. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers seems correct. So, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is defined by this relation. So, solving this recurrence might give me a closed-form expression, which could help verify the result. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Substitute L_n = A*3^n + B: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so: 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. This seems like a geometric sequence or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for Layer n in terms of n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p =1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1)=4. So, when n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me find D. Assume a_n = D. Then, substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n =3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is good. But since I'm just starting out, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. So, to recap, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, which gives me 88572, or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, which also gives me 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * C + d, where d is the steady-state value, found by setting L_n = L_{n-1} = d. So, d = 1 + 3*d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = 3^n * C - 1/2. To find C, we can use the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = 3^1 * C - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the innermost layer, but actually, wait, the innermost layer is L_1, then L_2, up to L_9. So the outermost expression is 3*(L_9). Wait, no, actually, let me think. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the innermost is 1+3. So, the outermost is 3*(L_9). But according to our earlier calculation, L_9 = 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, the key was recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula. But even without that, computing each layer step by step works, albeit being more time-consuming. Either way, the answer comes out to 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern in the nested expressions.

Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here, which would save me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, the value would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. But since I already did the step-by-step, it's good to cross-verify using the formula. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer manually to ensure that my recursive approach is correct. Let's take layer 4: a_4 should be 121. From the earlier computation, a_3 was 40, so a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Using the closed-form formula, a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364, which also matches. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I can be confident that a_9 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me check one more time. Maybe I can compute it in a different way or look for a pattern. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1) So, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, with n=9, f(9)=29524, then the total expression is 3*f(9)=88572. Alternatively, I might consider solving the recurrence relation. Let's see: The recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B. Let's find A and B. When n=1: f(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, the recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Plugging into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, from f(1) = 3A + B = 4, and B=-1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's exactly what I got before. So, then the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's see: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I feel pretty sure about this result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the closed-form formula both give the same result. So, yeah, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. So, we can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could compute 3*(L_9) using the formula. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. If I denote the entire inner expression as x, then x = 1 + 3x, but wait, that's only if the nesting continues infinitely. In our case, the nesting stops after nine layers, so it's a finite geometric series. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, starting from 1. So, the innermost term is 1, then 1*3, then 1*3^2, up to 1*3^8, since there are nine layers. Wait, let me think again. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3, so the total expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3 times the previous. So, the number of terms is nine, but the exponents would be from 3^0 up to 3^8. Let me try to model this. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, expanding it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))). Each time, we're adding another 1 + 3*... So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I consider the layers as a sequence, each term is 1 + 3*previous. As we saw earlier, this leads to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for nine layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, then multiplied by 3, giving 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same answer as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. I've checked it using two different methods: step-by-step computation of each layer, and using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. Additionally, modeling it as a finite geometric series also gives the same answer. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit time-consuming, especially with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped a lot. I just need to be careful with the arithmetic to ensure I don't make any calculation errors, especially when dealing with large numbers. But since I double-checked each step, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, seems consistent. Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that matches. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, multiplying each time by 3 and adding 1, and then finally multiplying the last result by 3, I arrive at 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses inside the main 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this is a geometric series or something. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, so the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 3 times the previous minus 2? Let me check: a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1? Wait, 3*4 +1=13, yes. Similarly, a_3=3*13 +1=40, yes. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the final value is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. I think I'm done here.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the nesting isn't too deep (only nine layers), computing each step manually is feasible. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good approach. It's always reassuring to cross-verify using different methods. So, to summarize: The expression is a nested multiplication with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost, I found that the innermost layer is 4, each subsequent layer grows exponentially, and after nine layers, the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After nine layers, the value is 29524.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). How many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me count: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds a 1+3*(...). So how many times does this happen? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so the total number of layers is 9. Because from the innermost to the outermost, each time you have a 1+3(...). So that's 9 layers. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Therefore, the final computation is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm this result. Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, that's a recurrence relation. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did before. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me find D. Assuming a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I found earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} = 59049, then (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to see if I can express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are 9 layers, perhaps the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which might relate to a geometric series. Let me think. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But in this case, the inner expression is similar to E, but actually, each layer is similar but not exactly E because E is 3*(...). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, considering the layers, each a_n is built from the previous one, so using the formula I found earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I were to compute each layer manually without the formula, I could also reach the same result, but it would take more time and there's a higher chance of making an arithmetic error. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it seems more efficient. Let me just verify the arithmetic for each layer once more to be thorough. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers compute correctly. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me define L(n) where n is the layer number. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L(1) = 4, so 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n approaching infinity, but since it's finite, maybe we can use another equation. Alternatively, since it's a linear recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. Let me try to unroll the recurrence. L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, L(n) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L(n-2)) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L(n-2). Continuing this way, after n steps, we get L(n) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L(0). But in our case, L(1) = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, maybe L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the general formula is L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if each layer follows a certain formula. Looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n\nWait, I notice that each layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, if I let L1 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524.\n\nNow, since there are 9 layers, and the outermost term is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The general form is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be based on the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, then L1=(3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2, L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula is Ln=(3^(n+1)-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9=(3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost term is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me see. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...))) with 9 layers. So, if we let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 9 layers. Wait, but each layer adds another 3. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. But in this case, each term is 1 + 3*next term, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Wait, but let's think recursively. Let me denote S(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, S(2)=1 + 3*4=13, S(3)=1 +3*13=40, etc., as before. So, S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1)=4. We've already found that S(n) = (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Therefore, S(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*S(9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be seen as 3*(S(9)), where S(9) is as above. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the initial layer-by-layer computation.

So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, so each layer is 3^n + something. But perhaps the formula approach is more efficient. Since each layer follows S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), and S(1)=4, then S(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, as we found. So, S(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here where each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. Let me check if I can find a formula for this. It seems like each layer n is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is a(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1). If we assume a(n) = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, from the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that confirms my earlier calculation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or perhaps find a pattern or formula to compute it without calculating each layer manually, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. In general, for such a recurrence relation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 satisfies this. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, not 1. So that formula doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we had a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula directly. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes: 1. Identified that the expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). 2. Computed each layer step by step from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9). 3. Found that Layer 9 is 29524. 4. Multiplied by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. 5. Verified using a recurrence relation formula, which also gave the same result. So I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again, just to be thorough. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Next layer:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Next:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Next:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Next:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Next:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Next:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.
