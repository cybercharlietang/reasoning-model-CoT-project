    "text": " Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, let's see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. Then, finding a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Let's assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Then, substituting into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L(9)) = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we find a general formula for each layer, confirming that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, starting from a_1 as 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the answer is the same. I think I've got it right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers compute correctly. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Yep, that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So yes, layer 1 to layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, I think my computation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a particular solution is a constant D. Then, substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building up a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the total sum can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see if I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. So, expanding it out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see how many terms there are. Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds another term. But perhaps it's better to model the total expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see the pattern. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. But since each layer is similar, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself, but that might not be straightforward because the depth is fixed at 9 layers. Alternatively, since we already have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is a_9, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or model it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n=1, each layer is 1 + 3n. So, if I denote L_k as the value at layer k, then L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^k + B = 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^k + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^k + B = A*3^k + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^k from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When k=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote L1 as the innermost, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for Ln. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L. Plugging into the recurrence: L = 1 + 3*L => L = 1 + 3L => L - 3L = 1 => -2L = 1 => L = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I found each subsequent layer's value. Then, recognizing the pattern, I derived a general formula using recurrence relations, which confirmed that Layer 9 is 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer of 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since I already found the closed-form using recurrence relations, I think that's sufficient. So, the step-by-step computation is as follows: Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Compute each layer up to the 9th, then multiply by 3. The result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, each layer is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's see: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each layer is following the pattern: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, Ln=4. Plugging in: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, Layer 9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Let me denote the innermost term as x. Then each layer is 1 + 3x, and so on. But since it's nested nine times, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, since each layer is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, and we've already solved it with the recurrence relation, I think the step-by-step approach was correct.

Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the formula approach confirms the step-by-step calculation.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which would be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost, we have Layer 1 up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, then L_2 is 1 + 3*L_1, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let's plug in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, L_n = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, set equal to A*3^{n} + B:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which resembles a geometric series but nested. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers of parentheses, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors this time, as I double-checked each multiplication.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation here: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This seems solid. So, I think the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me check the calculations once more. Compute each layer again using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Correct.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but hold on: when n=1, a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, if I expand the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding it step by step. Let me denote the innermost part as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*4 =13. Then, 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, as before. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*previous. So, the total number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum. Let me see: If I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), it's similar to 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Wait, that seems like it could be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try writing it out.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me see how many times 3 is multiplied. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3, except the innermost which is just 1+3. So, maybe E can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to see the pattern.\n\nLet me think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to express E in terms of itself. Wait, but in this case, the inner expression is similar but not identical to E. Because E is 3*(...), and the inner expression is 1 + 3*(...). Hmm, maybe not directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But this seems recursive. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that each layer adds a term of 3^k. Let me try to expand E step by step.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand this step by step:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 + 3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 + 3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just confirm the exponent in the formula. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and n=9, so 3^{10} is correct. 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are nine such layers. So, starting from 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), and so on, nine times. So, yes, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, the computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me compute Layer 9 again to be sure.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for L_n? Let's try to find a general formula. Suppose we have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we computed. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. But in this case, since each term is defined recursively, the formula we derived using the recurrence relation is more straightforward. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A and C are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*C = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*C So, we have: A*3^{n} + C = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*C Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: C = 1 + 3*C Subtract 3*C from both sides: -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a linear function.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, layer n=9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial computation. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There's 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, layers 1 through 9, with layer 9 being the outermost. So, yes, L_9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply by 3. So, all right, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute L_9 again using the formula. L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using another approach, like expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. Let me try that as a check. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39=40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nNext: 1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572.\n\nYes, same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But in this case, it's a finite series, so the formula I used earlier applies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum. Let me try to write out the expression fully expanded. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3 +9.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27.\n\nWait, this seems like each layer adds another term of 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but no, because each layer is 1 +3*(previous sum), so it's not exactly a sum of 3^k terms, but perhaps it's similar.\n\nWait, if I think of each layer as L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, then L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, expanding, L_n =1 +3*(1 +3*L_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*L_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, L_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n-1} +3^n * L_1.\n\nWait, but L_1 is 4, which is 1 +3.\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of L_n as a sum of a geometric series plus something else.\n\nWait, from the formula I derived earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*L_9=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, such as recognizing the pattern as a repeated multiplication and addition, leading to a formula.\n\nWait, another approach: Each time you have 1 +3*(...), so if I denote S as the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses, then S=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). But in this case, it's finite, so S is built up from the innermost parentheses.\n\nWait, but in our problem, it's not an infinite series, but a finite one with nine layers. So, perhaps the formula I used is the most straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the value using the formula for a finite geometric series.\n\nWait, let me see: Each layer is 1 +3*previous layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1.\n\nWait, but in any case, I think the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 29524 *3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a formula, and checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence relation. First, plug in n=1: L_1 = 3*A + B = 4. Then, using the recurrence, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, from the initial condition: 3*A + B = 4. Substitute B = -1/2: 3*A - 1/2 = 4 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier calculations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Since there are nine layers, n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we can compute each layer step by step or derive a closed-form solution. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see. Each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1 = 4, each subsequent layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The layers go up to n=9, so L_9 is the value of the innermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, 3*L_9 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and see if that forms a geometric series when expanded. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand E step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me define E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 E_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 E_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, E = 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result as before. Therefore, I think the answer is correct. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result. 3. Notice a pattern and derive a formula using the recurrence relation. 4. Verify the formula with known values and apply it to find L_9. 5. Multiply L_9 by 3 to get the final result. 6. Cross-check all computations to ensure accuracy. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from 1, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in my layers, a_1 was 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps the general term is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But in my case, a_1 was 4. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Wait, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier computation. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this without computing each layer, but since I was able to get the answer by computing each layer and also by using the recurrence relation, I feel confident that the answer is correct. Just to be thorough, let me try computing a few more layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Wait, I already did 9 layers, but let me check a couple more. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is computed as such. Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something else. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*a_9 = 88572.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we can solve these equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract (1) from (2): 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A into (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), maybe it's easier to compute each term as I did before. Alternatively, I can look for a pattern or a closed-form formula. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see if we can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This seems similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an additional 1 each time. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this, so 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. That's 9 layers, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Compute each layer from the inside out:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me think about it. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to represent this as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as S. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, which is similar to what I did before. But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(S_9), where S_9 is the 9th layer. So, using the formula I found, S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, S_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*S_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure. Let me try. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E =3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +...))) with nine layers. Let me try to expand it step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is a multiple of 3^n. Wait, from the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. So, E=3*a_9=88572. Therefore, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches Layer 2. Similarly, n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. So, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. The solution is a_n = c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, but wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see if this sequence follows a pattern. Let me list the values again:\n\nn: 1, L_n: 4\nn: 2, L_n: 13\nn: 3, L_n: 40\nn: 4, L_n: 121\nn: 5, L_n: 364\nn: 6, L_n: 1093\nn: 7, L_n: 3280\nn: 8, L_n: 9841\nn: 9, L_n: 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, they seem familiar. Wait, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. These look like they might be related to powers of 3. Let me check:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nHmm, not quite matching. Let me see if L_n can be expressed in terms of 3^n. Let me compute 3^n - 2:\n\nn=1: 3^1 - 2 = 1, but L_1=4, so no.\nn=2: 9 - 2 =7, L_2=13, no.\nn=3: 27 - 2=25, L_3=40, no.\n\nWait, maybe 3^(n+1) - something. Let's try:\n\nn=1: 3^2 - 5 = 9 -5=4. Oh, that's L_1=4.\n\nn=2: 3^3 - 26=27 -26=1, which is not L_2=13. Hmm, not quite.\n\nWait, maybe L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check:\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches L_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches L_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches L_3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=121, which matches L_4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=364, which matches L_5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=1093, which matches L_6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=3280, which matches L_7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=9841, which matches L_8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=29524, which matches L_9=29524.\n\nWow, so it seems that L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. That's a neat formula. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, then 3 * L_n = 3*(3^(n+1) - 1)/2 = (3^(n+2) - 3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, it would be (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which confirms the result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations because both methods led me to the same result, and I double-checked each step along the way. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but recognizing the pattern and deriving the formula made it much easier and quicker.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, what's the initial condition? When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} directly and use the formula. But since I already have the answer, maybe that's sufficient. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we can compute each step systematically. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows us to find a closed-form solution, confirming that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it without calculating each layer manually. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1, because a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so a_0 = (a_1 -1)/3 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So, using n=0: a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) A + B = 1 Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1: (3A + B) - (A + B) = 4 - 1 => 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from equation 2: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is indeed a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if n is large. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, that can be written as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me check. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*k^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the equation: C = k*C + c => C - kC = c => C(1 - k) = c => C = c/(1 - k). So, the general solution is a_n = A*k^{n} + c/(1 - k). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can solve for A. So, a_1 = A*k^{1} + c/(1 - k) = A*k + c/(1 - k) = 4. In our case, k=3, c=1. So, a_n = A*3^{n} + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Using a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, you're adding 1 and then tripling the previous amount. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, after 9 layers, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} to see if that gives the same result. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly. The entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 3^{11}-3=177147-3=177144. Then, divide by 2:177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me recompute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=3*59049=177147. Correct. Then, 177147 -3=177144. 177144 divided by 2 is indeed 88572. So, yes, the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, where L_1 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_1 = 4, and the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me write down the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so it's similar to a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) But that seems too vague. Alternatively, let me think recursively. Let\u2019s define E_n as the expression with n layers. Then, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}). So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Wait, no, E_1 would be the innermost layer, which is 3*(1 + 3)=12. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then multiplied by 3 in the next layer. So perhaps E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), where E_1=3*(1 +3)=12. But in our problem, the innermost is 1 + 3=4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(13)=39. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the earlier approach where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4. So, regardless, using the formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, we can compute Layer 9 as 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we can determine the value of each layer using the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we find that each layer n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute it without doing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.
