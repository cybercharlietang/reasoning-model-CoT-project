    "text": " Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst digit (units place): 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, so maybe there are 9 layers, each with 1+3(...). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to Layer 9 as 29524. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" before the innermost \"1+3\". Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a \"1+3(\" until the outermost. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's parse it:\n\nThe outermost is 3*(...), and inside that is 1 + 3*(...). Each time we have a \"1+3(\" inside, which adds a layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me write it as layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, my earlier calculation of 9 layers is correct, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications or additions.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left.\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with another method. Maybe using another approach to compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3 can be broken down as:\n\n(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers, let me recount the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" expressions. Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nInnermost: 1+3\n\nThen, each \"1+3(\" outside adds a layer. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\", each subsequent \"1+3(\" is nested inside. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times \"1+3(\" before the innermost \"1+3\". So, that would mean 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 9 layers, each computed as I did earlier.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute the expression using a different approach, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88,572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can directly compute it as (3^{11} -3)/2=88,572.\n\nThis gives me even more confidence that the result is correct.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step, verifying each computation, and then using a formula to find the closed-form solution, I arrive at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer's computation because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, I think that's correct. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers? Wait, let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs: Starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, in the original expression, I can see that there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", which would mean 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went up to Layer 9, which is correct because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, 9 layers in total, each computed correctly. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. I remember that expressions like this sometimes form a geometric series or follow a pattern that can be represented recursively. Let me see if that's the case here. Let's define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by that recursive formula. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems to be exactly what I computed earlier. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. If I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might help me compute the 9th term more quickly. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this double-checking using the recursive formula and the closed-form solution solidifies that the answer is correct. So, the step-by-step process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation. 3. Identify the pattern as a linear recurrence relation. 4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. 5. Use the closed-form expression to compute the 9th term efficiently. 6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. Each step confirmed the previous result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems consistent. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, both by direct computation and by using the recurrence relation formula. It seems solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*Layer 8, which was 1 + 3*9841. Let me confirm 3*9841: 9841*3. Let's compute that: 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; +120 = 29,520; +3 = 29,523. So 3*9841=29,523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; +1,500 = 88,500; +60 = 88,560; +12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me see if that's the case. Let me think about the general term. Let's say each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524=88,572. So, using the closed-form expression, I can see that each layer follows a pattern where a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29,524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the pattern holds true with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have allowed me to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, setting equal to left-hand side: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads me to the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to exponential growth, but calculating each step manually seems tedious but doable, as I did earlier. Either way, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula.

Wait, let me test that.\n\nWait, for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but our a1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let's try to compute a few terms and see if we can find a pattern.\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, if I look at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I can compute this using the formula instead of computing each layer. Since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that:\n\n3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524.

But let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recursive formula is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Wait, no, actually Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form: Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test that. Let me assume that Layer n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but all our layers have been integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe I can write the recurrence as Layer n = 3*Layer n-1 + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Layer n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. I notice that each a_n can be expressed recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let's find d. Assume a particular solution is a constant d. Then, substituting into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3*(a_9) using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0 - d/(c-1)) + d/(c-1). Wait, let me make sure.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Hmm, no, actually, in this case, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. But since the layers are nested, it's more efficient to use the recurrence relation approach as I did above.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n----------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so tens digit is 7, carryover 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, so hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so thousands digit is 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, so ten-thousands digit is 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems consistent. Let me just check a couple of layers again to be sure. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 is 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. It looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which in this case, a=1 and b=3. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (a/(1 - b)) + b^n * C, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but since b \u2260 1, we can solve it as L_n = (a/(1 - b)) + C*b^n. Let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be L_n^p = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = -1/2 + C*3^n. Using the initial condition, when n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = -1/2 + C*3^1. Thus, 4 = -1/2 + 3C. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches L_3=40. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar term)}\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I feel like that might not be the case because sometimes with these nested expressions, there's a formula or a pattern that can be applied to compute it more efficiently without calculating each layer step by step. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to generalize this.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4, as computed earlier.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can solve it using the method for solving such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in our case, a = 3 and b = 1. So, the homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Hmm, let's test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^{4})/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which is the same as before. So, that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.

    "text": " Wait, let me verify that. Let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524 to see if it equals 88572. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back and verify each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, each step checks out. I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a formula, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for it, but since I already computed each layer step by step, perhaps that's sufficient. But just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern here. Let me list the layers and their values:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can express Layer n in terms of n. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nn: 1, value:4\n\nn:2,13\n\nn:3,40\n\nn:4,121\n\nn:5,364\n\nn:6,1093\n\nn:7,3280\n\nn:8,9841\n\nn:9,29524\n\nHmm, let's see if these numbers follow a specific sequence. Let me check the ratio between successive terms.\n\n13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n40 /13 \u2248 3.0769\n\n121 /40 \u2248 3.025\n\n364 /121 \u2248 3.008\n\n1093 /364 \u2248 3.000\n\n3280 /1093 \u2248 3.000\n\n9841 /3280 \u2248 3.000\n\n29524 /9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nSo, starting from Layer 5 onwards, each layer is approximately 3 times the previous layer. That makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). As the previous layer grows large, the 1 becomes negligible, and the term approaches 3 times the previous layer. So, the ratio approaches 3 as n increases. So, for large n, Layer n \u2248 3^n, but with some adjustment for the initial terms. But in this case, since we have a specific number of layers, 9, and we computed each step, perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation. Alternatively, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 4 and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. Then, we can find a formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I did it both by step-by-step computation and by finding a formula for the nth term, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps again because the numbers are getting quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 (as calculated above) So, yes, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So when I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time I was computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). But wait, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), so perhaps I should check if I've accounted for all layers correctly. Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) operation. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems quite a large number, but given the nesting, it's plausible. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) * b, where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me define L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, etc., up to L_9. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But in our case, the recurrence starts at L_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. So, let's see. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's a good check. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer. Let me try that. Since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, using the closed-form formula gives me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each calculation to avoid mistakes. 3. After computing up to Layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to compute the result directly, which also gave the same answer. This double-checking process helps ensure that the answer is correct. I think I've covered all the steps thoroughly and didn't make any calculation errors this time, so I'm confident in the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous layer})\\).

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer because there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that the expression is correctly evaluated. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a_1. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did before. Now, the problem is to compute 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to derive it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the expression inside is a_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression is 3*a_n where n=9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} =177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the answer, using the closed-form formula. But since I was able to compute it step by step as well, it reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write a small program or use a calculator to compute this, I could verify it, but since I've double-checked each step manually and also derived a closed-form formula that gives the same result, I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's all the steps I can think of. I've broken down the problem, computed each layer step by step, checked using a closed-form formula, and even rechecked the final multiplication. Everything seems to add up correctly. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = r*a_{n-1}, which has solution a_n = a_0*r^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the equation: K = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying initial condition a_0 = initial value. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's model it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Wait, but let me check: when n=1, a_1=4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but that might complicate things more. The step-by-step approach seems solid.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using both methods to see if they align. For example, let's compute a_2 using both methods.\n\nUsing the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that a_9 = 29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used two different methods (direct computation and recurrence relation), and both lead to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier layers. Sometimes, when you have nested expressions, a small error can propagate and mess up the entire result. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. 3*3280: 3280 * 3. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers seem to compute correctly. Therefore, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also find another condition. As n approaches infinity, if the recurrence continues, but since we have a finite number of layers, maybe it's better to compute it step by step. But perhaps using the recurrence formula can help us find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case we need to compute it for more layers or in a different context.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the expansion would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But in this case, since each layer is nested, it's a bit different, but the formula we derived earlier still applies.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step or using the derived formula, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that, ultimately leading to the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked each step and even found a formula to generalize the solution. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Using the derived formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\), we determine the value of the ninth layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous expression})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Using the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\) for the nth layer:\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this more efficiently, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if we use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to use a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without doing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula. Let's see, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, that's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.

So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the method for solving linear recurrences. In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to write it out: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I expand this, each innermost term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3 times the previous term. So, expanding all the way, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see if I can express E in terms of itself. Wait, but E is the entire expression, so it's 3 times (1 + 3 times something). Let me see: Let me define E as 3*(1 + 3*F), where F is the next layer. But F itself is similar to E but with one fewer layer. Since there are nine layers, F would be 3*(1 + 3*G), where G is the next layer, and so on, until the innermost layer which is 1 + 3*1 = 4. Alternatively, maybe I can think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. But that might not directly help. Alternatively, using the formula we found earlier, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and here n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, then E=3*a_9=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach. Let's see: Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(...), which can be thought of as 1 + 3*previous_term. So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*previous. So, as we computed earlier, each layer is 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. I think I've checked this multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation formula, and verifying each step. All methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each term step by step. Using the recurrence relation formula, we find that the innermost term evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost term being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me check again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, so 5 with carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 8852? Wait, no, wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplied by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 *3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 *3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step through each layer to see if I made any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems feasible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers. Let's list the results of each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a pattern or a recursive formula. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. In general, for such a recurrence, we can model it as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers computed:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer is n=1, and the outermost is n=9. So the value at layer 9 is (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrived at the same answer, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer computation and the formula using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution for a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the equation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost layer (layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. The outermost layer (layer 9) results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L(n) as the value of layer n, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for L(n). The recurrence relation is: L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L(9)) = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me try to see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to E = 3*(1 + E/3). Wait, is that correct? Let me see. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(inner expression). So, if I have multiple layers, maybe the entire expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Wait, let me think again. If I have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n-1 layers. So, E = 3*(1 + E/3). Wait, that might be a way to represent it. Let me set up the equation: E = 3*(1 + (E)/3). Wait, is that right? Because each inner expression is similar to E, but scaled down by a factor. Let me check with n=1: If n=1, E = 3*(1) =3. But according to the formula, E=3*(1 + E/3). Let's see: E=3*(1 + E/3) => E=3 + E => 0=3, which is impossible. So, that approach might not be correct. Maybe I need to adjust the equation. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the layers as a sum. Each layer adds another term in a geometric series. Let me try to see. From the closed-form solution earlier, L(n) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 =59049/2 -1/2=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of E as the sum of a geometric series. Let me try that. Each time, we have a term that's 3^k, starting from k=1 up to k=10. Wait, let's see. The expression E is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me expand it step by step. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me try to write this as E = 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). Wait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe I can express E as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^{10} or something like that. Wait, let me think. From the layers, each layer adds a term that's 3 times the previous. So, maybe the total is 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^{10} - something. Wait, let me compute the sum of a geometric series. The sum S = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in our case, the layers are building up as L(n) =1 +3*L(n-1). So, each L(n) is 1 +3*L(n-1). So, if I have L(1)=4, L(2)=13, L(3)=40, etc., as before. But when I multiply by 3 at the end, I get E=3*L(9)=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) which is similar to E =3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... up to some terms. Wait, let me try to expand E fully. E =3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand the innermost first: The innermost is 1+3=4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*previous. So, as I computed earlier, each layer is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see E as a sum of 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, let's see: Each time, we're adding another layer, so perhaps E can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*1))) with 9 threes. Wait, that might not be the exact breakdown, but let me think. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps E=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) =3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... +3*3^9. Wait, that would be E=3 +3^2 +3^3 + ... +3^{10}. Let me compute that sum. The sum S =3 +3^2 +3^3 + ... +3^{10}. This is a geometric series with first term a=3, ratio r=3, number of terms n=10. The sum S =a*(r^{n} -1)/(r-1) =3*(3^{10} -1)/(3-1)=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Wait, that's exactly the same result as before! So, E=88572. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the closed-form solution for the recurrence, or recognize the sum as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. 3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer. 4. Alternatively, recognize the pattern as a geometric series and compute the sum directly. Both methods led to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that's correct. I think I've thought through this thoroughly and checked my work multiple times. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(inner expression)}\\).

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check that because 3*(Layer 8) where Layer 8 was 9841. So 3*9841 is indeed 29523, right? Wait, no, 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524. So that's correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have made a mistake.

Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the innermost part, but each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So the total expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I should verify my calculations by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.

Correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute each layer as I did before:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients, but since it's nonhomogeneous (because of the constant term 1), I might need to find a particular solution and the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. So, I think I've done this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if that applies here. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_{n+1} = k*a_n + c, where k is the coefficient (here, 3) and c is the constant (here, 1). The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula: a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1)) * (k)^{n - 1} - (c)/(k - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_{n+1} = k*a_n + c. The general solution is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1)) * k^{n - 1} - (c)/(k - 1). Let me plug in the values here: a_1 = 4, k = 3, c = 1. So, the formula would be a_n = (4 + (1)/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n - 1} - (1)/(3 - 1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n - 1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n - 1} - 1/2. Simplifying that: (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then let's test it with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the Layer 9 value is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) by recognizing it as a geometric series, but since each term is nested, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula. Either way, the result is the same. So, after computing each layer and verifying with the recurrence formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572.

Wait, but let me just check one more time, perhaps with a different approach to make sure. Maybe using a different method for each layer or seeing if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Hmm, this expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, the value at layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to see if I can get the same result. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute a_1 using this formula:\n\na_1 = (3^{1+1} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've got this right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the closed-form formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n is 9 because there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight layers inside because each opening parenthesis is followed by another layer. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of '1+3(...)' parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Each '1+3' is inside another '1+3(...)'. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that. Let me see how many opening parentheses there are after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of '1+3(' sequences. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), and each subsequent (1+3(...) is nested inside. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each '1+3(' is a new layer. So, starting from the first '1+3(', that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent '1+3(' is another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3))\n\nWait, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating. The number of layers is equal to the number of times '1+3(' appears. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's nine layers, each computed step by step. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. So, a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the final answer is 3*a_9. So, in general, for n layers, the value would be 3*a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =4. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2= 9/2. So, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula. That's pretty neat. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer, I computed each layer step by step, which gave me 29524 for the innermost expression, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Next, 5 * 3 = 15, so hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1. Next, 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so thousands digit is 8, carryover 2. Next, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, so ten-thousands digit is 8. So the result is 88572.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution would be a_n = A*r^n, and a particular solution would be a constant if r \u2260 1. Let me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9 in the formula, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, +524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the problem is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually might be the simplest approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me consider that. Suppose we have an expression like a + 3(a + 3(a + 3(...))) with n layers. It might form a geometric progression. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on. So in general, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = A*3^{k}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_k^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is k=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since the problem only had nine layers, both methods work. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. The innermost is (1+3), which is one layer.

Let me write it out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer.

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D.\n\nSolving for D: D = 1 + 3D \u21d2 0 = 1 + 2D \u21d2 D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me verify it with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Thus, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed earlier.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nBut perhaps more straightforwardly, since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have a closed-form solution, it's easier to use that formula.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another approach, like expanding each layer step by step, but using a different notation or method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer using a table to keep track of the values:\n\nLayer | Value\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute each layer using a different method, like using exponents, since each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^1) + 1.\n\nWait, no, 3^1 is 3, plus 1 is 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Alternatively, 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10, which is not 13. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nWait, from the recurrence, we saw that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThus, using this formula, we can compute any layer quickly without having to compute each step. So, that's a more efficient method, especially if there were more layers.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So writing it down from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So the number is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524 to verify. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again just to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did before. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the innermost layer, but wait, actually, the way I defined a_n, a_1 is the innermost layer, so a_9 would be the outermost before multiplying by 3. Wait, no, let me think again. The innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9=29524. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me see if each layer follows a geometric progression or something similar. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 4 Layer 2: 13 = 4*3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 13*3 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 40*3 + 1 Layer 5: 364 = 121*3 + 1 Layer 6: 1093 = 364*3 + 1 Layer 7: 3280 = 1093*3 + 1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3280*3 + 1 Layer 9: 29524 = 9841*3 + 1 So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, if I denote L1 = 4, then L2 = 3*L1 + 1, L3 = 3*L2 + 1, and so on, up to L9. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3Ln-1 = 1. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the equation: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with Layer 1: n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be n=9: (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern when multiplying by 3 each time. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*something). If I expand this, it might form a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression. Let's denote E as the entire expression: E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand E step by step: E = 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) Wait, but that seems like it's going back to the same structure. Maybe another approach is needed. Alternatively, since each layer is a recurrence relation, and we've already solved for Layer 9, maybe that's the most straightforward way. So, I think the answer is 88572. To make sure, I can check the calculations once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using a formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. The innermost layer is Layer 1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Solving the recurrence, we find that each layer \\( L_n \\) can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go back through each layer computation to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each time we're doing 1 + 3*(previous). Let's see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive sequence. Let me define a_n as the value at each layer, starting from a_1=4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1, so a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. Then, the layers go up to a_9, since we have nine layers. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form solution, I also get 88572. Therefore, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. So, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me see if I can compute this another way. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something else. Alternatively, notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, each time, it's like each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, starting from 4, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the expression as a nested multiplication, maybe I can represent it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote each nested expression as E_n, where E_1=1+3, E_2=1+3E_1, and so on, up to E_9=1+3E_8. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9. So, E_1=4, E_2=1+3*4=13, E_3=1+3*13=40, etc., as before. So, yes, this approach is consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum involving powers of 3. Let me see. Let's try to expand E_9: E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 =1 +3*(1 +3*E_7)=1 +3*1 +3^2*E_7=1 +3 +3^2*E_7. Continuing this way, E_9=1 +3 +3^2*E_7. But E_7=1 +3*E_6=1 +3*(1 +3*E_5)=1 +3 +3^2*E_5. So, substituting back, E_9=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3 +3^2*E_5). Hmm, this seems like it's getting more complex, but maybe I can see a pattern here. Each E_n can be written as a sum of 3^k terms plus a term involving E_{n-1}. Wait, perhaps I can express E_n as the sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k multiplied by something. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for E_n. Wait, from the earlier computation, we saw that E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, E_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. So, then 3*E_9=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^10 -1 over 2, multiplied by 3. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it. So, that's another confirmation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the geometric series and the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. So, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my computations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1.

Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
