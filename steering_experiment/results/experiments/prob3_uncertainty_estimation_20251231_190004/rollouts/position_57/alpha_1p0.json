Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Did I compute all the layers correctly? Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, all layers seem correctly computed. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the multiplication because sometimes when I do it quickly, I might make a mistake.\n\nCalculating 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to verify. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )) with how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1+3( adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen each layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3 times the 9th layer, right? Because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and the outermost is the 9th one. So, I think I counted 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n, which might help verify my result.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n = 5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n = 6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n = 7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n = 8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n = 9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, using this formula, I can compute L_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure there are no mistakes. So, I'm confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence relation seems more straightforward. However, just for thoroughness, let me see if I can relate it to a geometric series.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand it, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Expanding this, it's similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But wait, in our case, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so it's a bit different.\n\nWait, perhaps if I expand the entire expression, it's a finite geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term of 3^{n} where n increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series with ratio 3 and n+1 terms. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{k} - 1)/(r - 1), where k is the number of terms.\n\nIn our case, L_n would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it. Each layer L_n is the sum of a geometric series with n+1 terms, starting from 3^0=1 up to 3^n.\n\nTherefore, for L_9, it's the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nThis further confirms the correctness of the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to see if it's indeed 59049.\n\nCalculating 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, correct. So, (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nOne last thing I might consider is whether there's a pattern or formula that can be generalized for such expressions. As I saw earlier, recognizing the recurrence relation or the geometric series helps in solving it more efficiently, especially if the number of layers is large. In this case, with nine layers, it's manageable step-by-step, but for more layers, a general formula would be more practical.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step-by-step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time.\n\n3. Verify using a recurrence relation and a geometric series approach.\n\n4. Confirm the final result by multiple methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and applying different mathematical concepts to verify the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step-by-step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. The recurrence relation for each layer is \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\), starting with \\(L_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) is the sum of a geometric series, leading to the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, \\(L_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another nested term)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me count the number of times the expression repeats. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so the innermost is layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer8), and so on.\n\nBut in my earlier computation, I went up to layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the layers are correctly numbered. If I have 9 layers, then each layer from 1 to 9 is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting with layer1=4, layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the innermost is layer1:1+3, then layer2:1+3*(layer1), up to layer9:1+3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, my earlier computation seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions, which could save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a particular method, either approach is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows for a closed-form solution, confirming the result efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer would be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the 9th term, we have n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^5 is 243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 is 59,049, subtract 1 is 59,048, divided by 2 is 29,524. So, a_9 is 29,524, then multiplied by 3 is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula without computing each layer, but since I've already verified it with both methods, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. After computing up to the 9th layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n4. Alternatively, model the problem using a recurrence relation and solve it to find a closed-form expression, then compute the 9th term and multiply by 3.\n\nBoth methods led to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing up to the 9th layer, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", let's compute it step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm each step because it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly. Let me go back through each layer to check for any calculation errors. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, all layers are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that there are only nine layers, computing each step by hand seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to recall a formula, especially since I might misremember it. So, step-by-step computation is probably the safest approach here. Another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 * something, but maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since it's straightforward and only nine terms. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a sum. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))) with nine layers. If I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))) which, when fully expanded, would result in a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see if that's the case. Each time we have 3 multiplied by a term that includes 1 plus 3 times another term. So, if I keep expanding, the entire expression would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms, but wait, actually, the number of terms might be different because each layer adds another multiplication. Wait, let me think about it again. The innermost term is 1 +3, which is 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3*previous +1. So, when I expand all the layers, I might end up with a sum that looks like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4 ...))). So, each layer adds another 3^n term. Alternatively, maybe the total sum is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Wait, let me check that. The general form for such a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*previous is that the nth term is (3^{n} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it would be (3^9 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^9 is 19683. So, (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, that's exactly what I got for Layer 8. Wait, no, Layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, as a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct, as a_3=40. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I did it step by step, checked each layer, then used a formula approach to confirm. So, confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times another similar term. The innermost term is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around this pattern.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88752. But when I added it as 20000+9000+500+20+4, I got 88572. So there's a discrepancy here. I must have messed up the digit positions. Let me write it correctly. The number is 29524, which is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. But that would be 88752. However, when I added the individual components, I got 88572. Wait, that can't be right.

The digit-by-digit method gave me 88752, but the addition method gave me 88572. There's a mistake somewhere.

Wait, how did I get 88752 earlier? I think I misplaced the digits when writing them down. Let me see: The digits are 2 (units),7 (tens),5 (hundreds),8 (thousands),8 (ten thousands). So, the number is 88,572, not 88,752. So the correct multiplication is 88,572. I must have transposed the digits earlier. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by another method. Maybe using another approach. Let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we've computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then 3*29,524 should be 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer computation to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting over, computing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit, I thought it was 88752, but that was a mistake. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find B, set a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B -3B =1 \u21d2 -2B=1 \u21d2 B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A -1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation, and it confirms that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the problem was to compute that nested expression, and by breaking it down layer by layer and recognizing the pattern, I arrived at the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Recognizing this pattern allows us to use a recurrence relation to find the value of the innermost expression, which is then used to compute each subsequent layer. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Because Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers seem to compute correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nLet's take a smaller version with fewer layers. For example, suppose the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, expanding step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nMultiply by 3: 120.\n\nSo that works. Now, let's try with two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nMultiply by 3: 39.\n\nWhich is correct because 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39.\n\nSo, the approach seems solid. Therefore, my calculation for the original problem should be correct.\n\nHence, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So I think I made a mistake earlier when I wrote down the digits. I think the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0.\n\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0.\n\nSo the digits are 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So that's 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers before that. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error there.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13.

Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, after computing Layer9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L1, then:\n\nL1 =1 +3=4\n\nL2=1 +3*L1=1+12=13\n\nL3=1 +3*L2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can see that each L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)}=C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK =1 +3*K\n\nSolve for K:\n\nK -3K=1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say L1=4 when n=1.\n\nSo, L1= C*3^1 -1/2 =4\n\nThus, 3C -1/2=4 \u21923C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n=9, L9=29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177,147\n\nSo, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, using a recurrence relation, and applying a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. So I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I was computing each layer, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I want to make sure that I correctly computed each layer. Let me recheck each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without expanding each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, more generally, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nMultiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_i \\) where:\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 \\)\n- and so on, up to \\( a_9 \\)\n\nComputing each layer step by step:\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, with characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors because both methods led me to the same result, and I double-checked each step. So, yeah, that's how I solved it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without manually calculating each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. However, it's good to know the general formula in case the problem becomes more complex or has more layers.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we find that the innermost layers compute to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives us the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.

Because each layer was built from the previous one, so maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$ So, it's 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, that was the value inside the parentheses, and then I multiplied by 3, which is correct. So, 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. If L_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check if that works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes, that works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. Because 3^10 is indeed 59,049, right? Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to see if they all match.\n\nUsing L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093.

Correct.\n\nSo, all layers match the formula, so the final computation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning or computations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Plugging into the equation:\n\nK = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a).\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + b/(1 - a).\n\nUsing the initial condition, say when n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. Wait, but in our case, L_1 is 1 + 3, so L_1 = 4. Wait, but if we consider L_0 as the innermost layer, which is just 1 + 3 = 4, but actually, in the problem, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, so perhaps L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, etc.\n\nSo, if n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the general solution: L_n = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition at n=1: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5.\n\nWait, let's test this for n=1: L_1 = 1.5*3^1 - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = 1.5*9 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = 1.5*27 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: 1.5*81 - 0.5 = 121.5 - 0.5 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: 1.5*243 - 0.5 = 364.5 - 0.5 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: 1.5*729 - 0.5 = 1093.5 - 0.5 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: 1.5*2187 - 0.5 = 3280.5 - 0.5 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: 1.5*6561 - 0.5 = 9841.5 - 0.5 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: 1.5*19683 - 0.5 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, where L_9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5, then 3*L_n = 3*(1.5*3^n - 0.5) = 4.5*3^n - 1.5.\n\nBut 3*L_9 = 4.5*3^9 - 1.5.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 4.5*19683 = ?\n\n4.5 is the same as 9/2, so 9/2 * 19683 = (9*19683)/2.\n\nCompute 9*19683:\n\n19683 * 9:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\nMinus 19683: 196830 - 19683 = 177147.\n\nSo, 177147 / 2 = 88573.5\n\nThen, subtract 1.5: 88573.5 - 1.5 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{inner expression})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me recount that.\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, when I compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, no carry.\n\nSo the result is 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524 first:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo that gives 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8, carry 0\n\nSo the result is 88572.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If a_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Setting them equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me compute 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000, subtract (30000 - 29524) = 476, so 90000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer's computation because if I made a mistake in one layer, it will propagate through all subsequent layers. So, let's go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series. Let me recall that a geometric series has the form a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). But in this case, each term is multiplied by 3, so perhaps it's a geometric series with ratio 3, but the structure is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*(next term). Wait, maybe I can model this recursively. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1, each layer depends on the previous one. So, for n layers, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9, since the outermost expression is 3*(L_9).\n\nSo, let's see if there's a formula for L_n. Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, substituting n = 1 into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer manually. That's a good check because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when computing layer by layer, especially with so many layers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer is \\( L_{n} = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 \\). \n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 repeatedly. Let's see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which is a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince the original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, another way to compute this is to recognize the pattern and use the formula, which might have saved time instead of computing each layer manually. But since I was doing it step by step, it worked out correctly.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can see a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, I notice that each layer seems to be following a pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of layer n.\n\nGiven that each layer is 1 + 3*L(n-1).\n\nSo, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me apply this.\n\nWe know that L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, plugging n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can find another equation by considering the next term. Let's compute L(2) using the recurrence:\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNow, using the general solution for n=2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this works with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

So, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2=29524, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer step by step, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading up to Layer 9, which is 29524. The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, resulting in 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume solution is a_n = C*3^n + D.\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSo, LHS: C*3^n + D = RHS: 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D.\n\nSo, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: the innermost is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, then layer 2 is a_2 = 13, up to layer 9, which is a_9 = 29524.\n\nUsing the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but it's easy to see how a formula would be helpful if there were more layers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, a closed-form formula is derived to find the value efficiently. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute it without calculating each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For each subsequent layer, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280.

Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, we can compute Layer 9 directly without calculating each previous layer.\n\nLayer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that seems a bit off because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, Layer 1 was 1 + 3, which is 4. So, the recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1), starting with Layer 1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is Layer n = A * 3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1) = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But Layer n is also equal to A*3^n + B. Therefore, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Additionally, by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I confirmed that Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2, which for n=9 gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each being 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me check: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3). Compute 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So total is 1200+210=1410+18=1428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.

So, for example:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed 9. Each time I have a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. So, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- After the first 3, the first ( is at position 1: 3(...\n\nThen inside that, another ( at position 3: 3(1+3(...\n\nContinuing, each \"1+3(\" introduces another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(\n\n3. And so on, until the innermost is 1+3)\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\n- The first is 3(1+3(\n\n- Then inside that, another 1+3(\n\n- So, each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first one after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", which would correspond to 9 layers.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's 8 layers because the initial 3 is outside of the first \"1+3(...)\".\n\nWait, maybe I should visualize the structure:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(A), where A is 1 + 3*(B), where B is 1 + 3*(C), and so on, until the innermost part is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, each time you have a new layer, you add another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(\n\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting from the first one after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression has:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. The first one after 3( is the first layer.\n\n2. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" is another layer.\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there?\n\nLooking at the string: \"1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\"\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n- The first one is at the start: 1+3(\n\n- Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" inside.\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+3(\", each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nSo, let's parse the string:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n\n2. Then inside that, 1+3(\n\n3. Then another 1+3(\n\n4. Another 1+3(\n\n5. Another 1+3(\n\n6. Another 1+3(\n\n7. Another 1+3(\n\n8. Another 1+3(\n\n9. Then, the last one is 1+3(...), but wait, the innermost is 1+3), which is 1+3 followed by a closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3 is the first layer.\n\n2. Then each subsequent \"(\" inside adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"(\" after the initial 3 is 9. Because each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer.\n\nWait, but let me count them:\n\n- After 3, the first \"(\" is at position 2: 3(...\n\n- Then inside that, another \"(\" at position 4: 3(1+3(...\n\n- Then another \"(\" at position 6: 3(1+3(1+3(...\n\nAnd so on, until the innermost \"(\" at position 20: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just accept that there are 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the expression has 9 of them. So, starting from Layer 1 as 1+3, up to Layer 9 as the outermost one.\n\nSo, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me confirm that again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I computed Layer 9 as 1 + 3*Layer8, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, that's correct. Then, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer9, which is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nThen, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times the Layer9, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But let me just make sure that I didn't make any mistake in calculating the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, we can write a recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, let me think about solving the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer step by step, verified each layer with the formula, and confirmed that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), so we compute:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's compute each digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So putting it all together, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, let me confirm that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, carry 1, write 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry 1, write 5. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry 2, write 8. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, that gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)). Each time, it's 1+3(...). How many times does this happen? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the innermost is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) layers. From the inside out: 1+3 (Layer 1) is inside 1+3(Layer1) (Layer 2), which is inside 1+3(Layer2) (Layer3), and so on, until Layer9, which is the outermost. So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier computation is correct with 9 layers, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could represent this nested expression. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. Let me write out the terms again using this notation: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. To confirm, maybe I can look for a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recursive approach seems more straightforward. Another way is to recognize that each layer is building up a number that's one more than three times the previous, which leads to exponential growth, hence the formula involving 3^{n}. In any case, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead me to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by the outermost factor of 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is indeed 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the recurrence solution because sometimes the indexing can be tricky. I defined a_1 as the first layer, which is 1 + 3. But in the expression, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if I have nine layers, does that mean n goes from 1 to 9? Let me see: The innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1). Up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, yes, n goes from 1 to 9, and a_9 is as computed. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. So, after all that, I think the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern that can be modeled with a recurrence relation, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me verify each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire original expression using the formula for a geometric series, since each layer is a term in a geometric progression.\n\nWait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so each layer is a term in a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as we found.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let's denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Wait, but S itself is the outermost expression, so maybe I can express S in terms of itself, but since it's only 9 layers deep, perhaps that's not the easiest way. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression inside S is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me think of it as 1 + 3x, where x is the next layer, which is 1 + 3y, and so on. But perhaps using the formula for a finite geometric series would be better.\n\nWait, in the recurrence relation approach, we found that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if I can write the entire original expression as a sum. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(next expression), so each layer adds a 1 and then multiplies by 3 the next term. So, perhaps the entire expression, before the outermost 3, is a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nSo, each layer adds another 3^k term.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression before the outermost 3 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first layer, it's 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, yes.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, yes.\n\nSo, each layer is adding another power of 3, so after n layers, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1, then the next is 1 + 3 + 3^2, and so on, up to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, since there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, let's check: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer adds another 3^k term, where k increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the expression inside the outermost 3 would be the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, but wait, actually, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1, so perhaps the sum is from k=0 to 8, but shifted.\n\nWait, let me think again. The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term, so after n layers, the expression is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but starting from k=1. Wait, no, because the first term is 1, which is 3^0, then 3^1, 3^2, etc.\n\nWait, in the innermost layer, it's 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1, so that's two terms: 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nThen, the next layer adds 3^2, so it's 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nAnd so on, up to the 9th layer, which would be 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, so if there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost, which is 3^1, then the outermost layer would have up to 3^8. So, the sum inside the outermost 3 is 3^0 + 3^1 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which would make the innermost term 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3^k.\n\nWait, so if there are 9 layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another power of 3. So, the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3 would be the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k.\n\nWait, let me check: The sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, if n=8, the sum is (3^9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, which is 3^10 - 1 over 2, which is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the number of layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time I see a 1+3(, that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, Layer9 is 1 + 3*(Layer8), which would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(Layer7)), and so on.\n\nBut in terms of the sum, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, as per the recurrence, we can model this as a geometric series.\n\nBut earlier, when I used the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, with n being the layer number, so for Layer9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, but I need to be careful about how many terms there are.\n\nWait, let's try to express the expression inside the outermost 3 as a sum.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(...), so when expanded, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some power.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, each layer adds another term. So, Layer9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8.\n\nSo, the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to Layer9, I got 29524, which is (3^10 -1)/2. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so the sum inside the outermost 3 is up to 3^8, which is 9 terms, from 3^0 to 3^8, which is 9 terms. Then, the sum is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(9841) = 29523, which is not matching my earlier result.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in my reasoning here.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each layer adds another 3^k term.\n\nWait, but in the way I was counting before, Layer1 is 1+3, which is 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer3 is 1 + 3*(13) = 40, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, no, because Layer1 is sum from k=0 to 1: 1 + 3.\n\nLayer2 is sum from k=0 to 2: 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nWait, so Layer n is sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer9 would be sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the expression inside the outermost 3 was Layer9, which is the sum up to 3^9, but in reality, the number of layers is 9, so Layer9 is sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), with 9 layers. So, each time, you have a 1 plus 3 times another expression, and you do that 9 times.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, and then 3*9841 = 29523, which is not matching our earlier result.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1).\n\nLayer3 is 1 + 3*(Layer2).\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer9.\n\nSo, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer(n-1)).\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nNow, when I computed Layer9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, that's correct because Layer9 corresponds to n=9 in the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the expression inside the outermost 3 as Layer9, which is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, then that sum is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the expression inside the outermost 3 as the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, then 3*9841 = 29523, which is different. So, that suggests that the number of layers is 9, and thus the sum inside is up to 3^9, not 3^8.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how we count the layers. Let me try to count the number of times we apply the 1 + 3*(...) operation.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*: There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer.\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, so 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8), and so on, down to Layer1: 1 + 3.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside is from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if the approach works.\n\nSuppose I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(4) = 12.\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, with n=2 layers:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.\n\nThen, 3*a_2 = 3*13=39.\n\nWhich matches the manual computation.\n\nSimilarly, for n=1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. According to the formula: a_1=4, 3*a1=12. Correct.\n\nn=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120.\n\nAccording to the formula: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, then 3*40=120.

So the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of them. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what we got before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn our case, n=9, so total expression is (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, total expression is (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Perfect, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinal step: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or some recursive formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9, which gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I checked each layer step by step, then verified using a formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both approaches led to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step result. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term.

So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2192 Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recursive formula and the closed-form expression both lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0, where a_0 would be 1 if we go back one more step, but in our case, a_1 starts at 4. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a geometric series.\n\nWait, if we consider that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then expanding each term, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this, after n steps, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0.\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1, so a_0 would be 1. Thus, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k - 1.\n\nWait, but sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/ (3 -1) )= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step computation and the formula\u2014give the same result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, all the layers seem to be increasing correctly, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each step is 3 times the previous plus 1. Wait a minute, that's interesting. So, each Layer n is 3*(Layer n-1) + 1. So, if I model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have a system of equations:\n3A + B = 4\n9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nNow, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match my previous results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers computed using the formula match the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be certain that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each time we have 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, if I denote the innermost term as t, then moving outward, each term is 1 + 3t, where t is the next term. But in this case, since there are nine layers, it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's compute E by expanding each layer:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost part first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the expression as a sum:\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, if we have n layers, the expression can be represented as 3^n times some constant plus a geometric series. But in this case, with 9 layers, it's manageable as we did before.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly enough. Each step seems to be consistent, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, yes, Layer 9 is the result inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9. This looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.

After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting with 29524:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927\n\n5 *3=15\u21925, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28\u21928, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\u21928\n\nSo yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify that I computed each layer correctly. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without expanding each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, each layer is defined recursively. So, we can write a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. So, we can compute a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B +1\n\nSubtracting A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B +1\n\nSo, -2B =1 \u2192 B= -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1= A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) =4\n\nSo, 3A -1/2 =4 \u2192 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 +3(...\" is a layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1 +3(\" in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 1+3*(layer 8). So, in total, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, yes, my earlier computation was correct with 9 layers, leading to a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used both iterative computation and a formula approach, and both gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\), and each subsequent layer is defined recursively by \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\):\n   - Compute \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\):\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n   - Then, \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. So, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, when I compute Layer 9, that's the innermost part, right? Wait, no, actually, when I started, Layer 1 was the innermost, so Layer 9 would be the outermost. So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, then inside is 1 + 3(...), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1 + 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\nFrom the expression, the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears is 9 times. So, there are 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, a_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. Suppose the steady-state solution is a constant C, so substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that's a negative fraction, but our layers are all positive integers. That seems odd, but maybe it's correct.\n\nThen the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by recognizing it as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression.\n\nIn fact, the formula we derived earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
