    "text": " = ? Let me compute it step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together, we have 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, 5; carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8; carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier. So this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer. Since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost is a_9, so the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can derive the solution using a formula. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, as before.\n\nThen, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution can be expressed as a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, but I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, let's try to solve it step by step.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed before, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, because 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down8, carry over2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer), and each previous layer is similar, the entire expression is a geometric series multiplied by 3.\n\nBut given that I already have the recursive formula and the closed-form solution, and the computations check out, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nMultiply by3:88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\) where:\n- \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- \\(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- \\(a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- \\(a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- \\(a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- \\(a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- \\(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\\[ 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, I computed nine layers correctly, ending up with Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I didn't make a mistake in the calculations for each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify the multiplication again because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 29,524 * 3 in another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 * 9,000 = 27,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a moment, but let me think again. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer's value is 1 + 3*previous. So, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, to find a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds true for each layer. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, L(n) is the value at each layer. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59,049.\n\nSo, (59,049 - 1) = 59,048.\n\n59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the entire expression as 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check: 3^{11} is 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3) = 177,144.\n\n177,144 / 2 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the expression another way. Since each layer is L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3 * L(9), which is 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2. As above, that's 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut inside the parentheses, the expression is similar to E, except it's missing the initial 3 multiplier. Let me denote the inner expression as F, where F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to nine layers.\n\nWait, but since F is similar to E but without the outermost 3, perhaps I can relate F and E.\n\nWait, but E = 3*F, so F = E/3.\n\nBut F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to eight layers, which would be F = 1 + 3*F', where F' is the inner expression with eight layers. Hmm, this might not be the most straightforward approach, especially since the number of layers is fixed at nine. So, perhaps using the recurrence relation is more efficient.\n\nIn any case, since I've already computed each layer step by step and verified using the formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer from 1 to 9, I arrived at Layer 9 being 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication was incorrect because I might have misaligned the digits. It's better to do it as adding 29,524 three times or using the expanded form.\n\nSo, the final answer after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers. I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(...)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nEach time, the expression inside is another 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times we have 1 + 3(...).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nFrom the innermost, the first 1 + 3 is not inside any further parentheses, then each subsequent 1 + 3 is inside one more set. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, that seems correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the multiplication again because earlier I thought I had a discrepancy.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation instead of calculating each layer step by step.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but hold on: a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0? Wait, no, in our case, a_1 is the first term after the innermost layer. Wait, actually, let me check the indexing.\n\nWait, in our problem, Layer 1 is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the general solution: a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nSo, for n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 0.5 \u2192 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 \u2192 C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, the expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it and it matches.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost value before the final multiplication by 3 to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them step by step.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, 88572. Okay, that matches. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3: that's the first.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 1+3 is another layer. So from the innermost, 1+3 is the first, then each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n... and so on until the ninth layer. Wait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, each layer from 1 to 9 is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but I want to make sure that each layer's computation is correct.\n\nLet me recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I made any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Now, the final step is to multiply Layer 9 by 3, which is 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original problem is 3 times the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So, in my computation, I correctly computed Layer 9 as 29524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to, I could recognize this pattern as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since the number of layers isn't too large, expanding step by step seems manageable.\n\nBut just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer.\n\nLooking at each layer, I can see that each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the first layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find C, we can solve the equation by finding the steady-state solution. Let me set a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nThen, C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost layer results in 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated until the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: As above, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can use another method to verify. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something. Wait, but the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a finite nested expression, not an infinite one. So, perhaps each layer can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step, but since I've already broken it down into layers and verified with the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. Let me verify a couple of the layers to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That all adds up. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because I might have made a mistake in one of the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric series. The recurrence is linear and can be solved as a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost part, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but in our earlier computation, layer 9 was 29524. Let me compute (3^{10} -1)/2 and see if it matches 29524.\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Yes, that's exactly what I got earlier. So, layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the innermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or perhaps find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.

Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I just thought of something. When I computed Layer 9, I used Layer 8's result, which is 9841, and 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3*29524 is 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me think about how this would expand. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2, but I'm not sure. Let me test this idea. Let's see, for each layer, starting from Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Hmm, that works. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Let's see if that's (3^3 - 1)/2: (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, it seems that each layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Layer 1: (3^2 -1)/2 = 4, Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 13, etc. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Let's compute:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that Layer 9 was 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But let me check if my layers were correct because I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer1) is Layer2.\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer2) is Layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, because the expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each time wrapped in another 3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, each adding another 3*(...). So, my initial approach of computing Layer1 to Layer9 is correct.\n\nSo, Layer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 13\n\nLayer3: 40\n\nLayer4: 121\n\nLayer5: 364\n\nLayer6: 1093\n\nLayer7: 3280\n\nLayer8: 9841\n\nLayer9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*Layer9 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify each layer calculation again because I might have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to confirm.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, so maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me check a couple more layers.\n\nLayer5: 3*121=363, 363+1=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*364=1092, 1092+1=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*1093=3279, 3279+1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*3280=9840, 9840+1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*9841=29523, 29523+1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer is correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I interpreted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, yes, starting from the innermost 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation approach. It's easy to make a mistake with the exponents.\n\nWait, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is indeed 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: as above, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar, since each layer seems to be a geometric progression.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence can be solved, but since it's a linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k), but I might be misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the term would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I have 9 layers, then the innermost term is a_1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous term). So, the outermost term is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as we've calculated.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step calculation. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1+3=4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1+3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nNext layer:1+3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nNext:1+3*(40)=1+120=121\n\nNext:1+3*(121)=1+363=364\n\nNext:1+3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1+3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1+3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\nNext:1+3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think I can safely conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the structure, each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing 1 + 3*(previous total). So, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got:\n\nLayer 1:4= (3^2 +1)/2= (9+1)/2=10/2=5? Wait, no, that doesn't match. Wait, Layer 1 is 4, which is (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:13=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13.\n\nLayer3:40=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40.\n\nLayer4:121=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121.\n\nYes, so each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't find any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give me the same result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that matches. So 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29,524, correct. Then 3\u00d729,524 is indeed 88,572. Hmm, but wait, when I first computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29,524, but when I computed 3\u00d729,524, I got 88,572. But let me make sure that each layer is correctly computed because if any layer is wrong, it will throw off the entire calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final result is 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait a moment, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29,524, giving 88,572. But I want to make absolutely sure that each step is correct because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them.\n\nLet me try computing Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9,841. So Layer 9 is 1 + 3\u00d79,841. Let's compute 3\u00d79,841:\n\n9,841 \u00d7 3: 9,000\u00d73=27,000; 800\u00d73=2,400; 40\u00d73=120; 1\u00d73=3. Adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So 3\u00d79,841=29,523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3\u00d729,524: 29,524 \u00d7 3. Let's compute it again to be sure.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method. Let's break down 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo 20,000 \u00d73=60,000.\n\n9,000\u00d73=27,000.\n\n500\u00d73=1,500.\n\n20\u00d73=60.\n\n4\u00d73=12.\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of something. When I computed Layer 9, I used Layer 8 as 9,841, which was correct. But just to make sure, let's go through each layer once more:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524.\n\nEach step seems correct. So, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Maybe I can represent it recursively or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I double-checked each layer, derived a general formula, and confirmed that the result is consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's do it another way: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. The expression seems to be a recursive one, where each term is defined in terms of the previous. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, that's a good way to confirm it without computing each layer step by step. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nSo, the key was recognizing the pattern and setting up the recurrence relation, solving it, and then plugging in the number of layers. That way, I can avoid computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Looking back at the original problem: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me see: Starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...)), so each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times 1+3( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 instances of 1+3( before the innermost 1+3. So, that would mean 9 layers, correct? So, a_9 is the outermost layer, which we've computed as 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2 = 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, yes, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Perfect.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think that's about it. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but wait, earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. From the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3, so let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1). Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3( starts a new layer. Let me count them: 1. (1+3( 2. (1+3( 3. (1+3( 4. (1+3( 5. (1+3( 6. (1+3( 7. (1+3( 8. (1+3( 9. (1+3))))) So, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify the multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Correct. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to give the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " = ? Starting from the units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers because I think I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, let's list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's another way to approach it to verify.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find B first by setting a_n = B. Then, B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to 1 + 3*something. If we expand it, each layer contributes a term that is 3^k, where k is the depth of the layer. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, actually, if I consider the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the entire expression can be thought of as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to 3^9, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me test that.\n\nWait, no, because each term is 1 + 3*something, so when you expand it, each layer adds a term that's 3^k, but starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nThen: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nThen: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum: 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but that's a geometric series. Wait, let's compute that sum.\n\nSum = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683\n\nBut that's 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^8) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/ (3 -1 )) = 3*( (19683 -1)/2 ) = 3*(19682/2) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but that's 29523, which is exactly a_9 -1, since a_9 = 29524. So, the sum is 29523, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which expands to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but that sum is 29523, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, perhaps I'm conflating terms here, but the key point is that using the recursive formula and the general solution, I arrived at the correct answer.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers. I'll recompute each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, I can use another approach. Let me consider that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method also confirms the answer. I think it's solid now.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize the pattern as a base-3 number or something similar, but I don't think that's necessary here since the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation both lead to the same result.\n\nI can also check the arithmetic using a calculator, but since I don't have one handy, I'll rely on the step-by-step computation which seems consistent.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. Compute each layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524.\n\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " = ? Let's compute: 4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, but 29524 is 29,524. So 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them all up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, so 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try computing each layer again, just to be thorough. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Okay, so I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59,049. So, L_9 = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177,147. So, (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That makes me confident that 88,572 is the correct result. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer once again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.

    "text": "  = ? Let's compute: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me double-check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3(, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is another 1+3*(previous layer). So, in total, there are 9 layers, meaning I computed up to layer 9 correctly, which was 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made an error in adding or multiplying somewhere. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, my step-by-step computation seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see: Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a step-by-step approach or a derived formula, we find the result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me go back and check if I computed each layer correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120 + 3 = 123. So, 1 + 123 = 124. Wait, earlier I wrote 364 for Layer 5, which can't be right. Wait, hold on, did I make a mistake here? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, wait a second. Wait, I think I messed up the layers. Let me recount from the beginning because I think I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3(...), there's a 1+3(...), which itself contains another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of nested layers.\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), the innermost is the last 1+3, so let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, Layer 4 as 121, Layer 5 as 364, Layer 6 as 1093, Layer 7 as 3280, Layer 8 as 9841, Layer 9 as 29524.\n\nBut when I did Layer 5, I thought 3*121 is 363, which added 1 gives 364, which seems correct. But when I was recounting, I thought 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364, which is correct. So maybe my initial computation was correct. But let me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120 + 3 = 123. So 1 + 123 = 124. Wait, no! Wait, 3*121 is 363, not 123. Wait, that's where I might have messed up earlier. Wait, 3*121: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. So 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Hmm, maybe my initial doubt was misplaced. Let me check if I can find another way to compute this, perhaps using a formula for geometric series or something, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can model it as such.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nEach subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check if that works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. But since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it with the step-by-step method, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any errors in my reasoning. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, leading to the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. With 9 layers, the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed until the 9th layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 is also correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo yes, that's nine layers, each adding another 1+3*(...).

Alternatively, I could think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. If it were more layers, maybe a formula would be better, but here, step-by-step is manageable. Let me just confirm the arithmetic for each layer once more:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer's result is used in the next. After calculating each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's value by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:** 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I was computing each layer, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems right, but let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I think my process is correct. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers, just to see if I get the same result. Although that might be time-consuming, it's a good way to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, let me see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, which is the argument of the outermost 3. So, the argument is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. That matches our earlier computation. So, yes, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(... nine times...)))). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is the innermost, then each layer wraps around that. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so actually, the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, my earlier computation is correct, with 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+\" appears after the initial 3:\n\n1. 1+3(\n\n2. 1+3(\n\n3. 1+3(\n\n4. 1+3(\n\n5. 1+3(\n\n6. 1+3(\n\n7. 1+3(\n\n8. 1+3(\n\n9. 1+3(\n\nThen, the next is 1+3, which is the innermost, so that's 9 layers.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial count was correct. So, 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps it's a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis kind of recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1, r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = (c / (1 - r)) + r^n * (a_0 - c / (1 - r)).\n\nWait, but let me check. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n = r*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = A*r^n, where A is a constant.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_p.\n\nLet a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c / (1 - r).\n\nBut since r = 3, which is greater than 1, this would be negative, but in our case, the particular solution is K = 1 / (1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because our terms are positive and increasing. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + K, where K is a particular solution.\n\nWait, let me try again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's take n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn = 3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn = 4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn = 5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's another way to compute it, using the formula.

Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nBut since I already have the closed-form formula, I think that's sufficient.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the way it's nested, it might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a recursively defined sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3a_9. So, we can model this with a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a closed-form expression also gives me the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 *3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 *3, because 30,000 - 29,524 = 476.

Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Okay, so 88,572 is correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, each \"1 +3(...)\" is a layer, and there are nine such layers inside the outermost 3. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the one before the outermost 3. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to be thorough, let me check with n=4: a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the formula works. Therefore, I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to a geometric progression. But since the initial step-by-step approach worked, and the recurrence confirmed it, I think I'm good. Just to recap, the process was: 1. Identify the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer as 1 + 3*(previous result). 3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. As a check, derived a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, confirmed that it matches the step-by-step results, and used it to compute the ninth layer. 5. Multiplied the ninth layer result by 3 to get the final answer. 6. Verified the calculations with different methods to ensure accuracy. So, yeah, that's how I would approach solving this problem. It seems a bit daunting at first because of all the layers, but breaking it down step by step and looking for patterns or formulas really helps simplify the process.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a general formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step results. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times, with an outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I checked each layer step by step, and then also derived a formula using recurrence relations, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. After computing the innermost layers, we find the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to verify.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down: (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3.\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Because when I was computing each layer, I went from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...), let's see:\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each layer is 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3*(1+3))\n3. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me count the number of layers properly.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\n1. Starting from the innermost: (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each layer adds another \"1+3(\", so:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...), I think there are 9 layers. Because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3 followed by another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, each layer is adding another 1+3(...). So, in my earlier computation, I had Layer1 to Layer9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, leading to Layer9 being 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but since it's only 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the pattern of a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, this confirms the same result as before. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and the recurrence relation approach aligns with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I went up to Layer 9, which was the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from the innermost 1 + 3). Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a3=1 +3*a2=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using this formula, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, the nth layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, leading to a closed-form formula. Applying this, the outermost layer is found to be 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572, which matches the sum I did earlier. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a geometric series or some recursive formula that can be applied.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine each layer's value until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested form where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, computing step by step seems manageable. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved more formally. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, which matches what I had before. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c = 3, d = 1. The formula for a_n would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me check what a_0 would be. If n=1, a_1 = 3*a_0 + 1. So, 4 = 3*a_0 + 1 \u2192 3*a_0 = 3 \u2192 a_0 = 1. So, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me compute a_1 using this formula: a_1 = 3^1 + (3^1 - 1)/2 = 3 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3 + 1 = 4. Correct. Similarly, a_2 = 3^2 + (3^2 - 1)/2 = 9 + (9 - 1)/2 = 9 + 4 = 13. Correct. So, in general, a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that simplifies to a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the general formula lead to the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if that formula works. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, the solution to a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has solution C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result. So, either way, the answer is consistent. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach backs up the step-by-step approach.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series but not exactly because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. That's consistent with what I got before. So, this method confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as building up a number in base 3 or something, but I think the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward here. Another way to see it is that each time, the expression is 3*(previous total +1). But since we have multiple layers, it's a nested structure, so the recurrence relation is the most systematic way.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. The answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
