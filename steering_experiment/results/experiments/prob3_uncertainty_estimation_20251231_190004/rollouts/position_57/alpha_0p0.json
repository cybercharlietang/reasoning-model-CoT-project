So, the final answer would be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to L_9. Now, perhaps I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^{2} + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations:\n1) 3A + B = 4\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5.\n\nThen, plugging back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3^{10} again. Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=3*3=9\n\n3^3=9*3=27\n\n3^4=27*3=81\n\n3^5=81*3=243\n\n3^6=243*3=729\n\n3^7=729*3=2187\n\n3^8=2187*3=6561\n\n3^9=6561*3=19683\n\n3^10=19683*3=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Wait, but let me verify that because 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the layers seem to compute correctly. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, perhaps using another method, to ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572, as before. So, this method confirms that the answer is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer using the closed-form formula to double-check. For example, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 =4, correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=13, correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=40, correct. a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=121, correct. a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=364, correct. a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093, correct. a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280, correct. a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841, correct. a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, correct. So, all layers computed via the closed-form formula match my earlier step-by-step calculations. Therefore, I can be confident that Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Just to ensure that I didn't make any multiplication errors, I can compute 29524*3 again. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another multiplication method:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 \u00d73=60000\n9000\u00d73=27000\n500\u00d73=1500\n20\u00d73=60\n4\u00d73=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the expression is essentially a geometric series with a ratio of 3 and a common difference of 1. The closed-form formula we derived earlier is a good way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value of the innermost layer efficiently. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated 9 times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + particular solution. To find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous +1. But I think the formula approach is more efficient. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

So, 29524 *3: Let's compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, but let me confirm each step because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C =4 +1/2=9/2\n\nC= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the formula.\n\nSince a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer, but since I already computed each layer and verified the formula, I think it's solid.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Let's assume a constant solution C, so substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

I don't see any calculation errors in the layers. Therefore, I think the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, perhaps using a different approach to verify. Alternatively, I could recognize that this is a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nwith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the sequence is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula holds for each layer, so it's a valid approach. Therefore, using this formula, the innermost layer (n=1) is 4, and the outermost layer (n=9) is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if we consider the entire expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, we get 88572 as the final answer, which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach yield the same result.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3*(...), and by recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to compute each layer and find the final result. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down into smaller parts made it manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you go out a layer, you're essentially multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in a base-3 system, but I'm not sure if that analogy helps here. Regardless, the key was to compute each layer step by step or find a general formula to compute the nth layer directly.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer is defined by the relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we find that the innermost layer (n=1) is 4, and the outermost layer (n=9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9000 = 58524, 58524 + 500 = 59024, 59024 + 24 = 59048. Now, add 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer computation. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. In this case, k=3, c=1. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Wait, let me recall the formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I computed earlier by expanding each layer. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so the expansion would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some terms. Wait, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it's a bit different. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). If I let x be the innermost expression, then x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which is similar to x = 1 + 3x, leading to x = (1)/(1 - 3) which is negative, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since we've already solved it using the recurrence relation and verified it with step-by-step computation, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the final answer would be 88572. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be found using the method for solving such recursions. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - c*a_{n-1} = 0, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. In this case, c=3 and d=1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the number of layers. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and there are 9 layers, perhaps there's a formula that can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something similar. Let me see. Each time we have a layer, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after 9 layers, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2, as we found earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Each layer is computed correctly, so the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute the entire expression using the general formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the general formula for the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug back A into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by substituting the value of the previous layer. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I did 29524 * 3, I thought it was 88572, but let me confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check with another approach. Let me try computing the expression step by step using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n goes from 1 to 9. Wait, but in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was 1 + 3, which is 4, which corresponds to a_1 = 4. So, Layer 9 would be a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression by expanding it, but that might be too tedious given the number of terms. But perhaps for the sake of thoroughness, I can try to see if the expansion makes sense.\n\nWait, but perhaps another way is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so each layer can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, but that's not quite accurate because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), not 1 + 3 + 9 + ... So, maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see that each layer a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which as we saw earlier, leads to a geometric progression. The closed-form formula we derived earlier is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, after verifying with two different methods, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*(29524) again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \nYes, that's consistent. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. First, the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 /2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the closed-form formula. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\).

So, 88572. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that multiplication because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.

Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer computation to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check with a different approach to be absolutely sure. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. The expression is a nested multiplication, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series but nested. Let me see. If I denote the innermost expression as a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term. Wait, let me check. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*r^n, and the particular solution would be a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Let me set a particular solution as a constant K. Then, substituting into the recurrence: K = c + r*K => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Now, in our case, c = 1, r = 3, and the initial condition is a_1 = 4. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for a geometric series. Since each a_n is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, the expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, and multiplied by 3 at each step. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to 9 layers. So, if I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Wait, actually, each layer is being multiplied by 3, so maybe it's a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but I need to verify. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k. Let me check. If I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers, then expanding it would give 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. So, that's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. The sum of a geometric series from k=1 to n is (r^{n+1} - r)/ (r - 1). So, in this case, r=3, n=9. So, the sum would be (3^{10} - 3)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 3)/2 =59046/2=29523. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k) =3*29523=88569. Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier result of 88572. Hmm, that's a problem. So, which one is correct? Wait, let me check the sum again. Wait, the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is indeed (3^{10} - 3)/2=29523. Then, 3*29523=88569. But earlier, I had 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. There's a discrepancy here of 3. So, that suggests that one of my methods is wrong. Let me figure out where I went wrong. First, let's consider the formula approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where the inner expression has 8 layers. Wait, but if I expand S, it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. But wait, actually, no, because each layer is a separate term. Let me think again. Let me try to express S as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, the first term is 3*1, the next is 3*3*1, then 3*3*3*1, etc., up to 9 layers. So, S = 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1. That's the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -3)/2=29523, as before. Then, S=29523. But earlier, I computed the innermost expression as 4, then each layer up to a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So, there's a conflict here. Where is the mistake? Let me check the formula approach again. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number of layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, moving out, each 1 + 3*(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each set is (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let's count: Starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times the pattern 1 + 3*(... occurs. Let's see:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n... and so on until the outermost.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: the original expression is 3*(...). Inside that, there's 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3*: (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, that would mean there are 9 layers inside the first 3*. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(layer 9). So, in the formula approach, the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k would be correct, which is 29523, and then 3*29523=88569. But according to the step-by-step layer approach, I had a_9=29524, leading to 3*29524=88572. There's a discrepancy of 3. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check the step-by-step layer approach again. Let me recompute the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in the formula approach, I thought the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is 29523, so 3*29523=88569.\n\nBut these two results differ by 3. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula approach is incorrect because the layers are not exactly the same as the sum of 3^k.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be represented as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. But when I computed the layers, I got a_9=29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But the sum of 3^1 to 3^9 is 29523, and 3*29523=88569. So, why the difference?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula approach is missing something. Let me check the sum again. The sum S = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Let me compute this sum:\n\nSum = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683\n\nLet me add these up step by step:\n\nStart with 3 + 9 = 12\n\n12 + 27 = 39\n\n39 + 81 = 120\n\n120 + 243 = 363\n\n363 + 729 = 1092\n\n1092 + 2187 = 3279\n\n3279 + 6561 = 9840\n\n9840 + 19683 = 29523\n\nSo, the sum is indeed 29523, and 3*29523=88569.\n\nBut according to the layer approach, the answer is 88572.\n\nThis suggests that one of the methods is wrong.\n\nWait, but in the layer approach, the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3*a_9, where a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, it's 3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k)=3*29523=88569.\n\nSo, the difference is 3. That suggests that perhaps the layer approach is incorrect because the innermost term is being counted differently.\n\nWait, let me think about the structure again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s being multiplied. Each time, we have 3 multiplied by the inner expression. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first layer is 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to layer 9, which is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the sum approach, I thought of it as 3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k)=3*(29523)=88569.\n\nBut perhaps the sum approach is not correctly modeling the expression. Because in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is different from just adding 3^k each time.\n\nWait, let me try to model the expression more accurately.\n\nLet me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers.\n\nLet me denote the inner expression as T, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 8 layers.\n\nThen, S = 3*(1 + 3*T)\n\nSimilarly, T = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 7 layers.\n\nWait, but this seems recursive. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a geometric series with each term being 3^k, but starting from k=1 up to k=9. But that seems to give a different result than the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, but when I computed the layers step-by-step, I got a_9=29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, S=3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in the sum approach, the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is 29523, so 3*29523=88569.\n\nThe difference is 3. So, perhaps the sum approach is missing a term or miscounting.\n\nWait, let me think again about the structure. Each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first layer is 4=1+3.\n\nThe second layer is 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nFourth:1 + 3*40=121.\n\nFifth:1 + 3*121=364.\n\nSixth:1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nSeventh:1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nEighth:1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nNinth:1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, S=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the formula approach gave me a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nBut the sum approach gave me a different result because I was considering S=3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k)=3*29523=88569.\n\nSo, the issue is that the sum approach is incorrect because the expression isn't simply the sum of 3^k from k=1 to 9, but rather each term is built by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, leading to a different total.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is the step-by-step layer computation, which gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, which is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then S=3*a_9=88572.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by computing the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the step-by-step.\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think the sum approach was incorrect because I misunderstood the structure of the expression. The expression isn't a simple sum of 3^k terms, but rather each term is built recursively by 1 + 3*(previous term), leading to a different total.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and multiply the final result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Final Layer by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nPlugging into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSimplify: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a direct formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, the expression becomes (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's a more efficient way. So, recognizing the pattern and using the formula for a geometric series can save time.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation, which can be solved using a formula, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where:\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 \\).

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my computations because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I could have used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve for A and B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. As n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A=0, but in our case, since each layer is finite, maybe we can find a particular solution. Alternatively, since the recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1, we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me count the layers again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if we have 9 layers, then Layer 9 is the outermost one. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that's solid. Just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula and see if they match. Let's try Layer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches our earlier computation. Layer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, yeah, the formula holds. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but going through it step by step and then verifying with the formula gave me the same answer. So, I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), forming a recursive pattern.

So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which we calculated as 88572. Hmm, but let me check 29524*3 again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute each digit: 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. But since we're multiplying by 3, we need to consider carries. Let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me check the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that should correspond to the innermost part, which is correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, I think my process is correct. Let me summarize the steps:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result into the next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. Repeat this process for each layer until reaching the outermost one.\n4. After computing the outermost layer, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nEach step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Actually, thinking about it, this might be a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1, starting from a(1) = 4. If I can find a formula for the nth term of this sequence, I could compute it without having to go through each layer manually, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), doing it step by step is feasible. However, for a larger number of layers, finding a closed-form expression would be more efficient. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation is straightforward.

So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 +3=4.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B. So, assuming L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

Since the outermost expression is 3*(L9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). So, that's 3*(59048/2)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire thing as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). But I think 88572 is the numerical answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

So, 90000 -1428=88572. That's another way to check.\n\nWait, 30000 -29524=476. So, 29524=30000 -476. Then, 29524*3=30000*3 -476*3=90000 -1428=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, all checks lead me to believe that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total is 3*29524=88572. So, that should be the final answer. But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) seems like it's a geometric series or something, but maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach since each layer is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me try to find the closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches my earlier calculation. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(something), so if I expand it all, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But perhaps that's more complicated than necessary.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and verified with the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer to check the pattern.\n\nFor example, let's compute a_5 using the formula: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the formula seems solid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, 30000 * 3 = 90000, subtract 476 * 3 = 1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go through the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me recall that a geometric series has the form a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^n. In this case, each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so maybe it's a finite geometric series. Let me try to model this. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Then, we can compute a2, a3, ..., a9 step by step, which is exactly what I did earlier. Alternatively, we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in our case, a1 = 4, and each subsequent a_n is built upon that. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a geometric progression. Let me try to write out the terms. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the step-by-step computation confirms that the result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a sum. Let's see: Each a_n can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's try to write a general formula for a_n. From the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the general formula seems to hold. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. That's a good check. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a step. I computed Layer 9 as 29524, but is that correct? Let me check the layers again because maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9 \u2192 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.

Compute 3*9841: Let's do 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3 \u2192 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think there are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, the computation is correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting with a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3a1, a3 = 1 + 3a2, and so on up to a9. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we're dealing with a9, which is the 9th term, n=9. So, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. Let me check one of the layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Let's take Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to find A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recursion: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found before. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same result. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layer computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which propagates outward.\n\nLet me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer seems to be computed accurately. Therefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nThus, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the nth term to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested structure with nine layers of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me check my computation again because when I did it earlier, I thought of 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, but that's not accurate. Let's see: 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine layers, computing each step is manageable, as I did. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent a_n. Let's consider solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3K = 1\n-2K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation.

    "text": " __________ 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a=3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = (L_1 - d)/(a - 1) * a^{n} + d, where d is the particular solution. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume the particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, that seems messy, but let's proceed. The homogeneous solution is L_h = C*3^{n}. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, when n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be expanded as 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to some terms. Wait, but each layer is multiplied by 3, so perhaps it's a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to write out the expansion. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) If I expand this, the inner part is similar to E, but without the initial 3. Wait, actually, let me define E properly. Let me define E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) But that's too nested. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as a series where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the previous layer is similar, perhaps the total expression can be written as a sum of powers of 3. Let me think. If I expand E, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try expanding it step by step. Let me denote the innermost part as S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. S_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. S_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. S_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. S_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. S_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. S_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, E = 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, using the formula I derived: S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*S_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of E as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) Let me expand this: E = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But that seems to just take me back to the original expression. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try writing out the expansion:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let's expand this step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, and we found that S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and E = 3*S_9 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can see this as a geometric series. Let me consider that each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nWait, if I think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), then E can be written as 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But that seems recursive again. Alternatively, perhaps E can be expressed as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10}.\n\nWait, let's check that. If I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I expand the innermost part, it's 1 + 3 = 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, when I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, but each time, it's adding another 3. Let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1 + 3^{10}*1? Wait, no, because each time you go a layer deeper, you multiply by another 3. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so n=9. So, perhaps E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since we've already computed S_9 = 29524, and E = 3*S_9, which is 88572, maybe that's the simplest way.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each layer S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " ___________ Let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,7,5,2. Wait, that would be 88752. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572 as well. So why did I get confused earlier? Because when I broke it down digit by digit, I think I might have miscounted. So the correct multiplication is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers, which would throw off the entire result.

Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Wait, but when I first did the multiplication, I thought it was 88752, but upon adding, it was 88572. So which is it? Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it without going through each layer step by step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation method, we also arrive at the same answer, confirming that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is to recognize the pattern as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But in this case, since each term is nested, it's actually a finite geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 each time, but with a specific structure. However, since we already have a recurrence relation that gives us the exact term, maybe that's the more straightforward approach.\n\nWait, but just to explore this angle, let's see: If we expand the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. The next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, that's interesting. It seems like each layer is the sum of a geometric series up to that point. Specifically, Layer n is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1 = 4. But 1 + 3^1 = 4, which is the same as (3^2 - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, which is (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121.\n\nWait a minute, this seems to hold. So, in general, Layer n is the sum of the geometric series from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but earlier we had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the sum of the geometric series up to 3^n. So, each Layer n is equal to the sum S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what we found earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * S_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the expression can be seen as a geometric series, and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer individually. That's pretty cool because it saves time, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step isn't too bad, but it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the sum S_n for n=9 using the formula and see if it matches Layer 9.\n\nS_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, the problem is solved correctly, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the layers, which propagates outward. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a structure.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nSo, 3a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see:\n\nDefine a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A\u00d73^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\nAssume a_n = A\u00d73^{n} + B\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nA\u00d73^{n} + B = 1 + 3(A\u00d73^{n-1} + B)\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3A\u00d73^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A\u00d73^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A\u00d73^{n} + B\nRight side: A\u00d73^{n} + 1 + 3B\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nA\u00d73^{n} + B = A\u00d73^{n} + 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract A\u00d73^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, subtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A\u00d73^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2) \u00d7 (1/3) = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)\u00d73^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the possibility of a formula, which turned out to be a good check. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By computing each layer step by step and then applying the recurrence relation formula, we find that the result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, each layer is computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or perhaps something that can be modeled with a recursive formula. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, the homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, and the nonhomogeneous part is the constant term 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for n=9, which is our outermost layer:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more efficiently using the formula for such a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute it directly without computing each layer step by step.

First, write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the recurrence relation is correct. Now, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods, step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula, lead to the same answer. Thus, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with an initial condition, we derive a closed-form solution. After computing each layer up to the ninth level, we find the value inside the outermost parentheses and then multiply it by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me confirm: the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is indeed 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms the result. The final computation gives:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the original expression. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3(, there are 9 more \"1+3(\" before the innermost 1+3. So that would mean 9 layers, right? So, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) So, that's 3 layers. Let me compute that manually. Innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should be correct, giving me 88572 as the answer. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for a_n, where n starts at 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can confirm that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer:\n\nSince a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = (3*59048)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is the same.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using this recurrence, we compute each layer up to the ninth, resulting in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, so 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, writing it together: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, but that would be 88572. Let me confirm by another method: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when expanded, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let's try expanding it step by step: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Next:1 + 3*13=40, etc. But since we've already confirmed that with the formula, maybe that's sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 + something). Wait, but I think the approach we took earlier is solid, so I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result, leading to the outermost expression being 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But in this case, the innermost expression is finite, with nine layers. So, it's not an infinite geometric series, but a finite one with a specific depth.\n\nAlternatively, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for n=2, f(2)=1 + 3*f(1)=1 + 3*4=13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, f(3)=1 + 3*f(2)=1 + 39=40, which is correct.\n\nSo, in this case, the innermost layer is f(1)=4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*f(n-1). So, f(9) would be the value at the ninth layer, which is 29524 as computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for f(n). Let me try to find a pattern.\n\nGiven f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1). The characteristic equation is r=3, so the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution, f_p(n). Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n)=A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, f(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: f(1)=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, f(n)=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is f(1)=4, and the outermost layer is f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute f(9):\n\n3^{10} is 59049.\n\nSo, f(9)=(59049 - 1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since f(9)=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*f(9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me ensure that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds one layer. Starting from the innermost, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", which means there are 9 layers. Therefore, n=9 in our formula, so f(9)=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively doing 3^{n} where n is the number of layers. But since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), the formula we derived earlier is more precise.\n\nI think I've double-checked my work enough times, and each step seems to align correctly. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But let me check if I didn't make any arithmetic errors in these calculations.\n\nLet me verify each step:\n\na_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to confirm.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only requires computing up to a_9, it's more straightforward to compute each term step by step as I did.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to notice a pattern or formula for a_n. For example, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be rewritten as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c) for some constant c. Let me try to find c.\n\nAssume a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Expanding, we get a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Rearranged, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 2c. Comparing this with the original recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can set 2c = 1, so c = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the sequence can be expressed as a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). This means that each term a_n + 1/2 is 3 times the previous term plus 1/2. So, this forms a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, a_n + 1/2 = 3^{n} * (a_0 + 1/2). But wait, a_1 is 4, so a_1 + 1/2 = 4.5. Then, a_1 + 1/2 = 3^{1}*(a_0 + 1/2). But we need to find a_0. Wait, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0? Wait, no, because the initial term is a_1 = 1 + 3. So, perhaps a_0 is undefined here. Alternatively, maybe I should adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better not to go into the general formula since the problem only requires up to a_9, and computing each step is manageable.\n\nIn any case, the step-by-step computation seems correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Wait, 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, let's see: Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \nThen the final result is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*next layer. So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}. But since we're starting from the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3, and then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then the total is 3*a_9. Alternatively, perhaps this can be represented as a geometric series. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let's see:\n\nFrom the layers computed:\n\na1 = 4  \na2 = 13  \na3 = 40  \na4 = 121  \na5 = 364  \na6 = 1093  \na7 = 3280  \na8 = 9841  \na9 = 29524  \n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check: a2 = 3*a1 + 1? 3*4 +1 = 13, which matches. a3 = 3*a2 +1 = 3*13 +1 = 40, correct. a4 = 3*a3 +1 = 3*40 +1 = 121, correct. So, indeed, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, starting from a1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, a9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. This pattern follows a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a general formula. Applying this formula to the innermost layer and working outward, the final result is computed as 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to recognize the pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: solve a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nAssume a_p is a constant, so a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because substituting into the equation:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nWhich implies 0 = 2*a_p + 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nBut since our initial terms are positive integers, a particular solution of -1/2 doesn't seem to fit. Maybe I made a mistake in setting it up.\n\nWait, actually, the nonhomogeneous term is 1, so the particular solution should satisfy a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nWait, that's the same as above. So, solving for a_p:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\n0 = 2*a_p + 1\n\na_p = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that's correct, but it's a negative fraction, which seems odd given that all our layers are positive. But perhaps that's okay because the homogeneous solution will dominate.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121.

Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now.
