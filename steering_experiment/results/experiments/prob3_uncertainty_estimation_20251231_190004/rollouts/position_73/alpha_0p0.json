    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might relate to a geometric series. Let me think about it. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = b^n * L_0 + a*(b^n - 1)/(b - 1), assuming b \u2260 1. In this case, a=1 and b=3. So, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, let's see. Let me check with n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_0 is the base case, which is 1, then L_1=1+3*1=4, which matches. Similarly, L_2=1+3*L_1=1+12=13, which also matches. So, using the formula, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^n - 1)/2. If L_0 is 1, then L_n = 3^n + (3^n -1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that seems promising. Let me test it for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost part before the final multiplication by 3, n=9. So L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as starting from the innermost and building up, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous total). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, the first layer is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572. Yep, that all checks out. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine that the innermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Let's go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because that seems like a big number, and sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to find both A and B. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I didn't make any mistakes in my step-by-step computation, and the general formula confirms it. So, yeah, 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by that recursion. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time in the future. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the original problem has 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same result. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms it. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572 Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can check using a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which is similar to a geometric series but not exactly because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such nested expressions. Suppose I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )). This is a recursive expression. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 L_2 L_2 = 1 + 3 L_3 ... Wait, no, actually, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n+1}. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, since each layer is built from the previous one, maybe I can express it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, but that might not capture the nesting correctly. Wait, let me think. The innermost layer is L_1 = 1 + 3. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, I can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start without computing each layer, but since I didn't think of it initially, breaking it down step by step was a good exercise. It's also reassuring that both methods lead to the same answer.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without so many steps. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But L_n is also supposed to be A*3^n + B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, let's use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give me the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This results in each layer following the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. I can also check by computing a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, Layer 5: n=5, L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, Layer 6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote the nth layer as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, recursively, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's the solution. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step helped me avoid mistakes. Also, verifying with the formula for the linear recurrence was a good check. So, I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me check my computations again because I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Wait, no, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80. So 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check 29524*3 once more to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, it's 88572. Wait, but let me compute 29524*3 another way to verify. 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around it with another 1+3*(...). So, each time we go out a layer, we add another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+...). It's 8 opening parentheses, which would mean 8 layers? Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Wait, because the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3), then Layer 2: (1+3*(Layer1)), up to Layer9, which is the outermost. So, my initial computation was correct with 9 layers. Therefore, 3*(Layer9)=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or look for a pattern. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve it: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but in our case, Layer1 corresponds to a_1=4, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4. Correct. So, for Layer9, which is the outermost, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is indeed 88572.

But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recount the layers: Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also find another equation by considering n=2: L_2 = 13 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) and 9A + B = 13 (from n=2). Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building a geometric series. But since the expression is finite with nine layers, the step-by-step approach worked well. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify one more layer. Let's check Layer 4: L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Using the formula: L_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I can be confident that my final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built upon the previous one. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 1: n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. Layer 2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which is correct. Layer3: n=3, a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So this formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as before. So, that's another way to compute it without manually stepping through each layer, which is more efficient and less error-prone. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me check if I correctly computed each layer because that's a lot of steps, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let's consider a general form: Let\u2019s say we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))) with n layers. In our case, a =1, b=3, and n=9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, perhaps there's a formula for the sum S_n = a + b*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = a + b. Wait, in our case, each layer is S_k = 1 + 3*S_{k-1}, starting from S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed. So, S_1 = 4, S_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, S_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the recurrence relation is S_k = 1 + 3*S_{k-1}, with S_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for S_n, which could save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation S_k = 1 + 3*S_{k-1}, with S_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is S_k - 3*S_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is S_h = C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution S_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is S_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition S_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is S_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with k=1: S_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. k=2: S_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. k=3: S_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, S_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9 layers, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result. So, using the formula is much quicker and reduces the chance of error. But since I was able to compute it manually by expanding each layer, both methods work.

Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that could represent this. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is a linear recurrence, which can sometimes be solved using geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a_1. Expanding the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_0). Wait, but a_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. So the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let's compute Layer 9 using the formula. Layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be a sum of terms where each term is 3 raised to a certain power, but I think the step-by-step computation is clearer in this case. Another way to look at it is that each layer is adding another 3 times the previous total, which is similar to a geometric progression. But since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit more involved. But the formula I derived earlier simplifies it nicely.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me consider that each layer is a term in a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote the innermost term as a base case and see if I can find a pattern. Let me define a sequence where a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see if this sequence follows a pattern. Let's compute the values:\n\nn: 1, a_n: 4\nn: 2, a_n:13\nn:3, a_n:40\nn:4, a_n:121\nn:5, a_n:364\nn:6, a_n:1093\nn:7, a_n:3280\nn:8, a_n:9841\nn:9, a_n:29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. The recurrence seems to be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me check that:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\nYes, so the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we need a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula.\n\nBut regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward until we reach the outermost layer. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in these calculations. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in the intermediate steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.

Because I feel like maybe I missed a layer or miscalculated somewhere. Let me recount the layers: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, layers 1 to 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me list them again to make sure:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first saw the expression, I thought it was nine layers, but when I count the opening parentheses, it's actually nine layers. Let me check the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, counting the number of (1+3(...)) sections, it's nine. So, yes, Layer 1 is (1+3), and Layer 9 is the outermost. Therefore, my calculation seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check each step again because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out. So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find a general formula for the nth layer: \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for the outermost layer (n=9), we compute \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think if that applies here. In this case, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. The recursive formula is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is Layer n = 3*Layer n-1 + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4. So, when n=1, Layer 1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, it's (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't see the recursive pattern, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also led me to the same result. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

Hmm, but let me cross-verify this because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Wait, 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3*29524: As before, 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Alternatively, maybe it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a1=4; n=2, a2=13; n=3, a3=40; and so on, up to a9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a9=88572. But maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms the previous result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time, it's more of a recurrence relation. Let me consider that. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, set a_n = B. Then, B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Hmm, that's a good confirmation.

Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let's go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, but in this case, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think about the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. Alternatively, I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and see if there's a pattern. But since I've already solved it using both step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, and both gave me the same result, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

So the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f. So it works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Which matches our previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved time and confirmed the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could be generalized, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in this case, a_1 is given. Wait, maybe I can derive it. Let's see:\n\nWe have a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which would be if a_0 is 1, because 1 + 3*1 =4. So, perhaps a_0=1, a_1=4, a_2=1 +3*a_1=13, etc. So, the general formula for a_n where n >=1 is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p =1 +3*a_p. Then, solving for a_p: a_p -3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2. Then, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2. So, C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3,... up to a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively calculating each layer, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is computed as 29,524.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, since the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant (since the nonhomogeneous term is constant), we can assume B is the particular solution. To find B, set L_n = B: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, plug B back into the first equation: 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the outermost expression. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*L_9, where L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each step manually, just to verify. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me define the expression recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.

So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time. But since the number of layers isn't too large (only 9), computing each step manually isn't too bad. However, if there were, say, 20 layers, it would be impractical to compute each one step by step, and the formula would be much more efficient. But in this case, since I only have 9 layers, both methods work. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrived at the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. But let me check with a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find L_9. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I think it's a geometric sequence. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence can be written as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution will be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, I'll try computing a couple more layers using the formula. For example, n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, as before. n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula is reliable. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct. So, after working through the problem step by step, computing each layer, verifying with a recurrence relation, and confirming with a closed-form formula, I conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct) So, yes, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplify both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed it using the formula. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when I compute layer by layer, I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recursive formula is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant solution L_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, Layer 4 is 121. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which can be represented as a geometric series. Let me think about that approach as well, just to confirm. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. If I expand it, it's a sum of terms where each term is 3^k, but I need to figure out how many terms there are and the coefficients. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we have L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then S = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it using iterative computation, using a recursive formula, and using a closed-form expression for the layers. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Sometimes, these can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for Ln. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So when n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as 3*(L9), where L9 is as above. So, using the formula, the value is 88572.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, after double-checking each layer, I see that each step is correct. So the final answer is indeed 88572. I think that's it. So, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but let me check my computations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 /2 =88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern and use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but I think I made a mistake because when I compute 29524 * 3, it should be 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1 + 3(...)\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So from the innermost, we have nine layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" inside each other. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first. Then each next layer wraps around that. So the expression has nine layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", and then the outermost is multiplied by 3. So I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_0 + c/(1 - k)) * k^n - c/(1 - k). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, right? Because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So here, k=3, c=1. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it using this method. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost layer, I computed each layer step by step, verifying each result. Then, I recognized the recurrence relation and solved it using the formula for linear recurrences, which gave me the same result for the innermost layer. Then, I multiplied by 3 and confirmed the result using two different methods: direct multiplication and applying the formula for the sum. Both methods gave me 88572, so I feel confident that's the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps thoroughly and checked my work multiple times, so I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. The structure of the expression is such that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built upon the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I calculated before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me solve this recurrence relation. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.

For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as I computed earlier. So that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each a_n is defined as (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}=177147, and 3*1=3. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous term, starting from the innermost \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because that seems like a lot. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Suppose a_n = D for all n. Then, substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But wait, I'm wondering if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nBut we also have L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time it's 1 + 3(...), starting from the innermost. So, starting from 1 +3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent 1 +3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of 1 +3(...): Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time you have 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, because each 1+3(...) has an opening parenthesis, and there are 9 such instances. So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the general formula, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(L_9). So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc., up to the outermost. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nEach time you have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then, moving out, each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. So, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time you wrap another 1+3(...), so each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have 1+3(...), which is 9 times. Because the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation and find a closed-form formula to compute the 9th layer directly.\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.

Correct.\n\nNow, multiplying 29524 by 3: As before, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln in terms of n.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nLn = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B = 1 + 3B => 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9. So, L9 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure, I can compute 3^10 again: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243, 243*3=729, 729*3=2187, 2187*3=6561, 6561*3=19683, 19683*3=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nThen, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute 3^10 is to note that 3^5=243, so 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2. Let's compute 243^2:\n\n243 * 243:\n\nCompute 200*243 = 48,600\n\nCompute 40*243 = 9,720\n\nCompute 3*243 = 729\n\nAdd them together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, yes, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, everything checks out. I think I've got the right answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
