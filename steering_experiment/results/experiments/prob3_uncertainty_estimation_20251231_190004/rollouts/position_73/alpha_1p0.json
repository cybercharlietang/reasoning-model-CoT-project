Wait, but let me cross-verify my earlier computations because sometimes when I compute each layer, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or some recursive formula. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 +1/2 = 3C => 9/2 =3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer. So, either way, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me check my earlier layers because when I was computing each layer, I might have made a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3=363. So 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Hmm, but wait, let me compute 3*29524 again to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think again. Is there a quicker way to compute this without having to go through each layer manually? Maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches. a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Thus, I'm confident that the computation is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've done the calculations correctly, both by step-by-step computation and by finding a general formula for the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I feel good about this solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. To solve this, I can recognize that it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to work. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, 88572. I think that's solid.

But wait, let me check my layers again because I think I might have made a mistake in counting how many layers there are. Let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So each \"1+3(\" is a layer, and each closing parenthesis is a layer end. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting after the first 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses, each adding another layer. So that would mean there are 9 layers inside the first 3(...). Therefore, when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, I correctly went through each layer. So Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40, Layer 4:121, Layer 5:364, Layer 6:1093, Layer 7:3280, Layer 8:9841, Layer 9:29524. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but when I think about it, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me verify the computations for each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Let me denote the expression as E(n), where n is the number of layers. So E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Wait, but earlier I had E(2) as 13. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps my definition is off. Wait, in the original problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). But the outermost expression is 3*(E(9)). So, perhaps I should model E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, E(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Which matches my earlier computation. E(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. So, yes, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1)=4. Then, the total expression is 3*E(9). So, to find E(n), we can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1, with E(1)=4. The general solution for such a recurrence is E(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's find B first by setting up the equation: E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1. Substituting E(n) = A*3^n + B into the equation: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, E(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition E(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: E(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: E(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: E(3) = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, E(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*E(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: Since E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*E(9) =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but let me cross-verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). It's a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). Let me denote the entire expression as E. So E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). But since each inner expression is similar, maybe I can express it recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. In this case, since there are 9 innermost (1+3) terms, n=9. So f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then the total expression is 3*f(9). So, using this recursive formula, we can compute f(9) step by step as I did before. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At n=1, f(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as computed earlier. For n=3: f(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So f(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner expression by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, leading to the final computation. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows us to compute the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable step by step.

Then 1+363=364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 3*9841. Let me compute that again. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. So that's correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, I think I did that correctly.

Let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. So starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1=1+3=4, L2=1+3*L1, and so on. So in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see, the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.

It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1 +3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is a_9 multiplied by 3, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me recount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9. Each time, I correctly applied the formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without doing each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4, and then each subsequent a_n is computed until a_9. Then the final answer is 3*a_9. So, using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have a_9, which is the 9th layer, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to compute 3*(a_9), and since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number, but maybe that's correct. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is straightforward, but since it's nonhomogeneous, we can solve it iteratively. Let's try to compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern. L1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so each Ln is 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let's see if we can express this as a geometric series. Let's try to expand L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L7)\n= 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*L7\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L6)\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L6\nContinuing this way, each expansion adds another term. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n * L1. But L1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Wait, so perhaps L9 can be expressed as the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, plus 3^9 * L1. Wait, let me check that. Let's see:\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and the solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is Lh_n = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say Lp. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nLp = 1 + 3*Lp => Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572. That seems right. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial step-by-step computation. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gave the correct result. So, I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. It's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's denote L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, we can write L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => Subtract 3*L_p from both sides: -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))) So, each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. So, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series or something similar. But given that each term is nested, it's a bit different. The formula I derived earlier is probably the most straightforward way. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is a linear recurrence, and solving it using the method for linear recurrences is the way to go. So, I think I've confirmed it enough. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can determine each layer's value step by step. The innermost layer is computed first, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. Using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, and building up to Layer 9, which is the one inside the first 3*(...). So, yes, that would be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the approach is correct. Alternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence, perhaps I can solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3, so the expansion would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, which is a bit different. Wait, let me see: If I expand the entire expression, maybe it's a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see: The innermost term is 1 + 3. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. It seems like each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps after n layers, the expression is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. So, for Layer 9, it's the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we found earlier. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is the sum up to 3^9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series multiplied by 3. So, the total is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. So, all methods point to the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each step was manageable. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula to verify this result. Looking at each layer, it seems like each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for this. The recursive formula is: Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, Layer(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: Layer(1) = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: Layer(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, Layer(9) would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer(9) = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous, it's a bit different. But the formula I derived earlier seems to work, so I think that's solid. Another way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively scaling the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, after nine layers, you have a value that's 3^9 times the innermost 1 plus some sum of 3^k terms. But perhaps that's complicating it more than necessary. Since I've already computed it step by step and verified it with a formula, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap: Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*(previous layer). After nine layers, Layer(9)=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using a derived formula, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then compute the entire expression step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Let me just cross-verify my steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. So starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 =13 L_3=1+3*L_2=1+39=40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. If we can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think I'm done here. The final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form is a nested expression where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This looks like a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and a particular solution would be a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this without computing each layer, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each step isn't too bad. But knowing the general formula is useful for understanding the structure of such expressions. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, and verifying with a general formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me recap the steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake: Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Let me verify each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 29524*3=88572. Seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe it's similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2= 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of (:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is the 10th term, but the layers are from 1 to 9 because each ( corresponds to a layer. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each 1+3(...) is a layer, and there are 9 such layers. So starting from Layer 1 as 1+3, then Layer 2 as 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So in my earlier computation, I computed Layer1 to Layer9 correctly, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40, Layer4=121, Layer5=364, Layer6=1093, Layer7=3280, Layer8=9841, Layer9=29524. Then 3*Layer9=88572. That seems correct. Let me verify with a smaller version to see if my method is correct. Suppose I have a smaller expression, say, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute this manually. Innermost Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Then 3*40=120. Alternatively, computing step by step: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))=3(1+3(1+3*4))=3(1+3(1+12))=3(1+3*13)=3(1+39)=3*40=120. Which matches. So my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, I can trust that for the larger expression, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each layer is following a recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where n >=2, and L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a general formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1=4. So, when n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, each layer Ln can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because if I made a mistake in one layer, the entire computation would be off. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let's denote the innermost expression as a base case and then build up. Let me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. Let\u2019s say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. a_3 = 1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form formula. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier terms: For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, which is n=1. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, n=2, and so on up to Layer 9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute a_9: 3^{10}=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient. Alternatively, if I had more layers, this formula would save a lot of time. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Let me just confirm once more by computing each layer again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), so it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to confirm. Let's compute a_4 using the formula: (3^5 -1)/2 = 243 -1=242/2=121. Which matches. a_5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula is correct, and the step-by-step computation was accurate. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when I compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works, just to confirm. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's denote the nth term as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4=13. a_3=1 + 3*a_2=40, and so on. This seems similar to a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2. Solving for C: 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. So the general solution is a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But since I've already confirmed it using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation. 3. Realize that the pattern fits a recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth term directly. 4. Use the formula to compute the 9th term, which is the outermost layer. 5. Multiply that term by 3 to get the final result. 6. Verify each step and the final answer to ensure accuracy. So, yeah, that's how I arrived at the solution. It took a bit of time, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth one, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computations. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. Let's see if that's the case. So, a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yes, that's the same as before. So, in general, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers here. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence relation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. Plugging in n=9, we get (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula for the nth layer, confirming the result. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me confirm each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back and recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 =4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me compute the terms using this recurrence to see if I get the same result. a1=4. a2=1+3*4=13. a3=1+3*13=40. a4=1+3*40=121. a5=1+3*121=364. a6=1+3*364=1093. a7=1+3*1093=3280. a8=1+3*3280=9841. a9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} directly and see if that helps, but I think the way I did it is correct. So, the answer should be 88572. Let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors. 29524 *3: 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

But wait, let me check my earlier steps because this seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me recap the layers: Layer1: 4 Layer2: 13 Layer3: 40 Layer4: 121 Layer5: 364 Layer6: 1093 Layer7: 3280 Layer8: 9841 Layer9: 29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, as that might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left-hand side: A*3^n + B. Right-hand side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Since the original expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have just computed each layer step by step, but recognizing the recurrence relation made it quicker and less error-prone. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer or recognizing the pattern and using the closed-form formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern or using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the closed-form solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Let me see if that applies here. Here, c=1, r=3. So, the homogeneous solution would be a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the previous step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which would be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let's define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute the terms using this recurrence relation: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, with characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, our initial term is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By defining each layer and applying the recurrence formula, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 29524 * 3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So adding together: 40000 + 18000 = 58000; 58000 + 1000 = 59000; 59000 + 40 = 59040; 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, from 1 to 9, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can apply here to verify. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. The general form for such a nested expression can be represented recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from f(1) = 4, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this recursive relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be f(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me set f(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364.

Alternatively, I could try to see if there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions, maybe a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be straightforward enough. Let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers. Layer 1: 4, which is 1 + 3. Layer 2: 13, which is 1 + 3*4. Layer 3: 40, which is 1 + 3*13. Layer 4: 121, which is 1 + 3*40. Layer 5: 364, which is 1 + 3*121. Layer 6: 1093, which is 1 + 3*364. Layer 7: 3280, which is 1 + 3*1093. Layer 8: 9841, which is 1 + 3*3280. Layer 9: 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841. Each time, the value is 1 + 3*(previous value). So each layer is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which is Layer 3. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result. So either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I get 88572 as the final answer. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recount the layers with the formula. For each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So Layer 1: n=1, a1=(3^2 -1)/2=4. Layer 2: n=2, a2=(3^3 -1)/2=13. Layer 3: n=3, a3=(3^4 -1)/2=40. Layer 4: n=4, a4=(3^5 -1)/2=121. Layer 5: n=5, a5=(3^6 -1)/2=364. Layer 6: n=6, a6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093. Layer 7: n=7, a7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280. Layer 8: n=8, a8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841. Layer 9: n=9, a9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524. Then 3*a9=88572. Yep, all the layers check out with the formula, so I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I'm done here. The final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since our problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.

Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because that's a lot of computations and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3, which is a constant ratio. Let me see if that approach works. The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see: Wait, the innermost is a_1, so the outermost is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So that matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, so it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, starting from 4. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and we've solved it already. So, yeah, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*term. So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 ... and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
