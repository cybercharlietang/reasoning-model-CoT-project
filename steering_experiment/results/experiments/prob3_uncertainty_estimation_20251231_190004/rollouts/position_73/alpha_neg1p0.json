But wait, let me cross-verify the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me list each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which might help avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the closed-form, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the value after nine layers is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer, but given that it's only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, this seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some time, but since I was computing each layer step by step, it worked out. So, to recap, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which simplifies layer by layer to 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me cross-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series. Let's see: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each term is 1 + 3a, where a is the previous term. This is a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct). So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check the number of layers again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...): There's 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). How many times does this happen? Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the first 1+3, then the next layer is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, no. Let me count the number of parentheses pairs. Each time we have a \"1+3(...)\", which is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then, 1+3*(1+3) is layer 2. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)) is layer 3, and so on. The original expression is 3*(layer 9). So, the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Therefore, layer 9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my computation of 9 layers seems correct, leading to 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming for more layers. Let me think about it. The expression seems to be a geometric series in disguise. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or something. Each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2)=3C -1/2. So, 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since it's only nine layers, both methods work. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct.

Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. If I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion, I might be able to compute it more quickly without having to go through each layer. Let's see. Let me denote the nth term as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, then a_2=13, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 first using the formula. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, using the formula, we can compute the result more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, for each layer n, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula to confirm.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression of the form x = 1 + 3x, but that seems too simplistic. Wait, but in this case, each layer is x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, starting from x_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for x_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1} Let me assume a solution of the form x_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Now, equate coefficients: On the left: C*3^n + D. On the right: C*3^n + (1 + 3D). Therefore, to satisfy the equation for all n, we need D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition x_1 = 4. When n=1, x_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, each layer x_n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me confirm: The innermost layer is Layer 1: x1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1: x1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Then Layer 2: x2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: x3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n: x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, x9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, x9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*x9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the result is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*x9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula for the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down step by step by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but let me check if I did the layers correctly. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let's recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers. So, my initial computation of 9 layers is correct. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, multiply by 3: 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3=88572. That seems correct.

Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. So, starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Alternatively, I could have thought of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each term is built upon the previous one, the closed-form approach seems more efficient. But either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I reach the same conclusion. So, I think I'm done here. The final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

Hmm, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step is manageable. Let me see if I can recognize a pattern in the numbers I obtained:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term/(r - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nActually, for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = a_1*k^{n-1} + d*(k^{n-1} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, no, let me check. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*k^n, and the particular solution when d is constant is a particular solution. So, for the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4, the solution can be found as follows.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, and the formula checks out with each layer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer (n=9), which equals 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from 4, each time it's 1 + 3n where n is the previous layer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.

So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on up to L_9.\n\nI can model this as a recurrence relation: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 +270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 +840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series or perhaps follows a recursive pattern. Let me see if I can model this with a formula. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute a_1 to a_9 using this recursive formula. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as before, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the result is consistent whether I compute each layer step by step or use a recursive formula. I can also consider whether there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've considered multiple approaches to solving this problem, and they all lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1. Then each 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each time it's wrapped by another 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, actually, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3(...) occurs. Let me see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this looks similar to the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*(3)^n. A particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. That's reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did initially, and it also gave me the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach\u2014lead to the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a recursive formula here. It seems like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation: r = 3r + 1, but wait, that's not the right approach. Wait, the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic root r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3L_p = 1 => -2L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L1 = 4. So when n=1, Ln = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524=88572. So using the formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient. But since I was able to compute each layer manually, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can determine that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: L(n) = A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, L(1) = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula: 3 * L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the 9th layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. So, let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, each time 1 + 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, and each time building up, so I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: The expression is of the form 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. So maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 +3 =4, a_2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13, a3=1+3*a2=1+39=40, etc. So each a_i =1 +3*a_{i-1}, with a1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_i = 3*a_{i-1} +1, with a1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_i. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_i -3*a_{i-1}=0, which has the solution a_i^h = C*3^i. The particular solution can be found as a constant, assuming a_i^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A =3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_i = C*3^i -1/2. Applying initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_i= (3/2)*3^i -1/2= (3^{i+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{i+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For i=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For i=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For i=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_i=(3^{i+1} -1)/2. So, for i=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the final expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*(a9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. So, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, ultimately leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...))). So each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2), up to layer9, and then multiplied by 3. So I think my computation was correct. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step: Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more efficiently. Let's define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. When n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=0: Hmm, but wait, n starts at 1. Maybe it's better to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So Layer9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let me just cross-verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, yes, each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is a term like 1 + 3*(previous term). So, this is similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is building up a geometric series. But since it's nested, it's a bit more complex. But using the recurrence relation seems to have worked well. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Yes, that all adds up. So, I think I've got the right answer here. It's always good to check using a different method, like the recurrence relation, to confirm that the result is consistent. It seems like both approaches lead to the same conclusion, so I'm pretty sure 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Layer 8: 1 +3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. Wait, 3280 is 3000 + 200 + 80 + 0. So 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some recursive formula because each layer is similar, just multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer individually. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. We have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's assume L(n) = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the same result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me denote the innermost term as S. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If we unroll the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). But unrolling it completely would result in a sum of powers of 3. Wait, perhaps if I consider each layer as a term in a series. Let me think. If I have n layers, then the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with n-1 layers inside. Wait, in our case, there are nine sets of parentheses, so n=9. So, perhaps the expression can be written as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to write it out. Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me try to expand this expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let me denote the innermost part as S1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to S9, which we've already computed as 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express E in terms of a sum.\n\nEach time, when we expand a layer, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if we expand all the layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nIf I expand this completely, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1 + 3*3))...). Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a sum where each term is 3^k.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the entire expression by expanding all the parentheses. Let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step:\n\nFirst, compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, as I did before. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and we have 9 layers, maybe the total can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see: Each time we have a 1, and then a 3 times the next layer. So, if we expand all the layers, we can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nIf we expand this, each 1 contributes to a term multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers beyond it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a geometric series where each term is 3^k, starting from k=0 up to k=9, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, when I computed each layer, the value was (3^(n+1) -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, for 9 layers, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1 = 59048 /2 = 29524, which is Layer 9. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, another way to compute this is by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, the sum after n layers would be (3^(n+1) -1)/2, as we derived earlier. So, for 9 layers, it's (3^10 -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to think if there's a way to represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see.\n\nIf I expand E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers, perhaps it's equivalent to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^9.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nEach time you expand a layer, you're adding a term. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but if I think of each 1 as contributing to a term multiplied by 3^(number of layers above it), then perhaps the total sum is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1 + 3*3))).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent it as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, let me try to write it out step by step.\n\nLet me denote the innermost term as S1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*S9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nEach time, the 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^9, the next 1 by 3^8, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^1, and then we have the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps E can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nIf I expand all the parentheses, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of times you go up a layer. Let me try to write it out:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nExpanding the innermost parentheses first:\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nWait, this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, each time you have a 1 inside the expression, it's multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, starting from the innermost 1, which is in Layer 1, it's multiplied by 3^9, because there are 9 layers above it (including itself). Wait, no, actually, each 1 is in a specific layer, and the number of times it's multiplied by 3 is equal to the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is in Layer 1, and there are 8 layers above it, so it's multiplied by 3^8. The next 1 is in Layer 2, so it's multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the 1 in Layer 9, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, when we compute E = 3*Layer9, we're effectively adding 3*29524.\n\nBut perhaps if I consider all the 1s in each layer, they each contribute 3^k to the total sum. Let me try to write this as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) ?\n\nWait, no, because each 1 is in a different layer, so the exponents would be different. Wait, perhaps E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula we derived earlier. Since each layer L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then Layer9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent E as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) - something. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^10 -1)/(3-1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly Layer9. So, Layer9 is equal to the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k. Therefore, E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the entire expression E is equal to 3 times the sum of 3^0 up to 3^9. Therefore, E = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, E = (3^11 -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's a neat formula. So, in general, for an expression with n layers, E = 3*(sum from k=0 to n of 3^k) = 3*((3^(n+1) -1)/2) = (3^(n+2) -3)/2. In our case, n=9, so E = (3^(11) -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer step by step. It's more efficient, especially if n is large.\n\nBut since I've already computed it step by step and verified it with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^11 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, yes, 3^11 is 177147. Then, 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is 3^k, from k=0 to k=9, multiplied by 3, so it's 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*((3^10 -1)/2) = (3^11 -3)/2, which again gives 88572.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles, and each method leads me to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's write it down: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4=13, which is what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. So, the recurrence is linear. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, and 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. The recurrence approach helped confirm the result without having to compute each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work fine. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in computing the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear recurrence. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So this is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572 as the final answer. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I think the recurrence method worked well here. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. Calculating each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation both yield the same result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a geometric series or something. Let me see. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate coefficients: On the left: A*3^n + B. On the right: A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Therefore, equate the terms: For 3^n: A = A, which is fine. For constants: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2 where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of this progression, we determine that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
