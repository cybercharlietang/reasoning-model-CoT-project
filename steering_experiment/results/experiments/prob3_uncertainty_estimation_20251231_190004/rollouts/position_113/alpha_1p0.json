    "text": " -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, especially since there are only nine layers.

    "text": " B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so expanding the entire expression would result in a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I expand it, it's similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I need to verify that. Wait, actually, each layer contributes a term that's multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to write it out:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I expand it, it would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, actually, let's see: Let me define S as the entire expression. Then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Notice that the inner expression is similar to S/3, but actually, it's one layer less. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and there are 9 layers, perhaps the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))). So, expanding this would give 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3 (nine times). Wait, but actually, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 3*1, then moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, when fully expanded, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^9, but how many terms? Let's see: The innermost is 3, then moving out, each term adds another power. So, the total number of terms is 9, starting from 3^1 up to 3^9, each multiplied by 1. So, S = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. That's a geometric series with first term a=3, ratio r=3, and n=9 terms. The sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n -1)/(r -1). Plugging in: S = 3*(3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = 3*(19683 -1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but earlier we had the expression as 3*a_9, which was 3*29524=88572. But according to this, S=29523, which is different. So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let me figure out where I went wrong. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I let the innermost part be 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572. But when I tried to expand it as a geometric series, I got 29523. So, perhaps the expansion isn't exactly a geometric series because each term is 1 + 3*something, not just 3^k. Wait, let's see: Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let me write out the expression without the 3 multiplier at the beginning: Let me denote E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand E, it would be 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 layers. So, E = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Because each layer adds another power of 3. So, E is the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1). So, for n=8, E = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the original expression is 3*E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but earlier I computed 3*a_9 =88572, which is different. So, which one is correct? Let me check again. Wait, I think I'm confusing the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, when I define E as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, with 9 layers, E would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 9 layers. But when I expanded it as a geometric series, I got E = sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2 =9841. Therefore, the original expression is 3*E = 3*9841=29523. But earlier, when I computed each layer step by step, I got a_9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct? Let me compute layer 9 again. Starting from layer 1: 1 +3=4 layer 2:1 +3*4=13 layer3:1 +3*13=40 layer4:1 +3*40=121 layer5:1 +3*121=364 layer6:1 +3*364=1093 layer7:1 +3*1093=3280 layer8:1 +3*3280=9841 layer9:1 +3*9841=29524 So, layer9=29524, then 3*layer9=88572. But when I expanded it as a geometric series, I got E=9841, then 3*E=29523. These are two different results. So, where is the mistake? Let me see: The confusion arises from how we define E. If E is the entire inner expression, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), with 9 layers, then E is equal to 1 + 3*E', where E' is the expression with 8 layers. But when I expanded E as a geometric series, I considered E as the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 9841. But according to the step-by-step computation, E is 29524. So, which is correct? Let me compute E for smaller layers and see. Let's take n=1: E1=1 +3=4. According to the geometric series, sum from k=0 to 0 of 3^k =1. But E1=4, which is not equal to 1. So, the geometric series approach is not matching the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the mistake is in the assumption that E is the sum of 3^k. Instead, E is defined recursively as E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}, which is different from the sum of a geometric series. So, the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula we derived earlier. Therefore, the correct value is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another expression.

So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost expression is a_9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so 9+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step.

Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some computation time, but since the number of layers is manageable, computing each step is feasible. Another way to think about it is that each layer is essentially tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*previous +1. Let me check that: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 3*4 +1 = 13 Layer 3: 3*13 +1 = 40 Layer 4: 3*40 +1 = 121 Layer 5: 3*121 +1 = 364 Layer 6: 3*364 +1 = 1093 Layer 7: 3*1093 +1 = 3280 Layer 8: 3*3280 +1 = 9841 Layer 9: 3*9841 +1 = 29524 Yes, same as before.

So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which we can compute as (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That matches.
