Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.

Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 first: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is layer 9, would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 =88572.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations.

Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as each layer being a term in a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the total would be a geometric series with ratio 3. But given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step is straightforward. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply by 3 again to get the final result. So, step by step, each layer is: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.

Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.

So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which according to the formula is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. Then, Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me verify 3^{10} is indeed 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, multiplied by 3 is 88572. So, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)...))). Each time, it's a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to the next. But since it's finite with 9 layers, the step-by-step approach works well. Alternatively, using the formula we derived, it's much faster. So, either way, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
