    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that might help. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting, the numbers are growing quickly. Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, Layer 4 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). So, Layer 5 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, moving on. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5). So, Layer 6 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's a big number. Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6). So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Thus, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7). So, Layer 8 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, Layer 9 is the outermost one: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just quickly verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, maybe I should compute Layer 1, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply the final result by 3. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... Let me compute that. 9841 * 3. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, it's increasing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each step involves taking the result from the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving to the next layer. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's not exactly the same because each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Alternatively, it might be a form of a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me think about that. If I denote L(n) as Layer n, then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test that. At n = 1: L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can set up the equation 3A + B = 4. But since it's a homogeneous recurrence, I think the particular solution might just be a constant. Let me try to find A and B. Wait, actually, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, the particular solution should be a constant. Let's assume L(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So the general solution would be L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L(1) = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is given by L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9: L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to make sure, let me recap: Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 4. Using the recurrence relation, I found a general formula for Layer n, which confirmed the step-by-step computation. Then, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives the result. So, yeah, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Adding 1 gives 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Adding 1 gives 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: I can break it down as 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like it's following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, each is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find a_9 directly.\n\nGiven that, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that to see if it's the same.\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, another way to compute the entire expression is to recognize the pattern, derive the formula, and then compute it directly.\n\nBut since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, I think that's a solid approach, especially if I wasn't sure about the pattern at first.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using this, we determine the value of each layer until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Next, Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Then, Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, 3*1 is 3, so 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Now, Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Next, Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Now, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check 3*29524 again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, looking again, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me confirm: The entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there's 1 + 3*(...), which would be Layer 1. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward, so I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Therefore, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3). That would be 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. If I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n, that might save time. The recursive formula is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers to make sure it's correct. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 =88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recursive formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, when I count the parentheses, it's 1 + 3(...), and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each layer wraps around the previous one. So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc. So, there are 9 layers in total. So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time substituting the previous layer's result into the next one. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, okay, so each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, Layer 5 would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to break it down digit by digit. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. But wait, let me verify my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add digit by digit:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's the same as before. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised because each layer was tripling and adding one, so it's growing exponentially, which makes the final number quite large. But given the structure of the problem, that seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series but in a nested form. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a structure.\n\nIn general, for such nested expressions, if we have something like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, there's a formula for the nth term. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula, so maybe I should try to find a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote L_k as the value of the kth layer. Then, the recurrence is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4 (since the innermost layer is 1 + 3). Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so L_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.\n\nSo, we have L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent with what I computed earlier.

So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.

So, let's compute each layer step by step. **Layer 1:** The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. **Layer 2:** Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. **Layer 3:** Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. **Layer 4:** Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 equals 121. **Layer 5:** Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. **Layer 6:** Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 equals 1093. **Layer 7:** Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Hmm, let me compute that: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. **Layer 8:** Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me calculate that: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. **Layer 9:** Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 equals 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check a couple of the layers again. Let's check Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. How about Layer 5: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) Let's compute that step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. So, yes, Layer 5 is 364. Okay, that seems consistent. Maybe I can also compute Layer 7 again: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))) Let's break it down from the inside: 1 + 3 = 4. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. That's correct. Okay, so all the layers seem to be computed correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer step by step, but breaking it down made it manageable. I just had to remember to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, computing each layer one at a time. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next one until you get to the outermost part. This methodical approach helped me avoid mistakes and ensured that each step was correct before moving on to the next.

Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 1 + 3(Layer 2)), but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each innermost expression first. Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Continuing this way, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Next, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Now, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. I can break this down: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the value of Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with repeated patterns.

Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me verify that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, maybe another way to check is by using the formula for a geometric series or something, but considering the nested structure, it's a bit different. Alternatively, I can compute each layer again to ensure consistency. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3 = 88572. Okay, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nMoving on to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... Hmm, let me compute that. 9841 * 3. Let me do that step by step: 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523, which is 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Layer 9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 60 is 88,560; 88,560 + 12 is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because 29,524 * 3: 29,524 times 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, 3*(Layer 9) is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which again matches our previous result.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without having to calculate each layer individually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that there's a formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or using the closed-form solution from the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation, we find the final result to be:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, no, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), but each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's list them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Perhaps there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is Layer n = a*Layer n-1 + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nThe standard formula for such a recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = a^n * (Layer 0) + (a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1) * b\n\nBut wait, in our case, Layer 1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So maybe Layer 0 would be 1, as if there were no layers? Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, let's model this properly. Let's define Layer 1 as 1 + 3*(Layer 0), where Layer 0 is 1. So Layer 1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So in this case, the recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 0 = 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = (3^n) * Layer 0 + (3^(n) - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1\n\nSimplify that:\n\nLayer n = 3^n * 1 + (3^n - 1)/2\n\nSo Layer n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n= (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2\n\n= (3*3^n - 1)/2\n\n= (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check this formula with n=1:\n\nLayer 1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^(1+1) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works! Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSince we have Layer 9, that would be:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2=29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(Layer 9), and since Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo that's another way to look at it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The expression can be seen as a geometric series with ratio 3, multiplied by 3 each time, starting from 1.\n\nBut I think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n3. Verify the calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. Identify the recurrence relation and derive a formula to compute the nth layer.\n\n5. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer, then multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\n6. Cross-verify using an alternative approach (geometric series) to ensure consistency.\n\nSo, after all these steps, I'm confident that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me confirm that: Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another (1 + 3(...)). So, let's list each layer and compute them step by step. Let me write them down:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but looking back at the original problem, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So I think I made a mistake in my earlier thought process. Let me correct that. The original problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, each layer is inside another layer, and the outermost operation is multiplying the entire expression by 3. So, if I compute Layer 1 to Layer 9 as I did before, the final result would be 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but in my earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, so then the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Layer 9 was 29524, so the total expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with (1 + 3(...)), so I think I did nine layers correctly.\n\nBut wait, let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...)\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and Layer 9 is the outermost (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation seems correct, leading to 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again because 88,572 seems quite a big number, and I might have made a multiplication error somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, 3*29524: Let's compute this carefully.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, giving a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier calculation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recursive formula and the closed-form expression both lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula gives a_n as the value at each layer. So, for the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and each time, it's 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each layer is defined as 1 + 3*previous_layer, and we have nine such layers, with the outermost being multiplied by 3.\n\nYes, so both methods confirm that the result is 88,572. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking back, the very outermost expression is 3 times (Layer 9), so maybe I should consider that as Layer 10? Hmm, perhaps. But maybe it's better to just work from the inside out, regardless of labels. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 first, which is 3000, then 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 first, which is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 first, which is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the right answer. Let me just visualize the entire process again to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nBut in this case, since I only have nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable, and I've already done that.\n\nAlternatively, I might think about whether there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if that holds with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3, so it's (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} is 177147. Then, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on, I should be able to get the final answer. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*120 first, which is 360, and then 3*1 is 3, so total is 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88,572. I don't see any errors in my steps, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, perhaps starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), and then moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Innermost Layer (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, we have Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me continue this process step by step. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, the entire expression is 3 times that value. So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Wait, let me check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3 times (Layer 9), but Layer 9 is 1 + 3(Layer 8). So, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe it's better to compute each layer starting from the innermost one. Let's try that. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9. So, L1 is the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on until L9. After that, the entire expression is 3*L9. Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, so the outermost is 3*(L9). Let me confirm that. Let's see: The innermost is L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Yes, that seems right. So, I can compute L1 to L9 step by step. Let's start computing each layer one by one. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. So, the entire expression equals 88,572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from L1 to L9: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving it that way. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to L1=4. So, L_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C - 1/2 =4. Solving for C: 3C =4 +1/2= 9/2. So, C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a term in a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But in this case, since the nesting is only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. However, it's good to know that there's a formula for such nested expressions, which can save time for larger numbers of layers. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the solution of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outwards. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 equals 40. Therefore, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 equals 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 equals 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 equals 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60.\n\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each layer was computed correctly, right?\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something? Because each layer seems to be a repetition of multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is reminiscent of a geometric progression.\n\nLet me consider that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each time, we have a term that is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have nine layers, so a_9 is the innermost term, and each subsequent layer is built on top of that. But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result after nine layers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the entire expression would be 3*f(9).\n\nLet me compute f(n) for n from 1 to 9:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a nonhomogeneous one because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe general solution to such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1\n\nSo, A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, that's f(n) = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nf(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nf(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nf(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\nf(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 =9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*29524 once again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n2 (units place)\n\n7 (tens place)\n\n7 (hundreds place)\n\n5 (thousands place)\n\n7 (ten thousands place)\n\n8 (hundred thousands place)\n\n8 (millions place)\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be correct because 29524 is a five-digit number.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigit positions: Ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nSo:\n\n2 (ten thousands)\n\n9 (thousands)\n\n5 (hundreds)\n\n2 (tens)\n\n4 (units)\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the units:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572, which is a six-digit number: 8 (hundred thousands), 8 (ten thousands), 5 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). Wait, no, hold on, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, when I multiply 29524 by 3, the result should be 88572.\n\nLet me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, when I count the parentheses, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), but each time, the next layer is inside the previous one. So, actually, the innermost is Layer 9, and then each layer wraps around the previous one. Let me clarify that. Let's consider each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 1, which is the outermost: 3*(Layer 2)\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something). That something is 1 + 3*(another something). So, if I label the innermost part as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(Layer n). Hmm, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward, calculating each layer step by step. Let's try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so perhaps the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around, so Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the innermost. But actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step, moving outward.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check that again. Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, if Layer 9 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps around, so Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), etc., up to Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). But then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). Wait, that might be a confusion. Let me try to structure this correctly.\n\nLet me consider the original expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's count the number of layers. Each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first is 3*(...), then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's count how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression has 3*(...), and inside that, each time, another 3*(...), so the number of layers is 9, because each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), and there are 9 such layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, no, actually, let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3*(...) parts. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so the innermost is (1 + 3), and each layer up to the 9th layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, let's compute that.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3.\n\nLet's do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication another way. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3*(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another ( after the first 3: total 2\n3. Then another ( after that: total 3\n4. Continuing until we reach the ninth (.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a new (1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n(1 + 3) is the first innermost.\n\nThen each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so total layers would be 9, as we have nine sets of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, yes, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. Let me count the number of times I have 1 + 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so total of nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the computation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let's see:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolve for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say n=0 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. If we consider the innermost layer as n=1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, using n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Let me see.\n\nThe innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, n=9 layers, with a_9 being the innermost? Wait, no, actually, in the recurrence, n=1 is the innermost, and n=9 would be the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me think. The innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_9\n\nSo, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here. The formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives the value after n layers, starting from the innermost. So, in our case, n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each layer being a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in any case, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same result.\n\nSo, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we found that each layer's value is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives us 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the innermost value is 29,524. Multiplying this by the outermost factor of 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), with nine layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. **Multiply by Outermost Factor:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, let me compute each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. So, Layer 6 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093. Let me figure that out: 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. So, Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280. Calculating that: 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. So, Layer 8 is 9,841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841. Let me compute 3*9,841: 9,841 * 3. Let me do that step by step: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9,841 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29,524. Let me do that: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 60 is 88,560; 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1,093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1,093=3,280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3,280=9,841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9,841=29,524, correct. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, maybe we can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, that seems a bit odd, but okay. So, the general solution is L_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Let's solve for C: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me write that as L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with my initial step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. If I expand it all the way, how many terms would there be? Let's see: Each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). If I expand it all the way, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Since there are nine layers, the innermost term is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, when expanded, it would be a sum of 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, up to 3^9, plus some constants. Wait, let me think. Alternatively, using the formula for a geometric series: The expression inside the parentheses, if fully expanded, would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Because each layer adds another power of 3. Let me check: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13. But 13 can be written as 1 + 3 + 9. Wait, 1 + 3*4=1 + 12=13. Alternatively, 1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=13. Similarly, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(13)=1 + 39=40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40. So, each layer adds another term of 3^n. Therefore, after nine layers, the innermost expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. So, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 6,561 (which is 3^8). The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where r is the common ratio, which is 3 here, and n is the number of terms. Here, n=9 terms because we start from 3^0=1 up to 3^8. So, S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19,683 -1)/2=19,682/2=9,841. Wait, but earlier, Layer 8 was 9,841. Hmm, that's interesting. So, Layer 8 is 9,841, which is equal to the sum S =1 +3 +9 + ... +3^8=9,841. Then, Layer 9 is 1 +3*S=1 +3*9,841=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*29,524=88,572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3)...))), with nine layers, it's equivalent to 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) + something? Wait, no, because each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, when fully expanded, it's a sum of 3^1 +3^2 +...+3^9. Wait, let me clarify. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step. The innermost term is 1 +3=4. Then, moving out, it's 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1,093. Then, 1 +3*1,093=3,280. Then, 1 +3*3,280=9,841. Then, 1 +3*9,841=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. So, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But in this case, it's being nested, so each layer is 1 +3*(previous). So, the total expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1 +3)...))). So, if I consider the innermost part, it's 1+3=4. Then, each layer is 1 +3*previous. So, as I calculated earlier, each layer is 4,13,40,121,364,1,093,3,280,9,841,29,524. Then, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives 88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, is there a formula for such nested expressions? It seems similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, perhaps the closed-form formula I derived earlier applies here. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=59,049-1=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula give the same result.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (no inner parentheses) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So far, so good. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, let's compute that: Total = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 52 * 3 = 156 + 7 = 163, write down 3 and carry over 16. 95 * 3 = 285 + 16 = 301, write down 1 and carry over 30. 2 * 3 = 6 + 30 = 36. So, putting it all together: 36,132. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Wait a minute, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my initial breakdown. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should write it out more carefully. 29,524 \u00d7 3: Starting from the right: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it out: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. Okay, that matches the second method. So, I must have messed up my initial digit-by-digit calculation. It's easy to make a mistake when doing it mentally. So, the correct total is 88,572. Let me just recap the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1,093 Layer 7: 3,280 Layer 8: 9,841 Layer 9: 29,524 Then, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, let me verify the layers again to be thorough. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572. So, all the layers seem to compute correctly. I think I might have just made a mistake in my initial multiplication when I was trying to do it quickly in my head. So, the correct answer should be 88,572. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern that could have saved me some time instead of computing each layer step by step. Hmm, the expression is a nested multiplication, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the Layer 9 value we computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula saved me from computing each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad either. It's good to know multiple methods to solve a problem because it can help verify the answer and also makes the solution more robust. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which equals 88,572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Write down 8.\nThe next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is the ten-thousands place), but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so when multiplied by 3:\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12.

Write 8.\nNo more digits, but we have a carryover of 2? Wait, no, because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the 2 (ten-thousands place), there are no more digits. So, we should have:\n\nWait, 29524 is 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, starting from units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7, carryover 0.\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15. Hundreds place: 5, carryover 1.\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place: 8, carryover 2.\n2 (ten-thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo, writing it out, the result is 88572. Wait, let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct because 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524 = ?\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out. So, I think I did it correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, when you have nested expressions like this, there's a geometric series or some recursive formula you can use. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence relation can be solved using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric series. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k - 1)) * k^{n - 1} - c/(k - 1). Wait, no, maybe I should derive it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Which matches Layer 1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches Layer 2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result without manually calculating each layer. That's a good cross-verification.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a geometric progression, the total expression can be seen as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and then compute the entire expression. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, the expression has nine layers, but each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the way I carried over. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, no carryover.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, no carryover.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, I should have:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n9*3=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n5*3=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\nWait, but 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo when I multiply by 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens place:7\n5*3=15 \u2192 hundreds place:5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands place:8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands place:8\n\nWait, that's only five digits, so the result should be 88572, which is 6 digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\n2 (from 4*3)\n7 (from 2*3 +1)\n5 (from 5*3 +1)\n8 (from 9*3 +2)\n8 (from 2*3 +2)\nand then, since we've reached the highest digit, we have 2*3=6 +2=8, but wait, that's the ten thousands place. So the result is 88572. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as:\n\n29524 *3 = (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's another way to compute it, and it also gives 88572. So that checks out.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I arrived at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was simple enough. Now Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting a bit bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, this is growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 I can see a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time after 3, there's another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then that's wrapped in another 1 + 3(...), and so on.

So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, maybe I should start computing from Layer 1 and work my way up. Let me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 24 * 3 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my calculations step by step because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the layers because I might have messed up one of the layers earlier.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing it another way, maybe using a different approach or checking if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for the first few layers. So, using this formula, we can compute L_n directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nGiven that the original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, let's compute L_9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nFirst, compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've verified it thoroughly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\]\nwith \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\nComputing each layer step by step:\n- Layer 1: \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation:\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\nFor \\( n = 9 \\):\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nThus, the entire expression is:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, this is growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty large, but considering each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it makes sense that the numbers would grow exponentially. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Finally, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so each step checks out. I think I did this correctly. So, the final result is 88572. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have gotten me to this number without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. First, find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Yep, it works! So, using this formula, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 result is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13.

So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3 another way: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't match 88572. Wait, let me do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, no, when you write it down, it's 88572. Wait, but when I did the digit by digit, I thought it was 88572. Let me confirm:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it out, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So, the number is 88572. So, yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each layer built upon the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gave me 88572. So, I feel confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer, each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n4. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(result of layer 9).\n5. Finally, multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost part before the initial 3 is multiplied. Wait, but in the given problem, after the initial 3, there are eight more layers inside, right? Let me check: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... eight times... )))) So, actually, after the initial 3, there are eight layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me recount. Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's nine opening parentheses, but I think each opening corresponds to a layer, so maybe there are nine layers in total. Wait, no, the initial 3 is outside, then each 1 + 3(...) adds a layer. Let me try to parse it more carefully.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3(\n1 + 3\n)))))))))))\n\nWait, actually, when I count the closing parentheses, I see that there are nine closing parentheses after the initial 3. So that would mean that the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around that. So, perhaps it's nine layers. Let me confirm by writing each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3(L1)\n\nL3 = 1 + 3(L2)\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nThen, the entire expression would be 3(L9). So, I need to compute L1 through L9 and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nOkay, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nFirst, compute L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24?\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 29,524. Let me compute 3*29,524.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the layers.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nWait, this expression seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4.\n\nSo, L1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is L_n = a^{n} * (L0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, but in our case, L1 is the first term, so maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nLet me see: The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n >= 2, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n = 1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 5: L5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 6: L6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 7: L7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 8: L8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n = 9: L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach, verified the results, and everything checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Using this recurrence relation, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThen, multiply by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let's calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems to be correct.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572, so adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value should be 88,572. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my steps. Each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by substituting the previous result and multiplying by 3 before adding 1. This process is repeated until the outermost layer is reached, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, each time substituting the value from the previous layer. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, that's bigger. Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wow, it's growing quickly. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 121? That's interesting. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, so it's definitely increasing exponentially. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's a big jump. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so let me compute that: Total = 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Finally, the 2 at the beginning times 3 is 6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Millions place: The leading 2 is actually the ten-thousands place in 29524, right? Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, the digits are:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 *3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the total is 88572. Wait, but let me check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 +3*121=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 +3*364=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 +3*1093=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 +3*3280=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, to find a_9, we can write a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >=2,\n\nwith a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. So, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer: 1 +3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 +3*(previous). So, it's like a geometric progression with ratio 3. But because each term is 1 +3*(previous), it's similar to a geometric series but with an added 1 each time. Hmm, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, the entire expression can be considered as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But perhaps the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward.\n\nAnother way is to recognize that the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where inside the parentheses, there are eight more layers. Let me denote the inner expression as T, so S = 3*(1 + 3*T). But T itself is similar to S but with one fewer layer. So, T = 3*(1 + 3*(... )). Wait, but this might complicate things because each time you go one layer in, you have to subtract a layer. Maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recurrence relation.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. After computing all nine layers, we find the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(...) where the ... is Layer 1 Layer 3: 1 + 3(...) where the ... is Layer 2 and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times something), so each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1. Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward, each time substituting the inner expression with its computed value. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12, so adding those up: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, 3*4 is 12. Wait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Let me break it down differently. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, carry over 2. 5*3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 3*3 is 9. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carries. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n3 * 3 = 9, write down 9.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3. Let me compute it more carefully.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Wait, no, the next digit is 5? Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So when multiplying by 3, let's go step by step:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my steps because this seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable.\n\nWait a second, let me think if there's a pattern here that could be generalized. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. Wait, but in our case, the first term a_1 is 4, which is when n=1. So, perhaps the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} + (something). Let me try to find the closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute this using the closed-form formula, I could have directly computed a_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2 and then multiplied by 3. That would have saved time, but since I was working through it step by step, the manual computation was a good exercise.\n\nI think I've got it right. Let me just recap:\n\n- The expression is a nested multiplication starting with 3*(1 + 3*(...)) nine times.\n\n- Each layer can be computed by starting from the innermost and working outwards.\n\n- Each layer n is given by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\n- Using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives a_9 = 29524.\n\n- Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Let me check that again. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). The innermost part is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3. Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, so yeah, that seems correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's keep going.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*(29524). Let's compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break this down. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Let me confirm this multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series because each layer is being multiplied by 3 each time. Maybe there's a formula I can apply here to compute it more efficiently without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the expression. It's of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(next term). Let's denote each term as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, and then the total is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, using this formula, I can compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this in terms of exponents:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it.\n\nI think this confirms that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n3. Notice that each layer follows a recurrence relation.\n4. Derive a general formula for the nth layer using the recurrence relation.\n5. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer directly.\n6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n7. Verify the result using an alternative method (expressing as a geometric series).\n\nThis approach ensures that I didn't make any mistakes in the step-by-step computation and that the answer is consistent regardless of the method used.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each time you have 1 + 3*(something), it's similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, since each term is multiplied by 3, it's similar to a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but with each term also adding 1. However, since the additions are nested, it's a bit more complicated than a simple geometric series.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and the repeating pattern. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. Compute each layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nWe also verified the result using a general formula for the nth layer, which confirmed the result.\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, maybe that's a better way to think about it. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so adding those together: 300 + 60 = 360, 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding them together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let's calculate that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do that:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 88572. Wait, that's what I got earlier. So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me double-check because 29524*3=88572. Alternatively, I can compute 30000*3=90000, and subtract 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428=88572. That confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, but let me just go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps because that seems like a big number. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, if the expression was only two layers deep: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Let's compute that. Innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Now, let's do three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, the pattern holds. Therefore, it's likely that the nine-layer version is correctly computed as 88572. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer starting from the innermost, we find that each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one, leading to the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost part, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Thus, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Therefore, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those together: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding these up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding these together: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in breaking down 29524. Let me try another approach: 3*29524. I can compute 29524*3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So putting it together: 6 (from 2*3), 8 (from 9*3 +2), 8 (from 5*3 +1), 7 (from 2*3 +1), and 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, but when I did it earlier, I had 60000 +27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 72=88572. So that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(...) where ... is Layer 1 Layer 3: 1 + 3(...) where ... is Layer 2 ... and so on up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, when I count the parentheses, I think there are nine layers. Let me check: Starting from the innermost, each time I see a (1+3(...)), so yes, nine layers. So, I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might work. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carryover 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carryover 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carryover 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, carryover 2. 5*3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, carryover 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer is built upon the previous one, and starting from the innermost Layer 1, we worked our way out to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Final expression: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that all checks out. Each step seems correct, and the calculations for each layer look accurate. So, I feel confident that the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was simple.

Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Since there are nine layers, I'll compute each starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the final result by 3 as per the original expression. Let's get started.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so 3*4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4).

Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carry 0.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it digit by digit above, I thought it was 88572, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me go through the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all layers check out. I think that's correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost layer:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
