    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, when I count the parentheses, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me recount the layers to make sure. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is Layer 1. Then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds one more 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time there's an opening parenthesis, except for the first one, which is inside the initial 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) ... up to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Therefore, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time substituting the previous layer's result into the next one. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. So Layer 1 equals 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4: 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then add 1: 1092 +1=1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then add 1: 3279 +1=3280.\n\nLayer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then add 1: 9840 +1=9841.\n\nLayer 8: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 +1=29524.\n\nLayer 9: 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*524=1572. Wait, actually, let me break it down properly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, multiply 20000*3=60000\n\nThen 9000*3=27000\n\nThen 500*3=1500\n\nThen 24*3=72\n\nNow, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 times 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the entire expression simplifies down to 88572. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. Starting from the innermost Layer 1, each subsequent layer was computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. I went through each layer step by step, computing Layer 1 through Layer 9, and then multiplied Layer 9 by 3 to get the final result. Each step involved straightforward multiplication and addition, which I double-checked as I went along. I also double-checked the final multiplication to ensure accuracy. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. But actually, looking again, I see that each layer is multiplied by 3 at the end. Wait, no, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Let me parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression). So, the structure is like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Hmm, maybe I should work from the inside out, computing each innermost expression first. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9841*3. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, actually, the innermost is just 1 + 3, right? Because the next layer would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, but then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost part, we go back to the outermost layer. Wait, no, actually, the way the expression is structured, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, actually, the expression is built from the innermost to the outermost. So, let me correct that. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, moving outward, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3. Let's compute each part: 20000*3=60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 +12=88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might miss a digit or miscount. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 directly: 29524 *3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without going through each layer manually. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula for the linear recurrence. This confirms that the result is indeed 88572. I think this is solid because both methods\u2014iterative computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the innermost value becomes 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so perhaps the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, and so on until Layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3. So, maybe I should compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's define each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then the final result is 3*(Layer 9). Okay, that makes sense. So, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a big number. Let me break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, we need to compute 3 * 29524. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, but wait, no, I think I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\nThere are no more digits, but we have a carryover of 0, so we're done.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it earlier, I thought 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut let me just double-check each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps, because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Ln^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, using this formula, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually, which is much more efficient, especially if there are many layers.\n\nNow, since the problem has 9 layers, L9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524=88572, as we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L9, which is (3^10 -1)/2, so 3^10 is 59049, so L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method used, the result is the same.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the formula approach yield the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. So, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost Layer 1 and moving outward, each time substituting the result into the next layer. Let me try that. Let's define each layer step by step. Let me write each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Starting with the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3*(1) because the innermost is 1 + 3, right? Wait, no, wait. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, so L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So L2 = 13. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. L3 = 40. Next, L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. L4 = 121. Then, L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. L5 = 364. Moving on, L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. L6 = 1093. Next, L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. L7 = 3280. Now, L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. L8 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

That seems manageable. Let me write down each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a jump. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding these: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The standard form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n-1}. Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}. Let me verify this formula. When r \u2260 1, the solution is indeed a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}. So, in our case, c = 1, r = 3, a_1 = 4. Plugging these into the formula: a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1}. Simplifying: 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Then, 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, a_n = (-1/2) + (9/2)*3^{n-1}. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n = 1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n = 2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n = 3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, matches Layer 3. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n = 9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let me compute this. First, 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let me compute 9*6561: 6000*9=54,000; 500*9=4,500; 60*9=540; 1*9=9. Adding them up: 54,000 + 4,500 = 58,500; 58,500 + 540 = 59,040; 59,040 + 9 = 59,049. So, (9/2)*6561 = 59,049 / 2 = 29,524.5. Then, subtracting 1/2: 29,524.5 - 0.5 = 29,524. So, a_9 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this method also gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the formula for the linear recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I don't think I made a mistake here. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer, but since the expression is finite and has only nine layers, it's manageable. If it had been more layers, I would have definitely used the formula to find the nth term without computing each one individually. But for nine layers, it's doable manually. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure at first, I started with the step-by-step approach, which worked out fine. In summary, the key was to recognize the nested structure and compute each layer starting from the innermost one, then build up the solution step by step. Using the recurrence relation formula was a good way to verify the result as well. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but actually, when I look again, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a trend. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, the result is 88,572.

Yes, that seems right. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each layer again to ensure there's no arithmetic error.

Hmm, actually, looking again, the outermost expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, then multiply the result by 3, I should get the final answer. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so that's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). That's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). That's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that means there are nine layers. So, to compute this, I need to compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and so on until Layer 9, and then multiply the entire expression by the outermost 3.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems quite large, but let me verify my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nLet me double-check each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nWe have:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and the particular solution is found by assuming a constant solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, we can solve it as follows.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1. The solution to this is Ln = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*Ln, where n=9.\n\nSo, 3*Ln = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially in the final multiplication.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed using the result of the previous layer, leading to the final value. Using a step-by-step approach or recognizing the pattern allows us to find the solution efficiently.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by the outermost 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, but actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer, so maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Hmm, this seems to be growing quickly. Let me write down each layer as I compute it to keep track.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original problem is 3 times the entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, I have to multiply that result by 3. Let me make sure I understand the structure correctly. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7         3\n\n------------\n\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let's go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the outermost multiplication by 3 is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3 times the entire expression, which is the 9th layer. So, yes, that would be 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Hmm, perhaps it's better to count the number of nested expressions. Alternatively, maybe the total number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances before the first closing parenthesis. So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute each a_n step by step up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me recompute a_5 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nAnd then 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be thorough.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, verifying each computation, and even deriving a closed-form formula to confirm the result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, looking again, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by a sum where the second term is another 3 times a similar expression. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost Layer 1, compute that, then plug it into Layer 2, and so on, until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply by 3. Let me try that approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28. 2*3 is 6, plus the carried over 2 is 8. So, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let's do it step by step: 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88,572. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I computed the next layer by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me check a couple of layers to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. That's correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wait, no, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me check Layer 8 again because 3*9841 is 29,523, and adding 1 gives 29,524. Then, 3*29,524: 29,524 \u00d7 3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572 is correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That confirms it. So, all the layers seem to compute correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident with this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (This is the innermost part, but wait, actually, the innermost is just 1 + 3, right? But looking again, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(...)\". Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is the 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 3 times something. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so let's see: 1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 2. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 3. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 4. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 5. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 6. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 7. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 8. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 9. 3(1 + 3( ... )) Wait, but actually, each layer is 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, but wait, no, the innermost is 1 + 3, but then each layer is 3 times that. Wait, perhaps I should write this out step by step. Let me try to compute each layer starting from the innermost. So, let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, where E9 is the outermost expression. Wait, actually, let me think. The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is E1. Then, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(E1), which is E2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(E2) = E3, and so on until E9. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, but let me check that. So, E1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(E1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the next is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, E4 would be 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(E9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing E9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. So, the final answer would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each E step by step again.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Thus, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Thus, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27,000, 3*800=2,400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, E9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(E9) = 3*29,524. Let's compute that again: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29,524 *3 another way to be sure. 29,524 *3 can be broken down as (30,000 - 476) *3 = 30,000*3 - 476*3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n^{(h)} = 3*E_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4. So, when n=1, E_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computations to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, E9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can also cross-verify by computing a few more layers using the formula to ensure consistency. For example, E10 would be (3^{11} -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573, but that's beyond our problem. So, in our case, with E9 = 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me calculate 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Okay, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3, so adding those together: 300 + 60 = 360, plus 3 is 363. So, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. Let's break it down: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's get started. **Layer 1:** The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We know Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** Now, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** Next, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** Continuing outward, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Hmm, 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** Finally, the outermost layer before the initial 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, maybe I should do it more straightforwardly. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost expression and working up to the outermost. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), and the entire expression is then multiplied by 3. \n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's see, 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so total is 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should write it down:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   -----------\n     8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it's 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding those together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+60=88,560; 88,560+12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I can check a few layers again.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a geometric series or a recursive formula that can be used. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3.\n\nTherefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 =1 +2A => A= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=4.5=9/2.\n\nThus, C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let's see.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, that's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but actually, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so maybe I should consider that as the final step after computing Layer 9. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nNow, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then +123 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, that gives 88572. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used a different approach, maybe recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's see for n=1: a_1 should be 4. Plugging into the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 should be 13. The formula gives (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Which matches our earlier computation. So, yes, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 /2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value we got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led to the same answer. So, I'm pretty confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1.

Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, perhaps I should compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and so on until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply that by 3 to get the final answer. Let me test this approach. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's interesting. Layer 4 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, so each layer seems to be growing quite quickly. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Hmm, I'm not sure I see an obvious pattern yet, but let's keep computing a few more layers to see if something emerges. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Thus, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems consistent. Each layer was correctly computed step by step, and the final multiplication by 3 also looks correct. So, I think the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we evaluate each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and keep going, I should be able to find the value of the entire expression. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was straightforward. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

So, let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an error with so many layers. Let me go back and check each layer quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually, especially since the expression is quite nested. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent as well. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, then divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to see it. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer. But since the problem is only nine layers deep, manually computing each layer isn't too bad, but for more layers, the formula would be useful. Anyway, so the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(...) where the ... is Layer 1 Layer 3: 1 + 3(...) where the ... is Layer 2 And so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part. Wait, actually, looking back, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so maybe I should consider each multiplication by 3 as a separate step. Let me try to parse the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives the next layer's value. Let me try to formalize this. Let me define each layer as follows: Let me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 E_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 E_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, after computing E_9, which is the outermost expression inside the multiplication by 3, we have the entire expression as 3*E_9. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with E_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. E_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. E_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. E_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. E_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. E_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. E_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I can check this using another method or perhaps look for a pattern or formula that might represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each E_n follows a recurrence relation: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for E_n. Let's see: The recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's similar to expanding a base-3 number or something, but I think the recurrence is the most direct way here. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer's value).\n\nFollowing this step-by-step expansion:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9's value:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but actually, the first term inside is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work our way out, calculating each step as we go. Let me try that. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1092 +1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 +1 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 +1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 +1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Wait, actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, let me start by computing Layer 1 first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.

Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Alright, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, that's 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3 is 1,092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Got it, Layer 6 is 1,093. Next, Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093. 1,093*3: 1,000*3 is 3,000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3,000 + 270 is 3,270, plus 9 is 3,279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Layer 7 is 3,280. Now, Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280. Calculating 3*3,280: 3,000*3 is 9,000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Thus, Layer 8 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. So, Layer 8 is 9,841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841. Let me compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524*3: 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524, correct. Finally, 3*29,524 = 88,572, correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that my answer is correct. I think I've solved it!\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost part, multiplied by 3. So, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Let me compute that: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Wow, this is growing quickly. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes: 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up:\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29,524 + 29,524. 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, 9 + 9 = 18, 2 + 2 = 4. So, that's 59,048. Now, add 59,048 + 29,524. Let's add these:\n\n59,048 + 29,524. \n\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write down 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, we get 88,572. Yes, that's the same as before. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think I did it right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, so I can verify it another way.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where n goes from 1 to 9. Then, the recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, the nonhomogeneous term is 1. Let me write the recurrence as:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f matches Layer 1.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f matches Layer 2.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f matches Layer 3.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Good.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, let me just check that calculation again for 3^11. 3^10 is 59,049, so 59,049 *3: 59,049 * 3.\n\nCompute 59,049 * 3:\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n\n0*3=0 +1=1, write down 1.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nBut wait, 59,049 is a 5-digit number: 5 9 0 4 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 59,049 *3:\n\n59,049 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, write 4, carry 1.\n\n0*3=0 +1=1, write 1.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n\nBut wait, that's only 5 digits. So, after the 5 digits, we have the carryover 1, which becomes the sixth digit.\n\nSo, 59,049 *3 = 177,147.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^11 is 177,147.\n\nThen, (177,147 -3)/2 = (177,144)/2 = 88,572. Perfect.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which confirms that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240, so 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24. Calculating each part: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, and 3*24 = 72. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a common pattern in geometric series. Wait a minute, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression? Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently. But since I was already calculating each layer step by step, it's good to confirm that both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 72=88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, when I count the parentheses, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let me correct that: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9. But actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each next layer is 1 + 3 times that. So, maybe I should start by computing Layer 1 first, then use that result in Layer 2, and so on. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again to confirm: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that's another way to check. So, both methods give me 88,572.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's get started. **Layer 1:** The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Therefore, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = let's see, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Hmm, let's compute that: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems to be correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. The final multiplication by 3 at the end also seems right. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems a bit off because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Let me check again.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Let's add these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. As above, 29524*3=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step in another way. Alternatively, notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But a_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved as follows: The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have Layer 9, that would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Finally, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, moving on.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down.

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first, which is 39. So, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a jump. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Thus, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Therefore, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Therefore, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*524=1572. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers.

Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and each time, I substituted the computed value of the inner layer into the outer one. It's a bit tedious, but since the expression is repetitive, this systematic approach works.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let's get started. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3(Layer 1) We already know Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3(Layer 2) Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3(Layer 3) Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3(Layer 4) Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3(Layer 5) Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3(Layer 6) Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3(Layer 7) Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3(Layer 8) Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841.

Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So maybe I should think of it as Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Hmm, but let me check how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the 1, there's a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first 3, each time we have an opening parenthesis. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses inside. Wait, no, actually, each time you have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of times this happens. The main expression is 3 times (something). Then inside that something, it's 1 + 3 times another something. So, each time, you have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me see: starting from the first 3, then inside, another 3(, so that's two. Then another, so three, and so on. Let me count how many times 3( occurs. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time we have another 3(, so let's count:\n\n1. 3( at the very start\n2. Then inside, another 3(\n3. And another 3(\n4. Another 3(\n5. Another 3(\n6. Another 3(\n7. Another 3(\n8. Another 3(\n9. Then, inside that, another 3(\nWait, no, actually, the innermost part is 1+3, so let me think differently. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) and so on, up to layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can find the value. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60.\n\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Adding them step by step:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048.\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting from layer 1 to layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's try to find the closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's verify this with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works for each layer. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the numbers get big quickly, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. I didn't make any calculation errors as far as I can tell, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Using the closed-form solution for this recurrence, we determine that the value of the entire expression is \\(88572\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me calculate that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524*3:\n\n- 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent.

Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives me 39. So, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Hmm, let's do this step by step. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so let's compute that: 3*29524. Let's break this down as well. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems to be correct. For example, Layer 1: 1+3=4, Layer 2:1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer 4:1+3*40=121, Layer 5:1+3*121=364, Layer 6:1+3*364=1093, Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, I can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A = 3/2 into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation give the same result. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking again, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so maybe I should consider that as Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer is inside it. Hmm, maybe my initial labeling was off. Let me try again. The innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the innermost expression of the outermost multiplication by 3. Wait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, computing each step as I go. Let me try that approach. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Continuing this pattern, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3). Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 6 (from 2*3), then 8 (from 2*3 + 2 carried over), then 28 becomes 8 with 2 carried over, then 15 becomes 5 with 1 carried over, then 6 +1=7, and finally 12 becomes 2 with 1 carried over, but wait, that seems off. Maybe I should do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be thought of as (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1.\n\nThen each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so up to Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the outermost multiplication. So, yes, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, Layer 9 was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, we get Layer 9 as 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(inner expression). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1)**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part, and then finally multiply by 3. Wait, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I can compute each Layer from 1 to 9 step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to do it step by step. 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 3*4=12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nThen, 3*2=6 plus the carried 1 is 7.\n\nNext, 3*5=15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nThen, 3*9=27 plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n\nNext, 3*2=6 plus the carried 2 is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify that. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down: (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an error that propagates through all subsequent layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 again: 3*9841.\n\n3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3.\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me check if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nIn this problem, each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, we can write L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's substitute L(n) = A*3^n + C into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + C)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nC = 1 + 3C.\n\nNow, solving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works for n=1.\n\nL(1) should be 4. Plugging n=1 into the formula:\n\n(3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) should be 13. (3^(3) - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. That's a relief; it confirms that each layer's value is accurate.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L(9), and L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nThat's another way to see it. So, the expression simplifies to (3^11 - 3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I checked each layer, used the formula, and even computed the final multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers, so it's good to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost layer and compute each layer step by step.\n2. Each layer follows the formula L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting with L(1)=4.\n3. The closed-form solution for each layer is L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n4. For Layer 9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524.\n5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI feel confident that this is the correct answer after checking each step and using the formula to verify.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nEach layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1)\\) with \\(L(1) = 4\\). The closed-form solution for each layer is \\(L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\nFor Layer 9, we have:\n\n\\[ L(9) = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply this result by 3 to get the entire expression:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
