    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, actually, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so maybe I should adjust for that. Let me clarify: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and then the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as having 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, let me compute that: 3*(29524) = 88572 Wait, let me check that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems correct. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which could be more efficient, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost layer, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using exponents directly. Since each layer is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and the outermost layer is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using a formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost layer (n=9) is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's begin with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572, so adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 2*3=6. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572.

Hmm, that might be a good way to approach it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1092 plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3279 plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 9840 plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 29523 plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up to the final result. Let's get started. **Layer 1:** The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We know Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** Moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** Now, 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** Moving on, 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093. So, 3*1093. Let me compute that step by step: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, then +9 = 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** Now, 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280. So, 3*3280. Let me calculate that: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct.

Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let me compute that. 9841 times 3. Let me do this step by step: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let's go through each layer again quickly to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, especially since both methods gave me the same result. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1}\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}\\)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8}\\)\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is:\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39. So, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. So, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait a second, let me check Layer 5 again because 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364, which is correct. Then Layer 6: 3*364 is indeed 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 7: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. All steps seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 for the innermost parentheses. Therefore, for the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute the value step by step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Calculating 3*364: Let me break it down. 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.

Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. Let me check: The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(...). So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then use that result in Layer 2, and so on, I can work my way outwards. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the multiplication for Layer 9 again just to be sure. 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Maybe I can model it as such. Let's consider the general form. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. But in our case, a = 3, b = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I'll compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1. Let me get a piece of paper and jot down each layer's value as I compute it. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3 * Layer 1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3 * Layer 2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3 * Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, that's increasing quickly. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3 * Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3 * Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3 * Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3 * Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3 * Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3: 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses.

Hmm, this seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough.

Wait, actually, looking back, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, each nested within the previous one. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So, 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Hmm, 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Okay, that's 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 So, 1093.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, I can just do 29524*3. Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading the digits from right to left: 2, 8, 7, 5, 4? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, actually, let me write it down as if I'm doing multiplication:\n\n    29524\n  x    3\n  _______\n    ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct.

    "text": " 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) 3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) and so on, up to 9 layers. Wait, but actually, looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is the ninth layer. Then each layer wraps around it, so the first layer is the outermost 3*(...). Hmm, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me see if I can find another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution, a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, I have two equations: 1. 3A + B = 4 2. 9A + B = 13 Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the general formula. That gives me the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, I was able to compute each layer step by step. Alternatively, by finding a closed-form formula for the nth layer, I could compute the value directly without manually calculating each layer. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors because I double-checked each step and even used two different methods to arrive at the same answer. It's a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's get started. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Hmm, 3*40 is 120, so adding 1 gives 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572, so adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, let me check that addition again. 87000 + 1572: 87000 + 1000 = 88000, 88000 + 572 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. It's like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I can also see that each layer is growing exponentially because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is significantly larger. Let me just verify each step quickly to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f **Final Step:** 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so after double-checking each layer, I'm confident that each step is correct.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Next is Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let's calculate that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093=3279. Then, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7. Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280=9840. Then, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Hmm, that's a big multiplication. Let me break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a minute, let me verify that multiplication again because 29524 seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. So, putting it all together: 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, which is what I had before. Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n- Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n- Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 carried over is 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n- Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 7 (from the last multiplication), then 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off because the number is 29524, which is a 5-digit number. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, that gives us 88572, which matches my previous result. So, yes, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nEach step seems correct. Let me check a couple of layers again to be thorough. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Final multiplication: 3*29524=88572. Correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying my steps, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400, 29400 + 120=29520, 29520 + 3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524*3. Breaking it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because each step checks out. It's a bit tedious, but since each layer only depends on the previous one, working methodically from the inside out worked well.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

So, I can compute each layer step by step, substituting the result of each layer into the next one. Let me create a table or something to keep track of each layer's value. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180=1080 +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.

Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000=87000, 87000 + 1500=88500, 88500 +72=88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I did each step correctly. Each layer was computed by substituting the previous layer's result, and then multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Then, the outermost layer was multiplied by 3 again. No step seems to have an error, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Layer 8 is 9,841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so let's compute that: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me calculate that. 3*29,524: I can break this down as 3*29,000 + 3*524. 3*29,000 is 87,000. 3*524: Let's compute 524*3. 500*3 = 1,500. 24*3 = 72. So, 1,500 + 72 = 1,572. Now, adding 87,000 + 1,572 gives me 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. Let me check a couple of layers to see if I did that correctly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct). Then, 3*29,524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3 = 60,000. 9,000*3 = 27,000. 500*3 = 1,500. 24*3 = 72. Adding these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate.

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay. So Layer 3 is 40. Let's go to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363.

Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me calculate that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

So, I need to compute layer1 through layer9, each time substituting the previous layer's result into the next one. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with layer1: Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. Now, layer2 is 1 + 3*(layer1). Since layer1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer2: 13. Now, layer3 is 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer3: 40. Moving on to layer4: 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer4: 121. Now, layer5: 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer5: 364. Layer6: 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer6: 1093. Layer7: 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer7: 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer8: 9841. Finally, layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer9: 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times layer9. So, the original expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, compute 29524*3 digit by digit. Let's do it step by step: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 0*3=0. 0*3=0. 0*3=0. So, starting from the right: 2, 7, 5, 7, 8, then the rest zeros? Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73 =6, plus 1 carried over =7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d73=27, plus 1 carried over=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6, plus 2 carried over=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the original expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the layers. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of them, which would throw off all the subsequent results.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems solid. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula or a recursive relation that can model this expression.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r=3 and c=1 here.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nActually, for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a_0 is the initial term.\n\nBut in our case, a_1=4, so n starts at 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r).\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r) => 4 = A*r + c/(1 - r).\n\nGiven r=3 and c=1:\n\n4 = 3A + 1/(1 -3) => 4 = 3A + 1/(-2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 -3) = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches layer1.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches layer2.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches layer3.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, matches layer4.\n\nn=5: a5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, layer5.\n\nn=6: a6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, layer6.\n\nn=7: a7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, layer7.\n\nn=8: a8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, layer8.\n\nn=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, layer9.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer9 is a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the original expression is 3*a9, and a9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, we arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used two different methods to confirm the result, and both lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this pattern, we can use a formula for the nth layer: a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, but in the given expression, the innermost part is Layer 9, right? Because each time we go outward, we add another layer. Hmm, maybe I should start from Layer 1 as the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so total is 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, going back to the original expression, the entire thing is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me confirm that multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that matches. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, after computing each layer, the entire expression is 3 times the result from the outermost layer. Let me write down each step systematically.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let's see, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092.

So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times the result from Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me break that down:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12.\n\nWait, that's not the right breakdown.

It was a bit time-consuming, especially with the larger numbers, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's verify that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yep, that seems right.

So, if I compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1, and so on, I should be able to get to the final answer. Let's try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, okay. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next up is Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. Let's break it down: 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*      3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524*3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me quickly recap each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nEverything seems to check out. Each layer was computed correctly by substituting the previous layer's result. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that for a second. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which resembles a geometric series or something that can be modeled with recursion.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, the nth term would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try solving the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, Layer 2 is13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, Layer4 is121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, Layer5 is364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, Layer6 is1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, Layer7 is3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, Layer8 is9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, Layer9 is29524.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, the value at each layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as we saw earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(Layer9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nBut since the problem is given with 9 layers, which corresponds to n=9 in our formula, and each layer is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, so the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods lead us to the same result, which is 88572.\n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula seems to hold true for each layer. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(result from layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(result from layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3 times 29,000 is 87,000, and 3 times 524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 equals 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've solved it correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one, and by computing them step by step, I arrive at the final answer without getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses. It's a good reminder that even if something looks complicated at first, breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts can make it much easier to handle.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost expression and moving outward. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:  \n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but actually, the outermost operation is a 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, perhaps I should start computing from the innermost Layer 1 and work my way outwards, updating each layer as I go. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 3 is then 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 121*3: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. It's easy to slip up with so many layers. Let me verify a couple of the steps. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. That seems right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524. Let's compute this again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next. After computing all nine layers, the outermost operation multiplies the final layer's result by 3. The step-by-step evaluation leads to the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's do Layer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Let's break it down for easier computation. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially since the numbers get large quickly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think I did everything right, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help confirm my answer. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost term. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each term is defined based on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me assume that the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. So, substituting into the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's plug in the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, set the left side equal to the right side: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plug B back into the initial condition equation: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost term is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This makes me confident that my answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, especially since both methods gave me the same number. So, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Now Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Okay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, all the layers computed correctly, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step seems logical, and the numbers add up correctly. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I guess another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each one step by step was feasible.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's get started.\n\nFirst, Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNext, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so plug that in: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 equals 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 equals 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 equals 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Maybe I messed up one of the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that still gives me 88572. Maybe that's correct. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAdding the first two: 29524 + 29524. Let's do this step by step.\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n24 + 24 = 48\n\n20 + 20 = 40, plus 48 is 88. So, write down 8 and carry over 8.\n\n52 + 52 = 104, plus 8 carried over is 112. Write down 2, carry over 11.\n\n95 + 95 = 190, plus 11 carried over is 201. Write down 1, carry over 20.\n\n29 + 29 = 58, plus 20 carried over is 78. So, the sum is 59048.\n\nWait, that's 29524 * 2 = 59048. Then, adding another 29524: 59048 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7, plus 1 carried over is 8.\n\n5 + 9 = 14, write 4, carry over 1.\n\nNo more digits, so write the 1.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me write it down properly:\n\n59048\n\n+29524\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\n5 + 9 = 14 \u2192 4, carryover 1.\n\nBut wait, the digits are:\n\n5 9 0 4 8\n\n+ 2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, adding:\n\nUnits place: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nHundreds place: 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThousands place: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carryover 1.\n\nTen-thousands place: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that matches my previous calculation. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through them quickly again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\n3*Layer9: 88572\n\nYes, each layer seems to be correct. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the prior. It seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Since each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me recall: For a recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so a = 3 and b = 1. Wait, actually, it's L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, in standard form, it's L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3, b=1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * (L_0 + (b)/(a - 1)) - (b)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is L_n^p = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, say L_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3, L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572. I feel confident about this now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, looking again, the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1), and this goes on until Layer 9 is the outermost expression. But wait, in the problem, it's actually the other way around. The innermost expression is Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1. Hmm, maybe I should number them starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's number the innermost as Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9 is the outermost expression.

Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting at the innermost, each 1+3 is followed by another layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write the structure:\n\n- The innermost is Layer1: 1+3\n\n- Then Layer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\n- Layer3:1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of 1+3*(...) and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, yes, I think I did 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be the final answer.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it step by step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3:1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4:1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5:1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6:1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7:1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8:1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9:1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have (1+3(...)), so that's Layer1:1+3\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is Layer2.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is 1+3, so perhaps there are 8 layers inside the initial 3(...). Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left:\n\n- The first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...))\n\n- Inside that, the next term is 1 + 3*(...), which is the next layer.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n\nWait, but when I get to the end, the innermost is 1 + 3, not 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps the innermost is Layer1:1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers? Or 8?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time I have a \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is Layer1. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLooking at the problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another \"1+3(\" until the outermost. So, how many \"1+3(\" are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, so that's Layer1:1+3.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another \"1+3(\", which adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost 1+3, each time we go outward, we have another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer1: 1+3\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n2. Layer2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\n3. Layer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n4. Layer4:1+3(Layer3)\n\n5. Layer5:1+3(Layer4)\n\n6. Layer6:1+3(Layer5)\n\n7. Layer7:1+3(Layer6)\n\n8. Layer8:1+3(Layer7)\n\n9. Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me check if I have 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to visualize the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem, after the initial 3*(, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears, which is 8 times, because the innermost is 1 + 3 without another \"1 + 3(\" after it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to count the number of layers by looking at the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times do we have 1 + 3*(...)? Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3.\n\n2. Then, moving outward, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3).\n\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...), which is 8 times, because the innermost is just 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, that would mean that there are 8 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by counting 9 layers. Let me check again.\n\nIf the innermost is Layer1:1+3=4.\n\nThen Layer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer8), which would be 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer1:4.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n- Layer2:1 + 3*(Layer1) =1 + 3*4=13\n\n- Layer3:1 + 3*(Layer2)=1 +3*13=40\n\n- Layer4:1 +3*40=121\n\n- Layer5:1 +3*121=364\n\n- Layer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\n- Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\n- Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\n- Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, my initial approach was correct, with 9 layers.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought that the innermost is Layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer1:1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It resembles a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me try that approach.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, n=9:\n\na_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, if I can compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each into the next layer until I get to the outermost one. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting a bit bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Wow, this is increasing quickly.

Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 29,000 is 87,000, and 3 times 524 is 1,572. So, adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. That seems correct. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost Layer 1 and working outward, each layer's value was computed step by step, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3 at the end. I think that makes sense. Each time, I took the previous layer's result, multiplied it by 3, added 1, and then used that for the next layer. It's like a recursive process, each time building upon the previous value. This approach seems systematic and reduces the problem to smaller, manageable parts. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems manageable. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364. Hmm, let's break it down: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let me go back through each layer quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a specific formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that could have predicted Layer 9 without computing each layer step by step. Each layer seems to be following the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula holds for all layers. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. That matches my step-by-step calculation earlier. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute Layer 9 directly, saving time. But since I was unsure at first, breaking it down step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes. Another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous layer and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth, hence the large numbers. It's interesting how the recurrence relation works here, each time multiplying by 3 and adding a constant, leading to a geometric progression. But regardless of the approach, whether step-by-step computation or using the closed-form formula, the result is the same. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I should be able to reach the solution. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 That was simple. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. I can break it down: 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), and I computed each one step by step. Let me just recheck a couple of the layers to be sure. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; +1,500 = 88,500; +60 = 88,560; +12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my answer is right.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, I should be able to find the value of the entire expression. Let me start computing each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500.\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60.\n\nAnd finally, 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing any of the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing multiple steps. Let me go back and check each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 again. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern or using a formula can help verify the result.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, but in our case, a=3, so the solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * C + (1)/(1 - 3) = 3^{n} * C - 1/2.\n\nBut let's check that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{part} = K.\n\nPlugging into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nLayer 1: n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4, L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: n=5, L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: n=6, L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: n=7, L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: n=8, L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach lead to the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each time we have 1 + 3*(something). If we expand all the layers, it's essentially a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see that.\n\nIf I write out the expression, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nBut if I expand each layer, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))).\n\nIf I keep expanding, it's similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's consider the expression without the outermost 3. That is, the inner expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, if I have n layers, the total would be (3^{n} - 1)/2, as per the formula above. But in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9, giving (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut maybe if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I denote E as the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 3*(1 + E/3). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me define E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But notice that inside the first parentheses, after the first 1 + 3*(...), the structure is similar to E but without the outermost 3. Let me denote F as the inner expression, so F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) with 8 layers. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*F). But F itself is similar to E but one layer less. Wait, this might complicate things. Maybe the recurrence relation approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since we have a formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nSo, all methods converge to the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so: 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Let me go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)) So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each time we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a recurrence relation can be found, perhaps. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, our recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)), so k = 3 and c = 1. Starting from Layer 1 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, etc., so maybe it's better to index it starting from n=1. Let me see. Let me try to model this. Let me denote L_n as Layer n. Then, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. So, we can write this as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recursive pattern. Each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (Layer 1), we compute each subsequent layer up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n3. **Multiply by 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, looking at the expression, each layer is inside the next. So maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let me try that. The innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct. Now, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, that's interesting. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, 3*4 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
