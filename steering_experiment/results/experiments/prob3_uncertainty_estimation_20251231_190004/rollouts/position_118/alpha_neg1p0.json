Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, but since we have a formula, it's quicker. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern right away, computing each layer step by step is a solid approach, especially since the number of layers isn't too large. It's good to verify each step to avoid arithmetic errors, which can easily happen with so many layers. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I'll double-check the multiplication just to be sure: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.
