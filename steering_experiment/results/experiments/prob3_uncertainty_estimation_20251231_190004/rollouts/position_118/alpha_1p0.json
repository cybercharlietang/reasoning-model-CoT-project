Since we have 9 layers, let me check if that's correct. Wait, actually, in our case, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. According to the formula, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Similarly, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches our earlier computation. So, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer, a_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which is exactly what we got earlier.

Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have saved time, but since I was working through it step by step, computing each layer made sense. It's good to verify using both methods to ensure that the answer is correct. So, to recap: Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 4.

    "text": " So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. So, to recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allowed me to derive a formula, which also led me to the same answer. So, I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
