But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. I think the solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which is the first term. Let me check if n starts at 1. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 =121 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify using a different method to ensure that there are no mistakes, especially with such a long expression. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3. Using a formula derived from a linear recurrence relation, we confirm that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that's where errors usually happen. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I could have used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try solving it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern in the numbers as I compute each layer. Let me list out the a_n values again: a_1 = 4 a_2 =13 a_3=40 a_4=121 a_5=364 a_6=1093 a_7=3280 a_8=9841 a_9=29524 Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. I can see that each term is growing exponentially, which makes sense because of the 3 multiplier. So, the growth is quite rapid, which is why even though we're starting with small numbers, by the ninth layer, we're already at over 29,000, and then multiplying by 3 gives over 88,000. I think that's about right. To be thorough, let me compute each a_n using the formula and confirm they match my earlier computations: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4 \u2713\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13 \u2713\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40 \u2713\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=121 \u2713\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=364 \u2713\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=1093 \u2713\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=3280 \u2713\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=9841 \u2713\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=29524 \u2713\n\nAll correct. So, the formula works perfectly, and each step checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work using two different methods (direct computation and recurrence relation), and both led me to the same result. So, I don't see any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I could have also noticed the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute directly, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer was a safer approach for me. Either way, both methods led me to the same conclusion, which is reassuring. So, I think I'm done here. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, that seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This looks like a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k = 3, c = 1. Let me write the general formula: a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So perhaps the indexing is a bit different. Let me adjust. Let me consider a_0 = 1 (the innermost term without any multiplication), then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. The closed-form solution can be found as follows: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we have. For n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, which is correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression evaluated to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute the layers again using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for each layer from 1 to 9, we have: Layer 1: n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = 4\nLayer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 13\nLayer 3: n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = 40\nLayer 4: n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = 121\nLayer 5: n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = 364\nLayer 6: n=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = 1093\nLayer 7: n=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = 3280\nLayer 8: n=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841\nLayer 9: n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I computed step by step. So, using the formula confirms the earlier results. Therefore, the final step is to multiply by 3, which gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to verify.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find A and B.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nWe can assume that for n approaching infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but since our n is finite (n=9), perhaps another approach is better. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both methods\u2014computing step by step and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result.

Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting with L_1 = 4, as we saw earlier. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. At n=1, L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result, which makes me more confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think that's solid.

    "text": " Wait, that's breaking it down into parts, but maybe a better way is to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Wait, but I think I might have missed a digit. Let me recount the digits in 29524. It's a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the product is 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, there's a 1+3(.... So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each opening parenthesis is closed after a certain number of layers. Wait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. ...1+3(...\n\n3. ...1+3(...\n\n4. ...1+3(...\n\n5. ...1+3(...\n\n6. ...1+3(...\n\n7. ...1+3(...\n\n8. ...1+3(...\n\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nThen, after 9 layers, it's closed. So, I think my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to Layer9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer9 again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me list each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original problem, the innermost part is 1+3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, but let me double-check the multiplication steps.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find A and B. At n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAs n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n will dominate unless A=0. But in our case, the solution is finite, so perhaps we can find a particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), where c is a constant to be determined.\n\nLet me try that. Let's assume a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c).\n\nExpanding, a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c.\n\nBut from the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, substituting, 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c.\n\nSimplify: 1 + c = 3c => 1 = 2c => c = 1/2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2).\n\nTherefore, the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n\nThus, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}.\n\nCompute b_1: a_1 = 4, so b_1 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nTherefore, b_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nThen, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (9*3^{n-1})/2 - 1/2 = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9*6561 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me recompute 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. The key was to recognize the pattern and compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also confirmed the result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me check my multiplication again because I might have messed up the carryover steps. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So yes, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so I think I labeled them correctly from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. Let me recount the layers: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I have nine layers, then yes, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which I computed as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when I compute nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can represent each layer with a variable to make it clearer. Let me define each layer as follows: Let a1 = 1 + 3 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 ... up to a9, and then the final answer is 3*a9. So, starting with a1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers. Let's list the values of a1 to a9: a1 = 4 a2 = 13 a3 = 40 a4 = 121 a5 = 364 a6 = 1093 a7 = 3280 a8 = 9841 a9 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can express a_n in terms of a_{n-1}. Well, from the definition, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I'm only dealing with n=9, maybe computing each step is faster. However, for completeness, let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a9, n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, a9 = 29524, and the final answer is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, that's correct. And then, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7      3\n   -----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\nWait, but the number is 29524, so the digits are: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, starting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7.\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the number is 88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d73\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d73=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Then the entire expression is 3\u00d7Layer9, which is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nBut let me double-check my earlier steps because this is a lot of layers, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting from Layer1:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer9 again. 3\u00d79841: 9841\u00d73.\n\nCompute 9841\u00d73:\n\n1\u00d73=3.\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u21922, carry 1.\n\n8\u00d73=24 +1=25 \u21925, carry 2.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +2=29 \u21929, carry 2.\n\nSo 9841\u00d73=29523, then 29523 +1=29524. That's correct.\n\nSo yes, Layer9 is 29524, and 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time it's (1+3(...)), and there are 8 more layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo from the inside out, the innermost is (1+3), then each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost.\n\nWait, the expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), right? Because each time it's 1+3(...), and there are 9 such instances.\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first ( after 3, each ( starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter 3(, there's 1, then each time another (.\n\nSo 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nNumber of opening parentheses: Let's see, starting from the first ( after 3, then each ( inside. Let me count:\n\n1. ( after 3\n2. ( after the first 1+3\n3. ( after the next 1+3\n...\nWait, maybe a better way is to note that each time you have a (1+3(...)), which adds another layer. So the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So the total number of layers is 9, as I initially thought.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me confirm that I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, no, perhaps the innermost is (1+3), then each time it's (1+3(...)). So from the innermost out, there are 9 layers. So my initial computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer9 being 29524, and then the entire expression being 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nLet me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This is a recursive structure where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method is much faster and less error-prone, especially for larger numbers of layers. It's always good to find a pattern or a formula when dealing with repetitive structures like nested expressions.\n\nSo, to recap, I first tried to compute each layer step by step, which worked but was time-consuming. Then, I recognized the pattern as a linear recurrence relation and solved it using the method for such recursions, which gave me a direct formula to compute a_n without having to calculate each layer individually. This not only saved time but also reduced the chance of making a calculation error.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next nested term)}\\). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me check one more time, just to be sure. Maybe I can compute the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nFinal: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstitute a_n^{(p)} = A into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 (correct)\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 (correct)\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 (correct)\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 (correct)\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 (correct)\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 (correct)\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 (correct)\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 (correct)\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows a recurrence relation. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer can be expressed using the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula to the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with nine layers.\n2. Compute each layer from the innermost outward using the recurrence \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n3. Alternatively, use the closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) for efficiency.\n4. For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n5. Multiply by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check the number of layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1+3(... So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n... and so on, until we have nine layers because each time we add another 1+3(...). Wait, actually, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3's inside. Starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, from the innermost, each layer is one more than the previous. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nAfter 3(, there's (1+3(... So, each ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n10. (1+3\n\nWait, that's ten opening parentheses? Hmm, no, let me see. Wait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each (1+3( is another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n10. (1+3\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, there's 1+3(... So, perhaps there are nine layers because each (1+3 is a layer, and the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3. So, the total number of layers is nine, meaning I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let's see, for n=1, we have L_1=4, which is correct. And the formula gives (3^{2}-1)/2=4, which matches. Similarly, for n=2, (3^3 -1)/2=13, which is correct. So, the formula seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). If I expand it all, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4)...)).\n\nBut since I've already used the recurrence relation and verified it with the closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- The expression is a nested multiplication of 3 with a sum of 1 and another similar expression.\n- Each layer can be computed by starting from the innermost and working outward.\n- The recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1=4 can be solved to find L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n- For n=9, L_9=29524.\n- Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Maybe there's a formula for such a series. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for 9 layers, computing each step is easier.\n\nBut just for knowledge, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 can be solved as follows:\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, yes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, the value at layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is the correct result. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure that I haven't made any arithmetic errors along the way.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. We then multiply this by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let's see if it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me double-check the layers to ensure I didn't make an error. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3(...), then moving out, each time another 1 + 3(...). Let me count: 1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see, perhaps there are 8 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost 3(...) makes it 9 layers? Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression properly. The entire expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers is 8, because after the initial 3*, there are 8 more layers of 1 + 3*. Wait, that might be the confusion. Let me try to parse it step by step. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then, each time moving out, we have another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, until Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 8). So, in total, there are 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps I was counting one too many layers before. Let me recount, starting from the innermost. Let's define Layer 1 as the innermost 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). ... Up to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8). So, I think I miscounted earlier. I thought there were 9 layers, but actually, it's 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, that means when I computed up to Layer 9, I was actually going one layer too far. Let me correct that. So, let's start again with the correct number of layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841. So, let's compute that: 3*9841. Let me do this multiplication carefully. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2. 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2. There's no more digits, so write down 2. So, 9841*3=29523. Wait, that's different from my earlier result. So, I think I confused the number of layers before, leading to an incorrect final answer. So, with 8 layers, the final result is 29523, not 88572. Hmm, that makes more sense because 29523 is a more reasonable number given the layers. Let me confirm each layer again to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Then, 3*9841 = 29523. So, the final answer should be 29523. I think earlier I mistakenly included an extra layer, which led to the incorrect final result. So, to avoid confusion, it's important to correctly count the number of nested layers. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", it's a new layer, and in this case, there are 8 such layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, after computing up to Layer 8 as 9841, multiplying by 3 gives 29523. I should also check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers. This resembles a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Alternatively, it's similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_8. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients. The general solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s is a_n = r^{n} * C + s/(1 - r), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. In our case, r = 3 and s = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * C + 1/(1 - 3) = 3^{n}*C - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = 3^{1}*C - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^9: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 So, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523. This confirms that the result is indeed 29523. I think this approach using the recurrence relation formula is more efficient and less error-prone than computing each layer manually, especially for larger numbers of layers. However, since the problem only has 8 layers, manual computation is manageable, but it's good to know the general method in case the number of layers increases. So, to summarize, by recognizing the pattern and applying the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the solution 29523. I feel confident that this is the correct answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 29523.\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3 starting from the right. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carries. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000 9000 *3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I should go through each layer again to check. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I let a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3a_{n-1}. So, for n=2, a_2=1 +3*4=13, which matches what I had before.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which would save me from computing each layer step by step.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and the particular solution is a constant if the nonhomogeneous term is constant.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, a_1=4. Let me check what n corresponds to. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4, then a_2=13, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nSo, using the general solution, a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Let's apply n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which is the final answer.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the step-by-step computation, and the closed-form solution confirms it. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous result):\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my calculation again because 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.

But wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Let me verify that because that might be where I went wrong. Let me go back through each layer to check for any mistakes. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n10. ...1+3))\n\nWait, actually, each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the innermost is the 9th layer, and then each layer wraps around. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try again. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers after the initial 3. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9, which is the innermost one, and then each layer wraps around. So, when I computed Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 13, up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large quickly. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at layer n, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can compute each a_n up to a_9, then multiply by 3. Let's compute them again:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I might have missed a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, a_9 is the innermost, and then we have 9 layers, each wrapping around. So, the computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check with a smaller number to see if the pattern holds. Suppose I have only one layer: 3(1+3) = 3*4 = 12. If I compute a1 = 4, then 3*a1 = 12, which matches.\n\nIf I have two layers: 3(1+3(1+3)) = 3(1+3*4) = 3(1+12) = 3*13 = 39. According to the recurrence, a1=4, a2=13, then 3*a2=39. Correct.\n\nThree layers: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1+3*(1+3*4)) = 3(1+3*13) = 3*40 = 120. According to the recurrence, a3=40, so 3*a3=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds. Therefore, with 9 layers, the result should be 3*a9=88,572. Hmm, but I'm still a bit unsure because the numbers are so large. Let me try computing a few more layers manually to see if I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nCompute a4: 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3a_p =1 => -2a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying with the recurrence relation and the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next innermost layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer, which might be time-consuming, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a geometric progression or something similar. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. The solution to such a recurrence is given by: a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - c/(1 - r) But wait, since r > 1, the formula might be slightly different. Let me recall the formula for the homogeneous and particular solutions. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * (a_0 / r) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that. Let's assume the recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 given. Then the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, but wait, actually, in our problem, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's similar. Let me adjust the indices. Let's say n starts at 1, so a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, in terms of the formula, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = (a_1) * 3^{n-1} + (1)*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, let me verify. The standard formula for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * (a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 is given as 4, so perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, let's write out the first few terms and see if we can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Let me see if these numbers correspond to any known sequence or if they follow a specific formula. Let's compute the ratio between successive terms: a_2 / a_1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25 a_3 / a_2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.0769 a_4 / a_3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025 a_5 / a_4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008 a_6 / a_5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.0000 a_7 / a_6 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.0000 a_8 / a_7 = 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.0000 a_9 / a_8 = 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.0000 So, as n increases, the ratio approaches 3, which makes sense because each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, so the dominant factor is 3. Therefore, the terms grow exponentially with base 3. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let's verify this for n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4/2) - 1/2 = (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me write that as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, meaning n = 9. Wait, but in our earlier calculation, a_9 = 29524. Let's check with the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, that matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this value, so 3*29524 = 88572. Let me just confirm this multiplication once more to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 20*3 = 60 4*3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers earlier on. Let me recount the layers step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be error-prone. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4.\n\nI remember that such linear recursions can be solved using the formula for the nth term of a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*L9, and L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144, then 177144/2=88572. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, maybe breaking it down like that isn't the best approach. Alternatively, I can just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Wait, but 29524 has only five digits: 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, maybe I confused the digits. Let me write it out properly. 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones. So, when multiplying by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. There are no more digits, so the carryover 2 would be written as 28, but wait, no, the next digit after 2 is the end, so the carryover would be added to the next higher digit, but since there are no more digits, it would just be 28. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me write it properly:\n\n  2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7       3\n-----------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

    "text": " Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 3 * 29524 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. But wait, did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check the layers because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a very large number, and maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere because the numbers are getting big so quickly. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Okay, I think I've double-checked each step, and the result seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find the general formula for each layer and compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Recurrence Formula**: Recognizing the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\), we derive the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For Layer 9, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down digit by digit would be better. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 6 8 2 8 5 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again: 29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is nothing, but we have a carry over of 2, so write that down.\n\nWait, that would make the number 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct because 30000*3=90000, and 29524 is a bit less, so 88572 is reasonable.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. So then 3*29524=88572. So that should be the final answer.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also find the steady-state solution by setting a_n = a_{n-1} = A. So, A = 3A + 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, substituting back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(-1/2) + B => 4 = -3/2 + B => B = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (-1/2)*3^n + 11/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: a_1 = (-1/2)*3 + 11/2 = (-3/2) + (11/2) = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (-1/2)*9 + 11/2 = (-9/2) + (11/2) = 2/2 = 1. Wait, but earlier I calculated a_2 as 13. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the recurrence.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier calculation, a_1 was the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on. So the indexing is from 1 to 9, where a_9 is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but in the closed-form formula, I assumed n starts at 1, so a_1=4, a_2=13, etc. Let me test the formula for n=2:\n\na_2 = (-1/2)*3^2 + 11/2 = (-1/2)*9 + 11/2 = (-9/2) + 11/2 = 2/2 = 1. But that's not correct because a_2 is 13. So there must be a mistake in my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the recurrence. Let me try solving the recurrence again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard solution method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So this formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more using the formula.\n\nSince a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer using the formula instead of manually calculating each time, but since I already did it manually and verified with the formula, I think it's solid.\n\nSo, the problem is solved by computing each nested expression step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, which gives us the final result after multiplying by 3.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, that's a geometric progression perhaps? Let me think about it. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Either way, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1. So, each layer is a term in the sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Computing up to a_9 gives 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer of 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9=88572. Both methods lead to the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a formula for the nth term of the sequence, the solution is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute each layer up to the 9th layer.\n2. Use the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\) for the nth layer.\n3. Multiply the 9th layer result by 3.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carryovers. Let me compute 29524 *3 step by step: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. Next: 3*3=9 +1=10, write 0, carryover 1. But wait, there are no more digits, so we write the 1. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just multiply 29524 by 3 digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n3*3=9, write down 9.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, I should get a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\nNow, the next digit is the second 9 (if any), but since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, the next digit after 9 is 5, but wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So after the 9, we have the 5, but actually, no, the digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So when we multiply 29524 by 3, we go digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.

So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9.

But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So each layer corresponds to one set, starting from the innermost. So I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see.\n\nThe recursive relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\nLn = 3*Ln-1 + 1, for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^(n), where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nLp = 3*Lp + 1\n\nSolving for Lp:\n\nLp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, using this formula, L9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication step.

Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final step: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, after checking each layer, I'm confident that the computation is correct.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake.

Each step checks out, so I think 88572 is the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it more efficiently without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the nth layer as L_n, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, which might be faster for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut in this problem, there are nine layers, so computing each step by step isn't too bad. However, knowing the formula could be helpful if the number of layers were larger.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the result of the computation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1.\n\nSolving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9.\n\na_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result. It seems that using the recursive formula and finding a closed-form solution was a more efficient way and reduced the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n} -1)/2, but since I had to derive it, that might not have been immediately obvious. But it's good to know that such patterns can often be modeled with recurrence relations, and solving them can save a lot of time, especially with many layers.\n\nIn summary, the problem required computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern. By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, I was able to find a formula that allowed me to compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which would have been time-consuming and prone to errors. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution, which allows us to compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\), starting from \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\) is solved to find a closed-form formula.\n\n3. **Closed-form Solution**: The general term is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Ninth Layer**: For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence might give a closed-form expression. Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " Wait, maybe breaking it down like that isn't the best approach. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, right? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I should go through each layer again to ensure that each step is correct. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm. Another approach could be to recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on up to a\u2089. Then the entire expression is 3a\u2089. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. When n=1: a\u2081 = C*3\u00b9 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. So, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds. For n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a\u2083=(3\u2074 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a\u2084=(3\u2075 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3\u00b9\u2070 is 59049, so a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Another way to think about this is to recognize that each layer is essentially building a number in base 3 or something similar, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. Alternatively, maybe we can see the pattern of the numbers we computed: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and an added constant each time. But regardless, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. Therefore, I think it's safe to conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I think I might have messed up the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, which was 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me verify each layer computation to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Suppose we have a function f(n) where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent f(n) is 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in this problem, we're computing f(9) and then multiplying by 3. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for f(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). Assume f(n) = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4. f(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

It's 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, I think I did 9 layers correctly, ending at Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count again. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. ... up to 9 times? Wait, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then each step out adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the inside out, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 is (1+3), Layer 2 is (1+3(Layer1)), and so on up to Layer9, which is (1+3(Layer8)). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as above. Therefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me try another approach: maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be error-prone. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the layers go from 1 to 9, so let's compute a_9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to compute 3*29524 is to break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is correct. Each step checks out, both by direct computation and by solving the recurrence relation. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can solve it step by step. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving the recurrence gives \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier steps because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication or addition. Let me go back and verify each layer computation. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern in the layers. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer. I think this confirms that the result is correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yeah, that's correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might have made a miscalculation in one of the layers. Let me check a few layers again. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the innermost expression, which is layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the exponent. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Correct. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
