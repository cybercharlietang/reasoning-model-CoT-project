Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did it digit by digit, I might have made a mistake in the placement. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x         3\n    ------------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nYes, that's correct. Each digit multiplied by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carryover 0.\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279? Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I started from the innermost, computed each layer step by step, and ended up with 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give me a closed-form expression, which could be useful if the number of layers were larger. Let's see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as: L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by: L_n = a^{n} * C + (b/(a - 1))*(a^{n} - 1), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, let me recall the standard solution for linear recurrence relations of the form x_n = a x_{n-1} + b. The solution is x_n = a^n x_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). So, in this case, x_n = 3^n * x_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But in our case, the initial condition is L_1 = 4, which is x_1 = 4. So, let's adjust the formula accordingly. If we consider n starting at 1, then x_1 = 3^1 * x_0 + (3^1 - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, maybe I should index it differently. Let me think: The standard form is x_n = a x_{n-1} + b, with x_0 given. So, in our case, L_1 = 4, which would correspond to x_1. So, perhaps it's better to write L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Then, using the formula for the solution of such a recurrence, which is L_n = (L_1 - c) * a^{n-1} + c, where c is a constant determined by the recurrence. Wait, maybe I should derive it.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 3 L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^{(h)} = A * 3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, assume L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have just continued computing each layer step by step, as I did initially, which also worked. But having a formula is helpful, especially if the number of layers were much larger, as it would save a lot of time.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations:\n\n1. Identified the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Computed each layer step by step, labeling them from 1 to 9.\n3. Each layer was computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n4. After computing Layer 9, multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n5. Cross-verified using a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, arriving at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I did the layer computations, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each layer is correct up to Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time it's 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3(...), there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So, that would mean 9 layers, right? So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1+3*(previous layer). So, my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Wait, but let me confirm by computing each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that the initial expression is correctly interpreted. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, my approach was correct.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this method is more efficient because it uses a formula rather than computing each layer step by step, especially when dealing with many layers. But since there are only nine layers, either method works. I just need to make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors, especially with the exponents. Let me confirm 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3 is indeed 88572. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series formula. Using this approach, we determine the value of the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Recognizing the pattern, we use the formula for the nth term of a geometric series: \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, which seems like a lot, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

So, 29524 is indeed Layer 9, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But wait, the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, yes, 3*29524 is the final answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it as a recursive function. Let's define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to f(9). So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug this into the recurrence relation: f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1) Substituting f(n) = A*3^n + B and f(n-1) = A*3^(n-1) + B, we get: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, set the left and right sides equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2 So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, f(9)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute f(9) using the recurrence relation again:\n\nf(1)=4\n\nf(2)=1+3*4=13\n\nf(3)=1+3*13=40\n\nf(4)=1+3*40=121\n\nf(5)=1+3*121=364\n\nf(6)=1+3*364=1093\n\nf(7)=1+3*1093=3280\n\nf(8)=1+3*3280=9841\n\nf(9)=1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3*29524=88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set. Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 (layer 1). Then each layer adds another 3(...). So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Because each time you have a new 3(...), so starting from layer 1 up to layer 9. So, my initial approach was correct. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 4, layer 2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.

Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try solving it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Starting from the first 3, the next is 1+3(...), so each time we have a new layer. Let me count: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\nAnd then the innermost is 1+3). So, yes, there are 9 layers, which correspond to n=9 in the recurrence relation. Therefore, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula I derived. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and then multiply the outermost result by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence might give a closed-form formula, which could be faster than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In this case, a = 3, b = 1, and L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, our recurrence starts at L_1 = 4, so maybe we need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me see. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, with L_0 = initial value. Here, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, to use the standard formula, let me set n = 9, because we have 9 layers. So, L_9 = 3^9 * L_0 + (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, L_0 isn't defined here because our first term is L_1 = 4. So, perhaps we need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, we can consider that L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Then, the solution would be L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + (some term). Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before! So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using both step-by-step computation and a recurrence relation approach, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to make sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yep, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous. Let me recall the formula for a geometric series: S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, the structure is a bit different because each term is nested inside the previous one. Maybe I can model it recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the outermost expression is 3*f(9). So, let's compute f(1) to f(9): f(1) = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads me to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I can think about solving the recurrence relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). The general solution for such a linear recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve for A and B using the initial condition f(1) = 4. Substituting n=1 into the general solution: f(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, for the recurrence relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging f(n) = B into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula also gives the same result. This makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think about the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Each time, the 1 is being multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a sum. Starting from the innermost: Each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. For example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is just 1. Let me try to model this. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Expanding this, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth. So, starting from the innermost 1: 1 is multiplied by 3^8, then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k. Wait, but in this case, the expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Let me compute that sum. The sum of a geometric series sum from k=0 to n of r^k is (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, n=8. So, sum = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, actually, the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is 9841, but in our earlier calculation, f(9) was 29524, which is 3 times this sum. Wait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3))) with nine layers. If I denote the innermost part as S, then each layer adds another 3*S. Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the layers with the exponents. Let me try again. Let me consider that each time you have 1 + 3*(...), and each ... is the next layer. So, if I have n layers, the value is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). As we saw earlier, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 88572. Alternatively, if I think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, it's equivalent to 3*(f(9)), where f(9) = 29524. So, the total is 88572. Alternatively, if I try to express the inner sum as a geometric series, I might have miscounted the number of terms. Let me try to write out the expression step by step. Let me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1s. Each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times another expression. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, there are nine layers, each contributing a 1. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on, up to nine layers. Therefore, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0. So, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is: sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Therefore, E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but earlier, using the recursive method, I got E = 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must be making a mistake in how I'm interpreting the layers. Let me check again. If I have nine layers, each contributing a 1, then the total number of 1s is nine. Therefore, the sum inside the outermost 3 is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is indeed (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But earlier, using the recursive approach, I got 88572, which is 3*29524. Wait, 29524 is f(9), which is 1 + 3*f(8). So, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the outermost 3 is multiplying the entire sum or just the inner expression. Let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 =13, then 1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to nine layers, which gives f(9)=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=88572. Alternatively, if I model it as a geometric series, I have to consider that each 1 is being multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, ..., up to 3^0. So, the sum is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*9841 =29523. But this contradicts the recursive approach. Where is the mistake? Let me check with n=1: If there's only one layer, the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Alternatively, sum from k=0 to 0 of 3^k =1, then 3*1=3. But that's not matching. So, clearly, the geometric series approach isn't directly applicable here because the structure isn't exactly a simple geometric series. The issue is that in the expression, each term is 1 + 3*something, which is different from a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Therefore, the sum approach may not directly apply unless we model it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer adds a term of 3^k, but the initial term is different. Let me try to think differently. Let me define the expression as follows: Let E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as S_1 =1 +3=4. Then, S_2=1 +3*S_1=1 +12=13. S_3=1 +3*S_2=1 +39=40. And so on, up to S_9=1 +3*S_8. Then, E=3*S_9. So, as we computed earlier, S_9=29524, so E=88572. Alternatively, if I try to express S_n in terms of a geometric series, I can write S_n =1 +3*S_{n-1}, which we solved as S_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and E=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572, and the confusion earlier was because the geometric series approach wasn't directly applicable without considering the recursive structure of the problem. So, in conclusion, after carefully working through each layer step by step and verifying using both recursive computation and the closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but let me check if I did the layers correctly. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any of them. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, the Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but I feel like that might not be right because when I look at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. But maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first '(', let's count how many times we have 1 + 3(...). Let me see: Each time, there's a 1 + 3(.... So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one. Then each layer adds another. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, 9 layers in total. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, I get 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems quite large. Let me verify the calculation for Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say, instead of nine layers, let's try with two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1))) So, innermost is 1 + 3 =4. Then next layer:1 +3*4=13. Then outermost:3*13=39. Let me compute it step by step: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Final:3*13=39. Correct. Alternatively, if I compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) with three layers: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Final:3*40=120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 +12)) = 3(1 +3*13)=3(1 +39)=3*40=120. Correct. So, my method works for smaller numbers. Therefore, applying the same logic to the nine-layer problem, I get 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, let me check that multiplication again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Yes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 up to n=9. Wait, actually, in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was the innermost, which corresponds to n=1, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which would be n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer. It seems consistent both by step-by-step computation and by using the closed-form formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 another way to verify. 29524 is 29,000 + 524. So 29,000 * 3 = 87,000. 524 * 3 = 1,572. Adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, so the final answer is 88,572? That seems a bit large, but considering the nested multiplication by 3 each time, it might be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers.\n\nWait, I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote L(n) as the value of layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p(n) = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, the value of layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, giving 4. Then Layer 2 is n=2, giving 13, and so on up to Layer 9, which would be n=9.\n\nSo Layer 9: L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but using the formula, can I express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}? Let me see. The outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the entire expression as (3^{11} -3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nThis method is much faster and reduces the chance of error from computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. But since the problem only had 9 layers, it was manageable, though a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well.\n\nEach layer is defined by L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Expanding this recursively:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L(n-2)) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L(n-2)\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} * L(0)\n\nWait, but L(0) would be undefined in this context. Alternatively, since L(1) = 4 = 1 + 3*1, perhaps the sum is up to 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me think. The expansion of L(n) would be:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3 and n terms. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). So, in this case, r=3, so the sum would be (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, but earlier I had L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, when n=1, L(1) = 4 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the geometric series or the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple methods lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's a bit different. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, as before. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. That's much faster and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000; 9000 * 3 = 27000; 500 * 3 = 1500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result. So, maybe that's correct. But just to be thorough, perhaps I can compute Layer 9 again. Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8. Layer8 was 9841. So, 3*9841: Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000; 800*3=2400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As above, 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time, but since the problem isn't too long, step-by-step is manageable. Wait, let me think if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 as 1 + 3, L2 as 1 + 3*L1, and so on, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L(n). The recurrence is linear and can be solved by iteration. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern. L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Hmm, so the general solution for L(n) can be found as follows. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L(n) = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we arrive at the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since the problem only had nine layers, step-by-step was manageable. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct, but just to be absolutely sure, let me verify the multiplication one more time. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can do it more directly: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 8 * 3 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should just compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 8*3=24+2=26, write 6, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, putting it all together from the right: 2, 7, 8, 5, 7, 8, 7, 6, 2, 8. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I think I misaligned the digits. Let me try again more carefully. Let's write it out:\n\n      29524\n    x     3\n    --------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.

Write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 only has 5 digits, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me correct that. Actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4, then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the results. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. Recognizing the pattern allows us to use a formula for the nth layer, confirming the result. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because 3 times 29524. Alternatively, I can compute it directly: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer: 1+3*previous. Layer 1:4 Layer 2:1+12=13 Layer3:1+39=40 Layer4:1+120=121 Layer5:1+363=364 Layer6:1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+29523=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I still get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, as I calculated earlier. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: positions are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7.\n\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15.

To be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to compute each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nEach term is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps we can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, which matches. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). That's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, when n=1, Layer 1 is 1+3=4, so a_1=4. Then, a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, as before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this recurrence, we can use the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. But in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me go through each step once more to ensure there are no calculation errors.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524:\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write down 7\n9 * 3 =27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8\nNo more digits, so write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me actually do the multiplication properly.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n2 *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\n9 *3=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n2 (the next digit, which is the ten-thousands place) *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 +60 +12 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct.)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Right.)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Yes.)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Okay.)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct.)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Yes.)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Right.)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Yes.)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I broke it down as 3*20000=60,000; 3*9000=27,000; 3*500=1,500; 3*20=60; 3*4=12. Adding those: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So that's consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to check is to compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute each layer, I get up to Layer 9 as 29,524, and then I multiply by 3 to get 88,572. But let me think again: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, each step is correct, right? Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer adds 1 + 3*previous. So, the process seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 88,572 seems quite large, but considering that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's possible. Let me check each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to see that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me test with n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but our Layer 1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe that formula isn't applicable here.\n\nWait, alternatively, let's think about the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, matches Layer 2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches Layer 9.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, the value is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each step again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent every time. I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation confirms the value at each layer, leading to the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524.

So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern, to confirm the result without computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2=29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I calculated earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is much more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify with the formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572. I think I've considered multiple approaches and checked my work, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. But when I was computing Layer 9, I had Layer 9 = 29524, and then 3 * 29524 = 88572. But let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let's go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nSo, it seems that my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4, then each layer is defined recursively. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me count again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me try to express this as a sum. If I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But since the inner expression is similar to E, except it's missing the initial 3*(...). Wait, actually, let me think. Let me define E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Then, the inner part is 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to E but without the initial 3. Let me denote the inner part as S: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Then, E = 3*S. But S itself can be expressed as S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the next inner part, and so on. However, this might complicate things because each S is similar but not identical to E. Alternatively, since we have a fixed number of layers (9 layers), it's easier to compute each layer step by step as I did before, or use the formula we derived. So, using the formula, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and E = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me check my multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Hmm, this seems tedious, but actually, I think I made a mistake in the initial breakdown. Let me try a different approach: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n- 5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- 9 *3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n- 5 *3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n- 9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- 9 *3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n- 5 *3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n- 9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7 \u2192 write 7\n5 *3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n9 *3=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n5 *3=15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n9 *3=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n5 *3=15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1\n9 *3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because 29524 has only 5 digits, so let's count properly:\n\nDigits of 29524:\n- Position 5: 2 (ten thousands place)\n- Position 4: 9 (thousands place)\n- Position 3: 5 (hundreds place)\n- Position 2: 2 (tens place)\n- Position 1: 4 (units place)\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\nPosition 1: 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\nPosition 2: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7\nPosition 3: 5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\nPosition 4: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\nPosition 5: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3=88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 *3:\n- 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927\n- 5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct. Let me just verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing them. Let me go through each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(4)=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(13)=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, 29524 is Layer 9, then 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the problem is solved by computing each nested layer from the inside out, then multiplying the outermost result by 3.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next one.\n3. After computing all layers, multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\nFollowing these steps:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
