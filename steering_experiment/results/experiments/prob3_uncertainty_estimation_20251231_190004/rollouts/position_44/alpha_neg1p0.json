Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, wait, that seems correct, but let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all layers check out.

    "text": " So adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1092? Let me check: 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Correct. So Layer 6 is 1093. Correct.)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was computing each layer, I assumed that each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). But the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))). Expanding this would give me 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but actually, each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. If I let E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), then the inner part is similar to E/3, but I think that approach might not directly help. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already found a closed-form, maybe it's better to stick with that approach.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer adds another term in the expansion, so the entire expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. So, the sum would be 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Wait, let me check that. If I expand the expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))))\n\nLet me expand it step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand this, each time I multiply by 3 and add 1, so it's similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but actually, the number of terms might be different because each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen E = 3*29524=88572\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as a sum, each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 8, multiplied by some factor. Wait, but actually, the expansion would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which would be 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to 9 terms. So, that's 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683. Let me add these up:\n\n3 + 9 =12\n\n12 +27=39\n\n39 +81=120\n\n120 +243=363\n\n363 +729=1092\n\n1092 +2187=3279\n\n3279 +6561=9840\n\n9840 +19683=29523\n\nThen, E =3*29523=88569? Wait, but that's different from the earlier result. Hmm, so now I'm confused because when I expand it as a sum, I get a different number.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I expand E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to 9 layers, is it equal to 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^8?\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer adds another power of 3. So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3 =4, which is 3^1 +1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 +3*4=1 +12=13=1 +3*(3 +1)=1 +3^2 +3^1.\n\nWait, no, 3*4=12=3^2 +3^1.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion is different. Let me try to see:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4=3^1 +1\n\nLayer2:1 +3*(3 +1)=1 +3^2 +3^1=1 +9 +3=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3*(1 +3*(4))=1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40=1 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1=1 +27 +9 +3=40\n\nSimilarly, Layer4=1 +3*(Layer3)=1 +3*40=1 +120=121=1 +81 +27 +9 +3=1 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1=121\n\nWait, so in general, Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, because Layer1=1 +3=4=1 +3= sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k.\n\nLayer2=1 +3 +9=13= sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k=1 +3 +9=13\n\nLayer3=1 +3 +9 +27=40= sum from k=0 to3 of 3^k=40\n\nWait, but 1 +3 +9 +27=40, yes.\n\nSimilarly, Layer4=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121, which is correct because 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40, +81=121.\n\nSo, each Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k.\n\nBut the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier.\n\nSo, for Layer9, n=9, sum from k=0 to9 of3^k=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of E as the sum from k=0 to8 of3^{k+1}=3*(sum from k=0 to8 of3^k)=3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3^9=19683, so (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, then 3*9841=29523, which is different from our earlier result. Wait, that can't be right because we know E=88572.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up the layers here. Let me clarify.\n\nEach Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of E as the sum from k=1 to9 of3^k, which would be sum from k=1 to9 of3^k= (3^{10} -3)/2= (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523, then E=3*29523=88569, which is different. Hmm, that suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I expanded E step by step, I got E=88572, which is 3*29524, and 29524 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, perhaps the correct way is to consider that each Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and E=3*Layer9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that matches our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers, then E=3*(sum from k=0 to9 of3^k)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to wrap up, the expression evaluates to 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Proceed Outward**: Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3=88572. Correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13 a_3=1+3*a_2=1 +39=40 a_4=1 +3*a_3=1+120=121 a_5=1+3*a_4=1+363=364 a_6=1+3*a_5=1+1092=1093 a_7=1+3*a_6=1+3279=3280 a_8=1+3*a_7=1+9840=9841 a_9=1+3*a_8=1+29523=29524 So, as I computed before, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), but maybe it's easier to solve it iteratively. Let's write down the terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13 a_3=1 +3*13=40 a_4=1 +3*40=121 a_5=1 +3*121=364 a_6=1 +3*364=1093 a_7=1 +3*1093=3280 a_8=1 +3*3280=9841 a_9=1 +3*9841=29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. To solve this, we can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2)=3C -1/2. So, 3C -1/2=4 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, and we found that a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative step-by-step approach and the general formula approach led me to the same result. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29524.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't add or multiply incorrectly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have approached this problem by recognizing that each layer follows a geometric progression or some recursive formula. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 a_2 = 13 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 a_3 = 40 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 a_4 = 121 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 a_5 = 364 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 a_6 = 1093 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 a_7 = 3280 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 a_8 = 9841 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 a_9 = 29524 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 Now, let's try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the computed value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093: 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1+3279=3280. Correct.)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1+29523=29524. Correct.)\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nNo more digits, so 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is the expression 3*(Layer 9) or is Layer 9 already multiplied by 3? Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer, which is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me just think again: sometimes when these problems are nested, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a new layer. Let me count the number of layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each parenthesis is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then, moving out, each time we have another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each layer is:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nBecause the expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, Layer9 is the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So, that's correct. So, 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem and see if the pattern holds. For example, if I have just 3(1+3(1+3)), what would that compute to? Let's compute that manually.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nFirst, innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost layer: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it step by step:\n\nStart with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute it as per layers:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:3*13=39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's see if my method gives the same result. Using the same approach as above:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer2=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have one more layer: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute this.\n\nInnermost:1+3=4\n\nNext layer:1+3*4=13\n\nNext layer:1+3*13=40\n\nOutermost:3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nInnermost:1+3=4\n\nThen, 3(1 + 3*4)=3(13)=39\n\nThen, 3(1 + 39)=3(40)=120. Correct.\n\nSo, using the same method, Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, then 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it works for the larger problem with 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer of 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute a few more layers manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nThat's four layers.\n\nCompute innermost:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nOutermost:3*121=363.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nInnermost:1+3=4\n\nThen, 3(1 + 3*4)=3(13)=39\n\nThen, 3(1 + 39)=3(40)=120\n\nThen, 3(1 + 120)=3(121)=363.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, each time, the method holds.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that for the original problem with nine layers, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough, so I'm ready to conclude that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we systematically simplify the expression step by step. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing all layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572  \n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Next: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry. Next: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.

Finally, the carry over 1. So writing it out: 89072. Wait, that's different again. Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should use a calculator to verify, but since I don't have one, I'll try to compute 29524 * 3 again.

Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nWait, hold on, the number is 29524, which is 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (ones). So when I multiply, I should have:\n\nStarting from the right (ones place):\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the result is 87572? Wait, but when I broke it down into place values, it was 88572. There's a contradiction here. Let me check the place values again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo this method gives 88572, which is different from the digit-by-digit method which gave me 87572. I must have messed up the digit positions in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try that again, writing each step carefully:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (ones). Wait, that's 88752? No, wait, no, the digits would be:\n\nStarting from the right, we have:\n\nOnes: 2\n\nTens: 7\n\nHundreds: 5\n\nThousands: 8\n\nTen thousands: 8\n\nSo the number is 88,752? Wait, that can't be because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 29524 * 3 should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 * 3 is 88,572, which is a 5-digit number. But according to the digit-by-digit, I have 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (ones), which is 88,752. But that's different from the place value method which gave me 88,572.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check each step again:\n\nNumber: 2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the digits from right to left are: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So the number is 88,752? But that contradicts the place value method which gave me 88,572. I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let me write the multiplication vertically:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo writing it out, the product is 88,752. But when I broke it down into place values, I got 88,572. This inconsistency is confusing. Maybe I should add 29524 three times to verify:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add them digit by digit:\n\n8 (ones) + 4 (ones) = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 (tens) + 2 (tens) = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n0 (hundreds) + 5 (hundreds) = 5. Write 5, carry 0.\n\n9 (thousands) + 9 (thousands) = 18. Write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 (ten thousands) + 2 (ten thousands) = 7 + 1 (carry) = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo the sum is 88,572. Therefore, the correct product is 88,572, and my digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. I probably misplaced a digit somewhere. Let me try the digit-by-digit again, more carefully:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that's 88,572. So I think earlier, I must have written the digits in the wrong order. The correct product is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. If I compute 29524 * 3, it's the same as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong because I must have misaligned the digits. So the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nSo, to recap, I started by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I had some confusion in the middle when I was multiplying 29524 by 3, but after verifying through different methods, I'm confident that 88,572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Because a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the computed value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

I think that makes sense because each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth, so the number gets quite large. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...).

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches what I got earlier. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I can check one or two layers to ensure that the pattern is correct. Let's go back a few layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as geometric series or using recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the answer using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 9840 +1 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 3*29524 again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit is 5 (since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, actually, let's write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n________\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it before, I thought 3*29524 was 88572, but I was unsure because it felt high. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...), but when I started, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, and Layer 9 as the outermost. But the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which we computed as 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of '1+3(' sections. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each '1+3(' is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first '(' after the 3 is the first layer: 1+3(...\n- Then inside that, another '(', so that's the second layer.\n- Continuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around the previous one. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct because each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Therefore, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Wait, but I feel like this number might be too large. Let me check a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a smaller version with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Let's compute this manually. Innermost: 1+3=4. Then next layer: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Then multiply by 3: 3*13=39. Alternatively, using my method: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Then 3*13=39. Correct. Now, let's do three layers: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))) Innermost:1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Then 3*40=120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))) =3(1 +3(1 +3*4))=3(1 +3(1 +12))=3(1 +3*13)=3(1 +39)=3*40=120. Correct. So, my method works for smaller cases. Therefore, applying it to the original problem with nine layers should give the correct result. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing the layers again, maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 +3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let me compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did before. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. After computing the innermost nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous layer's result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each step carefully. Starting over, perhaps I miscounted the layers or miscalculated somewhere. Let me recount each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have missed a step. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4. Let's check if this formula holds for n=1.\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. To double-check, let me compute 3^10 again to ensure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the expression actually has nine layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3(...)\n\nBut in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are nine instances of \"1+3(\", each followed by another set. So, that would imply nine layers, each corresponding to a_n for n=1 to n=9.\n\nWait, but when I computed a_9, it was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1.\n\n- Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(1+3(... eight more layers...))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each \"1+3(\" as a new layer, so the total number of layers is 9, each adding another 3 times a layer.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, yes, a_9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. The recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers is a_9 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result: 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is computed as 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. So putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. So, is 88572 the correct answer? Let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let's define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9. Then, the final result is 3*a9. So, it's a geometric series? Wait, no, it's a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of it as each layer being a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, it's (3^10 - 1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": ". Wait, no, that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that because I might have messed up the digits. Let me do it another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them step by step. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is a layer, and then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost, each time there's a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time after 3(, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times that happens. Starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), which is 8 more layers. Wait, no, let me see. Actually, each time you open a new (, you have another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+...). So, starting with 3(1 + 3(...)), so each 3( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the initial 3( starts layer 1, then inside it's 1 + 3(, which is layer 2, and so on until the innermost 1 + 3. So, how many layers? Let's see: Each time you have a 3(, that's a new layer. Let me count the number of 3( after the initial 3. So, starting from the first 3(, then inside, 3(, then another 3(, etc., until the end. So, the structure is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of 3( after the first one is 8, because each 3( adds a new layer. So, that would make 9 layers in total. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on up to Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me verify that because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try computing each layer again step by step, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each layer is computed correctly. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I multiplied correctly. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to verify.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous term. This seems like a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursively defined sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value, then built up each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one. Then, multiplying by the outermost 3 gave me the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a closed-form formula, which confirmed the result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I feel confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the next nested term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next term. There are nine layers, starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and each closing parenthesis corresponds to one layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3) is Layer 1. Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), and each time we have another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts: 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. ...(...(...(...(...(...(...(...(...))))))))) So, actually, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), and I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount. Let's parse the expression step by step: The entire expression is 3*(A), where A is (1 + 3*(B)), and B is (1 + 3*(C)), and so on, until the innermost part. Let's count the number of these nested expressions. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let's see how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: (1+3) Then, moving out, Layer 2: (1+3*(Layer1)) Layer 3: (1+3*(Layer2)) ... Up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances after the initial 3. Wait, no, let's see: The initial expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me write the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)\nLayer2: (1+3*(Layer1))\nLayer3: (1+3*(Layer2))\nLayer4: (1+3*(Layer3))\nLayer5: (1+3*(Layer4))\nLayer6: (1+3*(Layer5))\nLayer7: (1+3*(Layer6))\nLayer8: (1+3*(Layer7))\nLayer9: (1+3*(Layer8))\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, from Layer1 to Layer9. So, my initial calculation was correct, with Layer9 being 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that might not be the best approach, but it confirms the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method: 29524*3.\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo,\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I started, I considered the innermost as Layer1:1+3=4. Then Layer2:1+3*4=13, etc., up to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572. But let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, but each one corresponds to a new layer. However, the innermost one is just (1+3), without another (1+3( after it. So, actually, the number of layers is 9, as each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost one is just 1+3 without another layer inside. So, yes, 9 layers in total, from Layer1 to Layer9. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, just to make sure, I can compute each layer using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer from 1 to 9:\n\nLayer1: n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=4\n\nLayer2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13\n\nLayer3: n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40\n\nLayer4: n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=121\n\nLayer5: n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=364\n\nLayer6: n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=1093\n\nLayer7: n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=3280\n\nLayer8: n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=9841\n\nLayer9: n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nThe expression for L_n is indeed a geometric series sum: L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nWait, actually, the closed-form solution we found is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, for n+1 terms.\n\nYes, because the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, each layer L_n is equal to the sum S where n+1 terms, which makes sense because each layer adds another power of 3.\n\nSo, for example, Layer1: n=1, sum from 0 to1: 1 +3=4, which is (3^2 -1)/2=4.\n\nLayer2: n=2, sum from 0 to2:1 +3 +9=13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=13.\n\nAnd so on. Therefore, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can compute L_9 as (3^10 -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after verifying through multiple methods\u2014step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and geometric series sum\u2014I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

I think I did this correctly. So, the final answer is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. It's a geometric progression kind of pattern, but since each term depends on the previous one, it's more of a recursive computation. But since the number of layers is manageable (only 9 layers), computing each step by hand is feasible. If there were more layers, I might look for a formula or a pattern to generalize it, but for this problem, step-by-step computation works fine. I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula matches my step-by-step computations. So, using this formula, I can compute any layer without having to go through each step. That's pretty cool. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. This makes sense, and I feel confident that this is the correct answer now that I've cross-verified it using both step-by-step computation and the general formula for the recurrence relation.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

That matches my earlier result, so I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without calculating each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step layer computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.

But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute this multiplication again. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17.

Maybe I should just do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nWait, I think I might have miscounted the digits. Let me count how many digits are in 29524. It's 5 digits: 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n9 \u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover2.\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nWait, that's only 5 digits, so the result should be:\n\nFrom right to left:\n2,7,5,7,8.\n\nWait, but that would be 87572? Wait, let me check:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d73=12 \u21922, carryover1.\n- 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n- 5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n- 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n- 9 \u00d73=27 \u21927, carryover2.\n- The next digit is the first digit, which is 2: 2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 7 5 2. Wait, that would be 87752? Wait, that's not matching my previous total. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d73\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, so 29524 \u00d73 = 88572. So that's the correct result.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was trying to compute digit by digit, I thought it might be 87572, which is incorrect. So, the correct multiplication is 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure that each step was correct.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7Layer9=3\u00d729524=88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )). So, does that mean that each layer is multiplied by 3, starting from the innermost? So, perhaps I should have started with 1 + 3, then each time I go out a layer, it's 1 +3*(previous layer). Then, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, yes, that's what I did. So, 3*(Layer9) where Layer9 is 29524, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nAfter 3(, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would be 9 layers. So, Layer1 is the innermost, and Layer9 is the outermost, which is multiplied by 3. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as 1 +3*(previous layer). So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D \u21d2 D -3D =1 \u21d2 -2D=1 \u21d2 D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d24 =3C -1/2 \u21d23C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar expression)}\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\), which is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me count them:\n\n1. After the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is layer 1.\n2. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 2.\n3. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 3.\n4. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 4.\n5. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 5.\n6. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 6.\n7. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 7.\n8. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 8.\n9. Then another \"1+3(\" is layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is followed by another \"1+3(\", and so on, until we reach the innermost part, which is 1+3(...)), but how many times does \"1+3(\" occur after the initial 3?\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is 9, because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost is 1+3(...)), which is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers, with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, if that's correct, then the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is layer 1, then inside that, another \"1+3(\" is layer 2, and so on until layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier computation of 88572 should be correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem and see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have a simpler version with fewer layers. For example, let's compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) and see if the pattern holds.\n\nCompute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nNext layer: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nThen multiply by 3: 3*40=120\n\nAlternatively, compute step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1+3=4\n\nThen 1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nThen 1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nThen 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 +12)) = 3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1+39)=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, with 3 layers inside, we get 120. So, if we have 9 layers, it's going to be much larger, but the pattern seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nAssume solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). So, the innermost layer is a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1, and the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result. So, perhaps I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which would save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*a_9, since the outermost layer is 3*(...), and the innermost is a_1. So, we have to compute a_9 and then multiply by 3. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general form is a_{n+1} = c*a_n + d, where c = 3 and d = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided that c \u2260 1. Plugging in the values: a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying the denominator: 1 - 3 = -2. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(-2)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(-2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute a_9 using this formula. a_9 = (9/2) * 3^{8} - 1/2. 3^8 is 6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (9*6561)/2 - 1/2. Calculating 9*6561: 6561 * 9. Let me compute that: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. Adding them up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, 9*6561 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try computing one more layer manually to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's say Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6. Layer6 was 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9840. 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Wait, no, 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers compute correctly. Thus, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. There's a pattern here where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This kind of recursive structure can be represented with a recurrence relation, and solving it gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. It's a good reminder of how geometric series and linear recurrences can be applied to such problems. I also thought about whether there's a formula to compute this without going through each layer, and indeed, using the closed-form expression for the recurrence relation is a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, though it was a bit time-consuming and required careful attention to avoid arithmetic mistakes. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is effectively building a number that's a multiple of 3 plus 1, and each subsequent layer is scaling up by a factor of 3 and adding 1. This is similar to how numbers are constructed in base 3, but here each digit would be 1, and each place is multiplied by 3^n. However, in this problem, it's more about repeated multiplication and addition rather than base conversion. But it's an interesting observation. Anyway, after carefully computing each step and verifying with both iterative and formulaic methods, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the innermost value is found to be 4, and each subsequent layer is computed up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."
