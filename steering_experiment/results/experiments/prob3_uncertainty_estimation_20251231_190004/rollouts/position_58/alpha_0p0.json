    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, putting it all together: The innermost layer was 4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3 times the previous. After computing up to Layer 9, which was 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 29524 * 3: Let me compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. If L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, then assuming a steady state where L_n = L_{n-1} = C, we have C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's check what n is for each layer. Wait, actually, in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was 4, which would correspond to n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. Similarly, Layer 2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. So, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct, and using the recurrence relation formula gives the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result.

Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, but since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's try a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula to generalize this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. It seems like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = (3/2)*3 + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2. So, the general formula would be L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L_9). Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's consistent with the previous result. So, another way to compute it is to recognize that the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2, which equals 88572. That might have been a quicker way if I had noticed the pattern earlier, but since I was working step by step, it's good that both methods led me to the same answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I computed each layer step by step, ensuring that each multiplication and addition was correct. Then, I recognized a pattern in the layers, which led me to a recurrence relation. Solving that gave me a general formula for each layer, which I applied to the 9th layer. Multiplying that result by 3 gave me the final answer. I also cross-verified using the exponent formula, which confirmed the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, the outermost layer is computed as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, each being 1 + 3(...), but when I labeled them from 1 to 9, I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, which is correct. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, but it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Let me compute that:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3 = 3\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n8*3 = 24 +1 =25, write 5, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is four digits: 9,8,4,1.\n\nWait, no, 9841 is 9,8,4,1, so 9*3=27, 8*3=24, 4*3=12, 1*3=3.\n\nWait, but when we compute 9841*3, it's:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nBut there are no more digits, so we add the carry: 2. So the result is 29523. So, 9841*3=29523, which is correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524*3 again:\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524*3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I can compute a smaller version to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 +3=4.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen, 3*40=120.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4)) = 3*(1 +3*(13)) = 3*(1 +39)=3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, compute it as:\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4.\n\nNext:1+3*4=13.\n\nNext:1+3*13=40.\n\nThen, 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, my approach works for this smaller case, so it's likely correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4. Multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because I might have made an error somewhere.

But let me check Layer 8 again because when I did Layer 8, I had 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the digit-by-digit method:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, layer by layer, to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations.\n\nLet me list each layer with its value:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWait, so in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly and then apply the formula.\n\nBut since both methods gave me the same result, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again using the formula.\n\nFor example, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13.\n\na_3=(81 -1)/2=40.\n\na_4=(243 -1)/2=121.\n\na_5=(729 -1)/2=364.\n\na_6=(2187 -1)/2=1093.\n\na_7=(6561 -1)/2=3280.\n\na_8=(19683 -1)/2=9841.\n\na_9=(59049 -1)/2=29524.\n\nYes, all these match the earlier step-by-step computations.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't spot any errors in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 8 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. 3\u00d73280 is 9840, right? Because 3\u00d73000=9000, 3\u00d7280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's correct. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. Let's compute 3\u00d79841. 9841 \u00d7 3: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again, just to be sure. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I've got the right answer here. But just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to do each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me try to write out the first few layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. Each layer is adding another term in a geometric series where each term is 3^n, starting from n=0. Let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = 121\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each layer n is the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^n. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, which is 3 in this case. So, the sum for layer n would be (3^(n+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I've already computed:\n\nFor Layer 1: n=1, so (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor Layer 2: n=2, so (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\nFor Layer 3: n=3, so (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\nFor Layer 4: n=4, so (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, in general, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Wait, let me check again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... 9 times ... ))) So, the innermost Layer 1 is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, according to the formula, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) - 1)/2, since n=9. Let me compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, it would be 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * (59049 - 1)/2 = 3 * 59048/2 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is building a number that's one more than a multiple of 3, and each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in base 3. But maybe that's overcomplicating it for now. The key takeaway is that recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows for a more efficient computation without having to manually compute each layer, which would be time-consuming, especially if there were more layers.\n\nIn summary, the process was:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and realize each layer is a repetition of the same operation.\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n3. Recognize the pattern of a geometric series in each layer's computation.\n4. Use the geometric series sum formula to compute the outermost layer directly.\n5. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n6. Verify the result using both step-by-step computation and the formula to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis approach ensures that I don't make mistakes and that I understand the underlying structure of the problem, which is always helpful for more complex problems in the future.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this as a geometric series, we can compute each layer efficiently. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer and work outward:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 *3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Wait, but let me verify my computations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 +3 =4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's the same result as before, 88572. Therefore, using the formula, I also get 88572. This confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer. So, the problem is solved correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(term). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as such. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. Which is the same as before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, actually, let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, which is 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, layer 9 would be the outermost one. So, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct. I think I've got it.

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous layer by 3 and added 1. So, it's like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, which would be 29524. Then, the total is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence relation? Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence relation approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I might consider whether there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(previous term). That looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up a geometric progression, and perhaps there's a shortcut to compute the final value without computing each layer individually. But since there are only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. However, knowing the formula is useful because if the number of layers were larger, it would save a lot of time. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, the step-by-step approach is feasible. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4=13, 1 + 3*13=40, 1 + 3*40=121, 1 + 3*121=364, 1 + 3*364=1093, 1 + 3*1093=3280, 1 + 3*3280=9841, 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. All these steps seem correct, and using the formula also leads to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the expression by evaluating each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me go back and check each layer again, step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can help here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe it's easier to find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me write the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 and see if each step matches.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, each layer checks out. Thus, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. That's exactly what we have here. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

So yes, 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Let me just verify that I did each layer correctly. Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one step, which propagates through all the following steps. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recursive computation. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation with a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: the step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.

Let me think about whether this sequence forms a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 +3=4\n\na_2 =1 +3*a_1=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when we set the equation to a_n =3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1=4= C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, using this formula, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. It's reassuring to see that both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer step by step, but it's good to know that there's a formula here. It might have saved time if the number of layers were larger, but in this case, since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation was manageable.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I should check one more time the computation of each layer using the formula to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step calculation.\n\nCompute a_1 to a_9 using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait a minute, I feel like that's a big number. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), so it's like a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me check. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. It's 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, each of those is a layer. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the expression is a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But in this case, since each term is nested, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well, and it's a standard method for solving such problems. So, to summarize, the expression simplifies to 88572 when computed step by step, and the formula confirms that. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying the final result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.

Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on until we reach the outermost. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each \"(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(...) 2. ... (1+3(...) 3. ... (1+3(...) 4. ... (1+3(...) 5. ... (1+3(...) 6. ... (1+3(...) 7. ... (1+3(...) 8. ... (1+3(...) 9. ... (1+3(...))))) So, there are 9 layers in total. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was correct. So, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

So, multiplying the outermost 3 by Layer 9 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1, with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution. The homogeneous recurrence is Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n^p = B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with Layer 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches my earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier layers again because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which is a recursive structure. It resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it mathematically. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can compute a_n using this recurrence. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_{n} as defined. The outermost layer is a_9, because we have nine layers. Wait, let's check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So the innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, using the formula, we can see that the answer is 88572. Therefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since our layers go up to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), and since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer, using the formula. That's pretty cool. I guess recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation helped a lot. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving the recurrence relation, I found a closed-form expression that allowed me to compute the value quickly without manually calculating each layer, though doing it step by step also worked and confirmed the result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derived a closed-form solution, which simplified the computation. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it together, we get 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This recurrence relation is a linear one, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution. Let's try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation, specifically a non-homogeneous one. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. It's a good check because it confirms the result we got by manually computing each layer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or the calculations. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct value of the given expression.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, plus 1. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s say we have n layers. Then, the value at each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation: a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, for each layer, a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_n. Wait, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the first 3, so n=9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are 9 layers, the total would be a sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, but I need to check. Wait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3, then each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, in terms of the formula, the total expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Which is exactly what we found. So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. That's another way to get the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). After computing each layer up to 9, I get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula (3^{11} -3)/2, which is 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572.

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add them up: 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for this problem since it's only nine layers. But perhaps recognizing the pattern could help in the future. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step seems feasible and less error-prone for me. Another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result, which might be a good way to verify my earlier computation. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the innermost term a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's compute a_9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let's see. The innermost layer is a_1, and each outer layer increments n by 1. So, the outermost layer would be a_9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this method also gives me 88572, which confirms my initial step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which forms a geometric progression. But in this case, since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each step was manageable. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I don't see any mistakes. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here. Let me think if there's a way to represent this as a geometric series or something. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3, so maybe the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and the solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can see that each layer n has a value of (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the innermost layer is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, each layer's computation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form: 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the recurrence relation and the initial condition.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n+1} + B = 3*(A*3^{n} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*A*3^{n} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^{n+1} + 3B + 1\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n+1} + B\n\nRight side: A*3^{n+1} + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^{n+1} + B = A*3^{n+1} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n+1} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo,\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, but let me check this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which matches.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121, which matches.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, which matches.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, which matches.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, which matches.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier manual computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.

So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it. Let me think. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.
