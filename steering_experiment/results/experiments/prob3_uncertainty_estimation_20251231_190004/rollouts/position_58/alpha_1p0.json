    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Sometimes, these can be expressed as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B = 4. Now, to find another equation, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, the innermost expression would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, no, actually, let's see: Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Wait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be 3*a_9, where a_9 is as defined. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144. Dividing by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I expand it all, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to some number of terms. Wait, but actually, the nesting is such that each layer adds a higher power of 3. Let me think about how many layers there are. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer, and each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression without the outermost 3, it would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, all methods point to the same answer. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same answer, so I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next inner term).

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.

Each step seems correct. Let me just verify a couple of layers to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Wait, hold on. Wait, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Wait, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. Then, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to model this. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=2, L2=13: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 -4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, from the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2})/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but let me just verify by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if the approach works. Let's take a simpler case with fewer layers. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this manually and using the formula to see if it matches. Manually: Innermost:1+3=4. Next layer:1+3*4=13. Next layer:1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Using the formula: For n=3 layers inside: L3=(3^{4}-1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then, 3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.

Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 +3 =4. Then, each a_n is built from the previous term. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., as I computed before. So, the problem is essentially computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Now, I can try to find a general formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)}=C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 +3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Then, 59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572, as I computed before. So, using the formula, I can see that the value is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, which might be faster and less error-prone, especially for larger n. But in this case, since n=9, computing each layer step by step isn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula in case n is larger. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The problem is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(... nine times ...))). I recognized it as a recurrence relation where each term is 1 +3*previous term. I computed each layer from the inside out, getting each a_n up to a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. I also derived a formula for a_n, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is a term multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula for this. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). It's a nested expression with nine layers. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a linear recurrence, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If we expand this, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) which can be written as 3 + 3*3*(next layer) and so on. But since we already have the closed-form formula, it's easier to use that. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all steps seem correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))). Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, let's subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the answer, using the closed-form formula. That's probably a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer individually. But since there are only nine layers, either method works. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n = 1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, but when I multiply by 3, I get 88,572. Let me just make sure that each step is correct.\n\nLet me recount the layers:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4.

Let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 +3(...\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 +3(...)) is Layer1.\n\nThen, moving out, each (1 +3(...) is another layer. Let me count how many times I see \"1 +3(\".\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of \"1 +3(\" instances.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 +3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a (1 +3(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count the number of such layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then, moving out, each (1 +3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of (1 +3(...)).\n\nFrom the inside:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost is (1 +3(1 +3(...))).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write the entire expression and count the number of layers.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 +3)\n2. (1 +3(1 +3))\n3. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))\n4. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))\n5. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))\n6. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))\n7. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3)))))))\n8. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))\n9. (1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer9, that was correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. So that should be correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have a nested expression like this, it's similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Maybe there's a formula for it.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 =4.\n\nWait, but L_1 is 1 +3=4, L_2=1 +3*4=13, L_3=1 +3*13=40, etc.\n\nSo, in general, L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n =3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A =3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nThus, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a formula to confirm the nth term, and everything lines up. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). \n\nUsing the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 88572.

Wait, but let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Because if I messed up one layer, the entire result would be wrong. Let me recompute each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also think about whether there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence where each term is a function of the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute this: 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = (3*59048)/2. Compute 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Let me check one of the layers again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's pick Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, so write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula involving geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's consider a general case where we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Solving for x, we get x = 1 + 3x => x - 3x = 1 => -2x = 1 => x = -1/2. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), which seems like a recursive relation. So, if we let x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, x_2 = 1 + 3x_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form x_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = x_n^h + x_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, x_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1, x_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, x_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, x_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4, x_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, x_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, we can compute the result without having to manually calculate each layer, which would be especially useful if there were more layers. But since there are nine layers, it's manageable either way. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3^10 is indeed 59049, correct. 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. As we computed earlier, that's 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I've solved the problem correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here to compute this without going through each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, to find a closed-form solution for a_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence relation of the first order. The general solution can be found using the method for solving such equations. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, since each a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11} which is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. That's a good check. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same final answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculation: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for L_n, which would allow me to compute the value without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. Therefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, if I think of it as a recursive sequence, maybe there's a formula for it. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's also consider n=0, but since the problem starts at n=1, maybe I can find another condition. Alternatively, let's assume that as n approaches infinity, the term approaches a limit, but that might not be necessary here. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\na_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant. To find D, we can set up the equation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nAssume a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) + 1\nC*3^n + D = 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D + 1\nC*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1\n\nSubtracting C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 3D + 1\n-2D = 1\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me substitute the recurrence into the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can also compute each layer step by step without using the formula, just to ensure that I didn't make any calculation mistakes earlier. Let's do that quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, same result each time. So, I think that's solid.\n\nI guess the key here was recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation. Both methods worked well, and cross-verifying them helped ensure the answer is correct.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is whether there's a way to compute this without expanding each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, expanding them isn't too bad. If there were more layers, maybe the formula would be more efficient, but for nine, both methods are manageable.\n\nI also thought about whether there's a geometric series involved here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be seen as a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but since each term is built upon the previous one, it's more of a linear recurrence rather than a simple geometric series. However, solving the recurrence relation gave me a neat formula that allowed me to jump directly to the 9th term without computing each step, which was helpful.\n\nIn summary, by carefully breaking down the problem, recognizing the recursive structure, and either computing each layer step by step or solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at the solution. It's always good to check my work using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with repetitive and nested operations like this.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we find the value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 *3 = 90000, but since it's 29524, which is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476*3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

But wait, I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications or additions. Let me pick a couple of layers to check in more detail. Let's check Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute this again. 29524 * 3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully checking each step, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helped prevent mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So the final answer is 88,572. Let me just verify that I computed each layer correctly because that seems like a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(inner expression). By computing each layer step by step, I found each subsequent layer's value, leading up to the ninth layer, which was 29,524. Multiplying that by 3 gave the final result of 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I found the same result without computing each layer manually, which was a nice check. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524, correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then, each a_n can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. First, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches our earlier calculation. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2=243^2. 243*243: 200*200=40,000, 200*43=8,600, 43*200=8,600, 43*43=1,849. Wait, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 243*243: 200*243=48,600; 40*243=9,720; 3*243=729. Adding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Yes, correct. So, 3^10=59,049. Therefore, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation here is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it formally. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, n=1: L_1=4, and the outermost layer is n=9. So L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if it aligns with the result I got. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to express a_n in terms of a_1. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1=4\na_2=1 +3*4=13\na_3=1 +3*13=40\na_4=1 +3*40=121\na_5=1 +3*121=364\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Now, the general solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire original expression is 3 times this, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the general formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading up to the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me check that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each layer step by step seems manageable. I don't think there's a geometric series or any other formula that can simplify this because each term is dependent on the next, but let me think about it for a moment. If I denote each layer as L_n where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, with L_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. Similarly, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small, computing each step is straightforward. However, for practice, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution to efficiently compute the value. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote Layer n as a_n. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. Assuming a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but looking at our initial condition, a_1 = 4. Let's use n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula would be a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, as we calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner term. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a recursive formula.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to solve it using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Here, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c = 3, d = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each layer's value seems correct, and the multiplication at the end checks out. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is computed step by step. After computing the innermost nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me count the digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step because one mistake early on could throw off the entire calculation.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer adds another 3*something. If I consider the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, that's similar to S = 3*(1 + 3*(S')), where S' is a similar expression but one layer less. But since we have 9 layers, it's a finite series, not an infinite one. So maybe the approach of computing each layer step by step is more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, and going up to a_9. As we did before, using the recurrence relation, we can compute each a_n up to a_9.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute a_9 using the closed-form formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Therefore, (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication earlier when I did 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572, which matches my previous result. So, yes, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nAnother way to compute 29524 * 3 is to break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo,\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly from multiple angles, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the value at the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carryover 1. 9 + 9 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1. 2 + 2 +1=5, write down 5.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check that again.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that's right. So, 3 times that is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 has another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nEach time, there's another layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3. Let's count the number of 1+3 sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n4. 1+3(...)\n5. 1+3(...)\n6. 1+3(...)\n7. 1+3(...)\n8. 1+3(...)\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), each nested within the previous one. So, that's why I labeled them Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut I just want to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of '(' after the initial 3:\n\nEach '1+3(' starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, my earlier computation is correct with 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me check that again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit concerned because when I first saw the problem, I thought maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation instead of calculating each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. In such cases, the sum can sometimes be expressed in a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But since there are nine layers, it's a finite series, not an infinite one. So, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nAlternatively, since I already computed each layer step by step and arrived at 88572, maybe I can confirm that by another method.\n\nWait, another approach is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, alternatively, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. Good.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach yield the same result. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with such a nested and repetitive structure.\n\nIn summary, by either expanding each layer step by step or by recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same final value of 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a geometric progression or some other pattern. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. So, layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. If I let the entire expression be E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight layers inside. Wait, no, because each layer is similar. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding it step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Let's denote the innermost as S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. S_3 =1 +3*S_2=1 +3*13=40. S_4=1 +3*S_3=1 +3*40=121. S_5=1 +3*S_4=1 +3*121=364. S_6=1 +3*S_5=1 +3*364=1093. S_7=1 +3*S_6=1 +3*1093=3280. S_8=1 +3*S_7=1 +3*3280=9841. S_9=1 +3*S_8=1 +3*9841=29524. Then E=3*S_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier approach. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, S_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then E=3*S_9=3*29524=88572. So, all methods point to the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I computed each layer from the inside out, starting with 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). I did this up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get 88572. Let me check the computations for each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it's a recursive structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, indeed, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step manually is straightforward. Alternatively, I could express this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me try solving it that way. Assume L_n = A + C*3^n. Plugging into the recurrence: A + C*3^n = 1 + 3*(A + C*3^{n-1}) A + C*3^n = 1 + 3A + 3*C*3^{n-1} Simplify the right side: 1 + 3A + C*3^n So, equating both sides: A + C*3^n = 1 + 3A + C*3^n Subtract C*3^n from both sides: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = -1/2 + C*3^n. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = -1/2 + C*3^1 => 4 = -1/2 + 3C => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = -1/2 + (3/2)*3^n = -1/2 + (3^{n+1})/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's a good verification. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))), which is a geometric series. Let me recall that a geometric series has the form a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^n. But in this case, each term is 1 multiplied by 3 each time, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where r is the common ratio and B is a particular solution. Let me try to find the solution. First, the homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved some computation time, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, that's also a valid approach. Another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The formula I derived earlier captures that behavior perfectly. It's interesting how the numbers grow so quickly. Each layer is more than three times the previous one, which is why the numbers escalate into the thousands so fast. So, in conclusion, by either computing each layer step by step or by finding a general formula for the nth layer, I arrive at the same final result. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step computation. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
